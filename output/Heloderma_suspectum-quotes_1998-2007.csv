A Cdk5 inhibitor enhances the induction of insulin secretion by exendin-4 both in vitro and in vivo,"['Kitani, K', 'Oguma, S', 'Nishiki, TI', 'Ohmori, I', 'Galons, H', 'Matsui, H', 'Meijer, L', 'Tomizawa, K']",JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.2170/physiolsci.RP006607,AUG 2007,13,"Exendin-4 (Ex4) is a peptide found in the lizard Heloderma suspectum, and it has a high similarity to glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). It induces insulin secretion without the risk of hypoglycemic episodes. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a serine/threonine kinase that is predominantly expressed in neurons. Recent studies have shown that this kinase regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Cdk5 inhibition enhances insulin secretion under conditions of stimulation by high glucose, but not low glucose. In the present study, we examined whether R-roscovitine (R-ros), a Cdk5 inhibitor, enhances insulin secretion induced by Ex4. R-ros induced Ex4-dependent insulin secretion under conditions of high glucose, but not low glucose in MIN6B1 cells. The enhancement by R-ros was also observed in db/db mice, a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, long-term treatment with Ex4 and R-ros significantly improved HbA1c compared with treatment using only Ex4. These results suggest that a co-application of R-ros and Ex4 may become a promising therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes."
"The urinary bladder as a physiological reservoir that moderates dehydration in a large desert lizard, the Gila monster Heloderma suspectum
","['Davis, JR', 'DeNardo, DF']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.003061,APR 15 2007,14,"Animals inhabiting xeric environments use a variety of behavioral and physiological strategies to balance water budgets. We studied the potential contribution of the urinary bladder to osmoregulation in a large desert lizard, the Gila monster Heloderma suspectum. Here we present results of a series of in vivo laboratory experiments which tested the hypothesis that the Gila monster urinary bladder serves as a physiological reservoir, as in amphibians and chelonians, providing water that buffers increases in plasma osmolality when food and water are unavailable. Adult Gila monsters absorbed water from the urinary bladder into circulation and absorption of water from the urinary bladder and drinking water provided similar osmoregulatory benefits within 24 h, although drinking water provided a more immediate osmotic benefit. During food and water deprivation, plasma osmolality increased 2.5 times faster in lizards with an empty urinary bladder compared with those with a full bladder. During rehydration, stereotyped binge drinking behavior increased body mass nearly 22%, which resulted in a 24% reduction in plasma osmolality and a substantial increase in bladder water within 24 h. These results support our hypothesis and demonstrate for the first time in an adult lizard that the urinary bladder can function as a long-term physiological water reservoir. This trait can provide a critical benefit to osmoregulation during the 2-to 3-month summer dry season characteristic of the deserts that Gila monsters inhabit."
Heads or tails? Sexual dimorphism in helodermatid lizards,"['Gienger, CM', 'Beck, DD']",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE,10.1139/Z06-198,JAN 2007,6,"We tested the hypothesis that helodermatid lizards (Gila monsters, Heloderma suspectum Cope, 1869, and beaded lizards, H. horridum (Wiegmann, 1829)) show sexual dimorphism in morphological traits related to male-male agonistic behaviors. Male-male combat in helodermatid lizards involves repeated sequences of ritualized grappling. Male Gila monsters use their heads in attempts to gain or maintain a superior position during repeated combat bouts that may last for hours. Pairs of fighting male beaded lizards form spectacular body arches, with abdomens adpressed and snouts, forelimbs, and tail tips contacting the ground. We measured body size, head size, and tail length in 208 preserved H. suspectum, and body size and tail length (but not head size) in 79 live H. horridum, then tested for sexual dimorphism using analysis of covariance. Male Gila monsters had proportionately larger heads than females but did not differ in tail length or body size. Male beaded lizards had proportionately longer tails than females and were larger in body size only when the largest individuals were included in the analysis. Differences in head dimensions (in H. suspectum) and tail length (in H. horridum) are likely the result of sexual selection acting through male-male agonistic behaviors in this unique lizard taxon."
"Absence of exendin-4 effects on postprandial glucose and lipids in the Gila monster, Heloderma suspectum
","['Christel, CM', 'DeNardo, DF']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY,10.1007/s00360-006-0115-6,JAN 2007,6,"Circulating nutrients serve as energy resources for functioning tissues throughout the body. While the tight regulation of plasma nutrients has been extensively studied in mammals, investigations into specific metabolic regulators in reptiles have been limited and have revealed conflicting results. The peptide exendin-4, which was isolated from the saliva of Gila monsters, Heloderma suspectum, has demonstrated prolonged plasma glucose-lowering properties in mammals. Although exendin-4 has often been labeled a venom protein, circulating plasma levels of exendin-4 have been shown to increase in response to feeding. Because exendin-4 has glucose-regulating effects in mammals, we hypothesized that post-prandial elevation in circulating exendin-4 levels in Gila monsters reduces plasma glucose and triglycerides. To examine the effect of exendin-4 on circulating nutrients, we measured plasma glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels of Gila monsters in response to one of four treatments: fed live mice (a natural post-prandial increase in exendin-4), force-fed dead mice while anesthetized (no post-prandial exendin-4 increase), force-fed dead mice while anesthetized and injected with exendin-4 immediately after feeding (exogenous increase in exendin-4), and force-fed dead mice while anesthetized and injected with exendin-4 24 h after feeding (delayed exogenous increase in exendin-4). After prey ingestion, glucose and triglyceride levels increased significantly over time in all treatment groups, but there was no significant treatment effect. Plasma exendin-4 levels showed significant time and treatment effects, but did not correspond to glucose and triglyceride levels. Our results demonstrate that plasma nutrient levels in Gila monsters respond relatively slowly to feeding and that exendin-4 does not have the same effect on circulating glucose in Gila monsters as it does in mammals. Further studies are necessary to determine whether circulating exendin-4 has an alternate role in regulating other components of energy metabolism such as nutrient uptake rate in the small intestine."

Exenatide in type 2 diabetes: treatment effects in clinical studies and animal study data,"['Gallwitz, B']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE,10.1111/j.1742-1241.2006.01196.x,DEC 2006,39,"The therapeutic options for treating type 2 diabetes have been widened by the introduction of exenatide as the first incretin mimetic. Incretins are gut hormones that contribute to the stimulation of insulin secretion after a carbohydrate rich meal. The incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) not only stimulates insulin secretion under hyperglycaemic conditions, but also suppresses glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying, induces satiety and improves beta cell function in type 2 diabetes. These beneficial effects have awakened the interest to use GLP-1 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Because of its short biological half-life, GLP-1 itself is not practical for type 2 diabetes therapy. Exenatide is a peptide found in the lizard Heloderma suspectum and has a high similarity to GLP-1. Exenatide belongs to the novel class of incretin mimetics because of its incretin-like action. It has a much longer biological half life than GLP-1 and is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that can be used for therapeutic purposes by twice daily injection. Clinical studies and clinical experience with exenatide have shown a significant reduction in HbA1c, fasting- and postprandial glucose and a marked reduction in body weight in type 2 diabetic patients. Animal studies reveal an improvement of beta cell function and an increase in beta cell mass after exenatide treatment. This review gives an overview on exenatide, its pharmacological profile and its role and potential in the therapeutic setting of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, future developments concerning exenatide application are highlighted."
Major contributions of comparative endocrinology to the development and exploitation of the incretin concept,"['Conlon, JM', 'Patterson, S', 'Flatt, PR']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1002/jez.a.312,SEP 1 2006,4,"An incretin is a factor released by the gut in response to nutrients that facilitates uptake of glucose by peripheral tissues. The incretin concept predates the discovery of insulin but it is now clear that incretins act by stimulating secretion of this hormone. As glucagon has insulin-releasing activity, it was speculated that intestinal glucagon-like immunoreactivity (enteroglucagon) was involved in the incretin effect but it was an achievement in the field of comparative endocrinology that led to the demonstration that the preproglucagon gene encodes the most potent incretin in the human. Characterization of cloned cDNAs encoding two preproglucagons from the Brockmann body of the anglerfish Lophius americanus demonstrated that the glucagon sequence is flanked by a 34 amino-acid-residue sequence with appreciable structural similarity to glucagon that was termed glucagon-like peptide (GLP). A 36 amino-acid-residue ortholog of anglerfish GLP was subsequently identified in human preproglucagon but this peptide had only weak insulin-releasing activity. However, alignment of GLP sequences from human and teleost fish showed that the human ortholog is extended from its N-terminus by a hexapeptide. Removal of this extension by an endogenous protease generates GLP-1-(7-36)amide, the potent and effective form of the incretin. More recently, comparative endocrinology has contributed to the exploitation of incretins as antidiabetic drugs. Exendin-4, a GLP-1 receptor agonist first isolated from the venom of the Gila monster Heloderma suspectum, is a clinically valuable, long-acting incretin and the skins of several species of frogs synthesize potent insulin-releasing peptides with therapeutic potential."

Although exendin-4 is considered a venom component, circulating plasma levels of exendin-4 have been shown to increase in response to feeding. Previous studies using mammals have demonstrated exendin-4 has prolonged plasma glucose-lowering properties. While these findings suggest a possible role of exendin-4 as a metabolic hormone in the Gila Monster, the mechanism controlling its release by the salivary gland has not previously been studied. We investigated possible factors driving exendin-4 release by testing Gila Monsters' response to one of six treatment groups: fed egg, fed juvenile rat, gastric intubation with egg while under anesthesia, olfactory stimulation from egg without ingestion, unfed control, and biting without feeding. These treatments were designed to separately test actions associated with feeding and different food types. We measured plasma exendin-4 levels using an immunoenzymetric assay before and at three time points after each treatment. Exendin-4 levels increased significantly in groups where considerable biting occurred but not in the other treatment groups. These results Suggest that exendin-4 is released from the salivary glands in response to mechanical stimulation and not the detection of food either by smell, taste, or distention of the gut. Further study of exendin-4 in its natural organism is needed to elucidate the functional role of exendin-4 as a venom component and/or a metabolic regulator. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Translocation of urban Gila Monsters: a problematic conservation tool,"['Sullivan, BK', 'Kwiatkowski, MA', 'Schuett, GW']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2003.07.002,MAY 2004,38,"The Gila Monster (Heloderma suspectum) is a large, venomous lizard protected throughout its distribution in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Rapid urban growth in key areas of its range and increased encounters with humans prompted us to investigate translocation as a conservation tool with ""nuisance"" Gila Monsters. Twenty-five Gila Monsters reported as nuisances by residents in the northeastern Phoenix Metropolitan Area were translocated from 0 to 25,000 m from their point of capture. Subjects (N = 18) translocated less than 1000 m returned to their original site of capture within 2-30 days; none of those (N = 7) translocated more than 1000 In successfully returned, they exhibited high daily rates of speed, and were deprived the use of familiar refuges. We conclude that small distance translocations within suitable habitats are ineffective in removing Gila Monsters from areas deemed unsuitable. Moreover, individuals moved significantly greater distances are unlikely to remain at a translocation site, and may experience a variety of costs (e.g., predation risk) associated with high rates of movement.

"Cloacal evaporative cooling: a previously undescribed means of increasing evaporative water loss at higher temperatures in a desert ectotherm, the Gila monster Heloderma suspectum
","['DeNardo, DF', 'Zubal, TE', 'Hoffman, TCM']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.00861,FEB 2004,18,"The Gila monster Heloderma suspectum is an active forager in an environment that, at times, can be extremely hot and arid. Thus, Gila monsters face extreme thermostatic and hydrostatic demands. For a desert ectotherm routinely risking dehydration, evaporative water loss (EWL) is typically viewed as detrimental. Yet evaporation simultaneously dehydrates and cools an animal. We explored EWL in Gila monsters by measuring cutaneous, ventilatory and cloacal EWL at five ambient temperatures between 20.5degreesC and 40degreesC. Our results show that Gila monsters have high EWL rates relative to body mass. Cutaneous EWL underwent a consistent, temperature-dependent increase over the entire range of test temperatures (Q(10)=1.61, with EWL ranging from 0.378 to 0.954 mg g(-1) h(-1)). Ventilatory EWL did not show a significant temperature-dependent response, but ranged from 0.304 to 0.663 mg g(-1) h(-1). Cloacal EWL was extremely low and relatively constant between 20.5degreesC and 35degreesC, but rose dramatically above 35degreesC (Q(10) > 8.3x10(7), from 0.0008 at 35degreesC to 7.30 mg g(-1) h(-1) at 40degreesC). This steep rise in cloacal EWL coincided with an increasing suppression of body temperature relative to ambient temperature. Dehydration to 80% of initial body mass led to a delay in the onset and an attenuation of the dramatic increase in cloacal EWL. These results emphasize the potential value of EWL for thermoregulation in ectotherms and demonstrate for the first time the role of the cloaca in this process."

Foraging mode and evolution of strike-induced chemosensory searching in lizards,"['Cooper, WE']",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,NA,APR 2003,4,"Strike-induced chemosensory searching (SICS) in lizards and snakes is a means of relocating prey by scent-trailing. The two main components of SICS are an elevated tongue-flick rate for vomerolfactory sampling after biting prey (PETF) and searching movements. In combination, these behaviors permit scent-trailing. Prey chemical discrimination, which is a prerequisite for SICS, is present in active foragers, but not in ambush foragers. Using comparative data, I show that searching movements and SICS have undergone correlated evolution with foraging mode and with prey chemical discrimination in lizards. This suggests that active foraging selects for prey chemical discrimination, which is then employed to search for escaped prey using the typical movements and tongue-flicking behaviors of active foragers. SICS in lizards is simply heightened active foraging after biting prey. In nonvenomous snakes, SICS is similar to that in lizards but is not restricted to active foragers. Only highly venomous snakes voluntarily release dangerous prey upon envenomation, pause to let the venom incapacitate the prey, and then relocate the prey by scent-trailing. PETF was observed in two ambush foragers and is not evolutionarily correlated with foraging mode or searching movements. Because it occurs in species lacking prey chemical discrimination, such PETF may be a response to gustatory cues or to internal chemicals not encountered on surfaces or trails of uninjured prey."
Habitat use by Gila Monsters: The importance of shelters,"['Beck, DD', 'Jennings, RD', 'TROPICAL AUSTRALIA']",HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,10.1655/0733-1347(2003)017[0111:HUBGMT]2.0.CO;2,2003,24,"Many desert organisms cope with extreme and variable conditions by retreating to sub-surface refugia, vet little is known of the patterns of refuge use by most desert inhabitants. We investigated shelter use by the Gila Monster, Heloderma suspectum, an ectotherm closely tied to sub-surface refugia in a strongly seasonal desert environment. We addressed hypotheses that ectotherms may use habitats based oil availability of shelters, select shelters based on particular cues, respond to seasonal variation in refuge characteristics, and show fidelity to specific retreats. Using radiotelemetry, we monitored microbabitat use by eight to ten Gila Monsters for six years, recording timing, frequency, and duration of visitation to over 250 specific shelters. We used transects to assess shelter availability, recorded structural features of all shelters, Laid used dataloggers to monitor seasonal changes ill microenvironments within subsets of shelters for periods up to two years. Shelters, and the habitats where they occurred, were not chosen by Gila Monsters at random. Heloderma spent more time ill areas where a higher density of potential shelters was available, and selected shelters based oil rockiness, slope and entrance aspect, depth, humidity, and temperature. Gila Monsters showed longer residence times and greater fidelity to shelters used during extreme periods (e.g., winter) and these patterns were paralleled by seasonal changes ill the characteristics of shelters chosen. Winter shelters tended to be south-facing, rockier, deeper, and warmer than those used ill other seasons, whereas dry-summer shelters were more soil-like in composition, cooler, and more humid. Gila Monsters showed strong fidelity to specific shelters, some of which were used by two or more lizards, sometimes concurrently. Seasonal variation in use of ""social"" shelters coincided with annual cycles of intraspecific behaviors and reproduction. Our results underscore the importance of sub-surface refugia ill file ecology of a sedentary desert ectotherm. Because many other ectotherms also spend significant periods sequestered in below-ground retreats, it is surprising that ecologists have not more extensively investigated this phenomenon. An understanding of the cues used by desert ectotherms to choose refuge-sites, the spatial and temporal variability ill refuge characteristics, and the fidelity shown to particular retreats, may help better explain patterns of habitat selection, behavior, distribution, and abundance."

To illustrate the technique we have RT-PCR-amplified a range of venom protein transcripts from cDNA libraries derived from the venoms of a hemotoxic snake, the Chinese copperhead (Deinagkistrodon acutus), a neurotoxic snake, the black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis), and a venomous lizard, the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum). These include a metalloproteinase and phospholipase A2 from D. acutus, a potassium channel blocker, dendrotoxin K, from D. polylepis, and exendin-4 from H. suspectum.

Glucagon is the earliest peptide hormone present at appreciable! levels in the developing pancreatic epithelium (embryonic day [E]-9.5 in mouse). Insulin accumulation begins slightly later (E11 in mouse), followed by a rapid accumulation during the ""second wave"" of insulin differentiation (similar toE15). Here we found that blocking early expression and function of glucagon, but not GLP-1, an alternate gene product of preproglucagon mRNA, prevented insulin-positive differentiation in early embryonic (E11) pancreas.

Medium-dependence of the secondary structure of exendin-4 and glucagon-like-peptide-1,"['Andersen, NH', 'Brodsky, Y', 'Neidigh, JW', 'Prickett, KS']",BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY,10.1016/S0968-0896(01)00263-2,JAN 2002,46,"Exendin-4 is a natural, 39-residue peptide first isolated from the salivary secretions of a Gila Monster (Heloderma suspectum) that has some pharmacological properties similar to glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1). This paper reports differences in the structural preferences of these two peptides. For GLP-1 in aqueous buffer (pH 3.5 or 5.9), the concentration dependence of circular dichroism spectra suggests that substantial helicity results only as a consequence of helix bundle formation. In contrast, exendin-4 is significantly helical in aqueous buffer even at the lowest concentration examined (2.3 muM). The pH dependence of the helical signal for exendin-4 indicates that helicity is enhanced by a more favorable sequence alignment of oppositely charged sidechains. Both peptides become more helical upon addition of either lipid micelles or fluoroalcohols. The stabilities of the helices were assessed from the thermal gradient of ellipticity (partial derivative [0](221)/partial derivativeT values); on this basis, the exendin helix does not melt appreciably until temperatures significantly above ambient. The extent of helix formation for exendin-4 in aqueous buffer (and the thermal stability of the resulting helix) suggests the presence of a stable helix-capping interaction which was localized to the C-terminal segment by NMR studies of NH exchange protection. Solvent effects on the thermal stability of the helix indicate that the C-terminal capping interaction is hydrophobic in nature. The absence of this C-capping interaction and the presence of a flexible, helix-destabilizing glycine at residue 16 in GLP-1 are the likely causes of the greater fragility of the monomeric helical state of GLP-1. The intramolecular hydrophobic clustering in exendin-4 also appears to decrease the extent of helical aggregate formation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."
Exendin-4 and glucagon-like-peptide-1: NMR structural comparisons in the solution and micelle-associated states,"['Neidigh, JW', 'Fesinmeyer, RM', 'Prickett, KS', 'Andersen, NH']",BIOCHEMISTRY,10.1021/bi010902s,NOV 6 2001,122,"Exendin-4, a 39 amino acid peptide originally isolated from the oral secretions of the lizard Heloderma suspectum, has been shown to share certain activities with glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1), a 30 amino acid peptide. We have determined the structuring preferences of exendin-4 and GLP-1 by NMR in both the solution and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelle-associated states. Based on both chemical shift deviations and the pattern of intermediate range NOEs, both peptides display significant helicity from residue 7 to residue 28 with greater fraying at the N-terminus. Thornton and Gorenstein [(1994) Biochemistry, 33, 3532-3539] reported that the presence of a flexible, helix-destabilizing, glycine at residue 16 in GLP-1 was an important feature for membrane and receptor binding. Exendin-4 has a helix-favoring, glutamate as residue 16. In the micelle-associated state, NMR data indicate that GLP-1 is less helical than exendin-4 due to the presence of Gly(16); chemical shift deviations along the peptide sequence suggest that Gly16 serves as an N-cap for a second, more persistent, helix. In 30 vol-% trifluoroethanol (TFE), a single continuous helix is evident in a significant fraction of the GLP-1 conformers present. Exendin-4 has a more regular and less fluxional helix in both media and displays stable tertiary structure in the solution state. In the micelle-bound state of exendin-4, a single helix (residues 11-27) is observed with residues 31-39 completely disordered and undergoing rapid segmental motion. In aqueous fluoroalcohol or aqueous glycol, the Leu(21)-Pro(38) span of exendin-4 forms a compact tertiary fold (the Trp-cage) which shields the side chain of Trp(25) from solvent exposure and produces ring current shifts as large as 3 ppm. This tertiary structure is partially populated in water and fully populated in aqueous TFE. The Leu(21)-Pro(38) segment of exendin-4 may be the smallest protein-like folding unit observed to date. When the Trp-cage forms, fraying of the exendin-4 helix occurs exclusively from the N-terminus; backbone NHs for the C-terminal residues of the helix display H/D exchange protection factors as large as 10(5) at 9 degreesC. In contrast, no tertiary structure is evident when exendin-4 binds to DPC micelles. An energetically favorable insertion of the tryptophan ring into the DPC micelle is suggested as the basis for this change. With the exception of exendin-4 in media containing fluoro alcohol cosolvents, NMR structure ensembles generated from the NOE data do not fully reflect the conformational averaging present in these systems. Secondary structure definition from chemical shift deviations may be the most appropriate treatment for peptides that lack tertiary structure."

The present study compares the pharmacokinetics of GLP-1 and exendin-4 in rats after intravenous (iv), subcutaneous (sc), or intraperitoneal (ip) administration. Samples were assayed for active GLP-1 (7-36) amide using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that does not detect GLP-1 (1-36-amide), (1-37), (9-36-amide) or (9-37). In parallel experiments, samples were assayed for exendin-4 using a two-site immunoradiometric assay that reacts specifically with full-length exendin-4. The estimated half-life for GLP-1 and exendin-4 were 0.8-4.7 min and 18-41 min for iv bolus, and 4.6-7.1 min and 90-216 min for SC administration, respectively. Half-lives after ip injection were 0.6-13.5 min for GLP-1 and 125-174 min for exendin-4. Bioavailability for GLP-1 and exendin-4 was 44-71% and 65-75%, respectively, for sc injection. For ip injection, bioavailability for GLP-1 and exendin-4 was 36-67% and 74-76%, respectively. Plasma clearance, as determined from iv infusion data, was 35-38 ml/min for GLP-1 and 4-8 ml/min for exendin-4. Both Co/C-max and AUC values were proportional to dose with each route of administration. Plasma clearance of exendin-4 was reduced by 4.4-fold in nephrectomized animals. In conclusion, exendin-4 exhibited a much longer plasma half-life than GLP-1 in rats after iv, sc, or ip injection, which may contribute in some part to reported differences in duration of biological action of the two peptides.

Evidence that the lizard helospectin peptides are O-glycosylated,"['Vandermeers-Piret, MC', 'Vandermeers, A', 'Gourlet, P', 'Ali, MH', 'Waelbroeck, M', 'Robberecht, P']",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY,10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01506.x,JUL 2000,5,"Six forms of helospectin (a vasoactive intestinal peptide analogue) were purified from the venom of the Heloderma horridum lizard. Their identification was performed by combining sequencing by automated Edman degradation and electrospray mass spectrometry analysis on the complete peptides and their tryptic fragments. The products resulting from the action of an O-glycosidase were also analysed. Two forms were identified as the previously named Hs1 and Hs2 of 38 and 37 amino-acid residues, respectively. Two forms corresponded to Hs1 and Hs2 O-glycosylated by a N-acetylhexosamine-hexose motif attached to the Ser32 residue. Two other forms were not completely characterized but might correspond to the O-glycosylated forms bearing a phosphate or a sulfate group. The glycosylation did not affect the capacity of the helospectins to recognize and to activate the human and the rat VPAC(1) and VPAC(2) receptors."
Lethal toxins of lizard venoms that possess kallikrein-like activity,"['Tu, AT']",NATURAL AND SELECTED SYNTHETIC TOXINS: BIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS,NA,2000,4,"The venoms of the lizard genus Heloderma contain many different types of proteins. Two types of Heloderma toxins, horridum toxin and gila toxin, were isolated in our laboratory. There are some similarities and some differences between these two toxins. For example, both toxins have kallikrein enzymatic activity, and the primary structure is also similar; moreover, they both have hypotensive effects when injected into rats. Gila toxin has a higher molecular weight and consists of 245 amino acid residues, while horricum toxin contains 210 residues. Both horridum and gila toxins are hemorrhagic, yet only horridum toxin causes exophthalmia. In this review article the chemical and several biological activities of these two toxins are compared extensively."
Morphology of the nasal capsule of Heloderma suspectum with comments on the systematic position of helodermatids (Squamata : Helodermatidae),"['Bernstein, P']",ACTA ZOOLOGICA,10.1046/j.1463-6395.1999.00020.x,JUL 1999,10,"A serially sectioned embryonic head of Heloderma suspectum formed the basis for a three-dimensional reconstruction of the cartilaginous nasal capsule and its membrane bones. Further, the soft parts of the nasal capsule were analysed microscopically. The embryonic nasal capsule is described and compared to the morphological conditions in other lizards, especially the varanids, which many recent authors believe to be their closest relatives.

The results support the close affinities between the helodermatids and the varanids. Both groups have a well developed recessus lateralis in a cartilaginous capsule, entered by the nasal concha. Further, in both groups a fragmentation of the cartilago paraseptalis occurs in a comparable location and form. Heloderma has no double lacrimal duct, in contrast to previous accounts, but the two canaliculi at the origin of the duct fuse noteworthy far ahead (in other squamates they fuse in front of the bulbus oculi). In the varanids the two branches of the lacrimal duct remain separate and open separately.

Some unique features of Heloderma are presented as well, above all the presence of a second concha."
"Glucose-lowering and insulin-sensitizing actions of exendin-4 - Studies in obese diabetic (ob/ob, db/db) mice, diabetic fatty Zucker rats, and diabetic rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta)","['Young, AA', 'Gedulin, BR', 'Bhavsar, S', 'Bodkin, N', 'Jodka, C', 'Hansen, B', 'Denaro, M']",DIABETES,10.2337/diabetes.48.5.1026,MAY 1999,290,"Exendin-4 is a 39 amino acid peptide isolated from the salivary secretions of the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum). It shows 53% sequence similarity to glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1. Unlike GLP-1, exendin4 has a prolonged glucose-lowering action in vivo. We compared the potency and duration of glucose-lowering effects of exendin-4 and GLP-1 in hyperglycemic db/db and ob/ob mice. Whereas reductions in plasma glucose of up to 35% vanished within 1 h with most doses of GLP-1, the same doses of exendin-4 resulted in a similar glucose-lowering effect that persisted for >4 h. Exendin-4 was 5,530-fold more potent than GLP-1 in db/db mice (effective doses, 50% [ED(50)s] of 0.059 mu g/kg +/- 0.15 log and 329 mu g/kg +/- 0.22 log, respectively) and was 5,480-fold more potent in ob/ob mice (ED(50)s of 0.136 mu g/kg +/- 0.10 log and 744 mu g/kg +/- 0.21 log, respectively) when the percentage fall in plasma glucose at 1 h was used as the indicator response. Exendin-4 dose-dependently accelerated glucose lowering in diabetic rhesus monkeys by up to 37% with an ED50 of 0.25 mu g/kg +/- 0.09 log. In two experiments in which diabetic fatty Zucker rats were injected subcutaneously twice daily for 5-6 weeks with doses of exendin-4 up to 100 mu g . rat(-1) . day(-1) (similar to 250 mu g/kg), HbA(1c) was reduced relative to saline-injected control rats. Exendin-4 treatment was also associated in each of these experiments with weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity, as demonstrated by increases of up to 32 and 49%, respectively, in the glucose infusion rate (GIR) in the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. ED(50)s for weight loss and the increase in clamp GIR were 1.0 mu g/kg +/- 0.15 log and 2.4 mu g/kg +/- 0.41 log, respectively. In conclusion, acute and chronic administration of exendin-4 has demonstrated an antidiabetic effect in several animal models of type 2 diabetes."

Helospectin-like peptides: Immunochemical localization and effects on isolated cerebral arteries and on local cerebral blood flow in the cat,"['Uddman, R', 'Goadsby, PJ', 'Jansen-Olesen, I', 'Edvinsson, L']",JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM,NA,JAN 1999,4,"Helospectin I and II and helodermin are nonamidated, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-like peptides, isolated from the salivary gland venom of the lizards Heloderma suspectum and Heloderma horridum. Helospectin I has 38 amino acid residues and differs from helospectin II in that it has an additional serine residue at the C-terminus. Numerous nerve fibers containing helospectin-like immunoreactivity (LI) and a few fibers containing helodermin-LI were present in the adventitia and at the adventitia-media border of cat cerebral arteries. In the sphenopalatine ganglion, numerous nerve cell bodies containing helospectin-LI were seen. Double immunostaining revealed that helospectin-LI nerve cell bodies coexisted with VIP-containing cell bodies. Radioimmunoassay showed high levels of helospectin-LI in extracts of cerebral vessels from the circle of Willis (27.4 pg/mg [wt/wt]). Helospectin I and II and helodermin (10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/L) produced concentration-dependent relaxations of feline middle cerebral arteries amounting to 50% to 80% of precontraction induced by U46619. The maximum effects and the potency were similar to that of VIP. Neither of these peptides elicited endothelium-dependent relaxations. Intracerebral microinjection of helospectin and helodermin produced a moderate concentration-dependent increase of the cerebral blood flow of alpha-chloralose anesthetized cats. The maximum increase (21 +/- 5%) was observed after the injection of 5 mu g helodermin, whereas 16 +/- 7% was seen with helospectin I and 19 +/- 5% with helospectin II. The results suggest that helospectin/helodermin-like peptides co-localize with VIP in perivascular nerve fibers originating in the sphenopalatine ganglion. They seem to have strong and potent vasodilator effects."
Black widow spider alpha-latrotoxin: a presynaptic neurotoxin that shares structural homology with the glucagon-like peptide-1 family of insulin secretagogic hormones,"['Holz, GG', 'Habener, JF']",COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,10.1016/S0305-0491(98)10088-3,OCT 1998,14,"alpha-Latrotoxin is a presynaptic neurotoxin isolated from the venom of the black widow spider Latrodectus tredecimguttatus. It exerts toxic effects in the vertebrate central nervous system by depolarizing neurons, by increasing [Ca2+](i) and by stimulating uncontrolled exocytosis of neurotransmitters from nerve terminals. The actions of alpha-latrotoxin are mediated, in part, by a GTP-binding protein-coupled receptor referred to as GIRL or latrophilin. Exendin-4 is also a venom toxin, and it is derived from the salivary gland of the Gila monster Heloderma suspectum. It acts as an agonist at the receptor for glucagon-like peptide-1(7-36)-amide (GLP-1), thereby stimulating secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells of the islets of Langerhans. Here is reported a surprising structural homology between alpha-latrotoxin and exendin-4 that is also apparent amongst all members of the GLP-l-like family of secretagogic hormones (GLP-1, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, secretin, pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating polypeptide). On the basis of this homology, we report the synthesis and initial characterization of a chimeric peptide (Black Widow GLP-1) that stimulates Ca2+ signaling and insulin secretion in human beta-cells and MIN6 insulinoma cells. It is also reported here that the GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors for alpha-latrotoxin and exendin-4 share highly significant structural similarity in their extracellularly-oriented amino-termini. We propose that molecular mimicry has generated conserved structural motifs in secretagogic toxins and their receptors, thereby explaining the evolution of defense or predatory strategies that are shared in common amongst distantly related species including spiders, lizards, and snakes. Evidently, the toxic effects of alpha-latrotoxin and exendin-4 are explained by their ability to interact with CTP-binding protein-coupled receptors that normally mediate the actions of endogenous hormones or neuropeptides.

The peptides were purified by HPLC and their primary structures were established as lungfish [Tyr(1),Gly(2),Ala(7),Pro(8)] BK, amphiuma [Phe(1),Ile(2),Leu(5)]BK, bullsnake and coachwhip [Val(1),Thr(6)]BK, Gila monster [Leu(2),Thr(6)]BK, and Gray's monitor [Thr(6)]BK. Monitor BK is identical to the peptide generated in turtle and alligator plasma and coachwhip/bullsnake BK shows one amino acid substitution (Ala(1) --> Val) compared with the peptide generated in the plasma of the python. The data provide further evidence for the widespread occurrence of a kallikrein-kininogen system in nonmammalian vertebrates but indicate that the primary structure of BK has been poorly conserved during evolution.

Molecular cloning of the helodermin and exendin-4 cDNAs in the lizard - Relationship to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 and evidence against the existence of mammalian homologues,"['Pohl, M', 'Wank, SA']",JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY,10.1074/jbc.273.16.9778,APR 17 1998,50,"Helodermin and exendin-4, two peptides isolated from the salivary gland of the Gila monster, Heloderma suspectum, are approximately 50% homologous to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), respectively, and interact with the mammalian receptors for VIP and GLP-1 with equal or higher affinity and efficacy, Immunohistochemical studies suggested the presence of helodermin-like peptides in mammals. To determine whether helodermin and exendin-4 are present in mammals and their evolutionary relationship to VIP and GLP-1, their cDNAs were first cloned from Gila monster salivary gland. Northern blots and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of multiple Gila monster tissues identified similar to 500-base pair transcripts only from salivary gland. Both helodermin and exendin-4 full-length cDNAs were similar to 500 base pairs long, and they encoded precursor proteins containing the entire amino acid sequence of helodermin and exendin-4, as well as a 44- or 45-amino acid N-terminal extension peptide, respectively, having similar to 60% homology, The size and structural organization of these cDNAs indicated that they were closely related to one another but markedly different from known cDNAs for the VIP/GLP-1 peptide family previously identified in both lower and higher evolved species. Cloning of the Gila monster VIP/peptide histidine isoleucine, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide, and glucagon/GLP-1 cDNAs and Southern blotting of Gila monster DNA demonstrate the coexistence of separate genes for these peptides and suggests, along with the restricted salivary gland expression, that helodermin and exendin-4 coevolved to serve a separate specialized function. Probing of a variety of rat and human tissues on Northern blots, human and rat Southern blots, and genomic and cDNA libraries with either helodermin-or exendin-4-specific cDNAs failed to identify evidence for mammalian homologues, These data indicate that helodermin and exendin-4 are not the precursors to VIP and GLP-1 and that they belong to a separate peptide family encoded by separate genes. Furthermore, the existence of as yet undiscovered mammalian homologues to helodermin and exendin-4 seems unlikely."

Surveys also requested information concerning the allocation of resources for conservation and research programs, staff educational background, and entry level salaries. Twenty-two institutions responded to the survey, collectively indicating a total of 164 technical papers, 16 field studies, and 101 nontechnical articles completed between 1987 and 1997. Of the 164 technical papers published, 130 (79%) were contributed by three institutions. Of the 16 field studies, seven were outside the United States, whereas nine focused on native species and ecosystems. Six of the reported field studies involved only financial or logistical support. Of the 101 non-technical articles, 42 (42%) were contributed by a single institution. Twenty-one formalized in-house research projects were reported. However, only four appeared to have a clearly defined objective. Survey respondents also reported nine species of reptiles and one amphibian taxon are managed by Species Survival Plans (SSPs). There are currently 12 Taxon Advisory Group (TAG) coordinators, with four of the current coordinators having served on multiple TAG committees. There are 41 AZA-approved studbooks for reptiles and two for amphibians, with 29 having actually been published to date. The average starting salary reported in our survey for entry level keeper positions was $19,500 (range, $13,500-30,000). The average level of education reported was high school graduate. There was no correlation between productivity and higher wages, or level of education. Only one institution received funding specifically for research. We conclude that zoo herpetology departments are not realizing their potential for formalized research and conservation projects and propose recommendations for future involvement.
