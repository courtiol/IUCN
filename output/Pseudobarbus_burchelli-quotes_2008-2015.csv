Predatory impact of non-native rainbow trout on endemic fish populations in headwater streams in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa,"['Shelton, JM', 'Samways, MJ', 'Day, JA']",BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,10.1007/s10530-014-0735-9,JAN 2015,2,"Non-native rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss have been widely introduced in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) at the south-western tip of Africa and may pose a serious threat to endemic freshwater fishes in the region. Quantitative information about trout impacts in the CFR is scarce but is urgently needed to guide legislation and management efforts. We used a combination of comparative and experimental approaches to evaluate impacts of introduced trout on native fish populations in headwater streams draining the upper Breede River catchment in the CFR. Fish populations were surveyed, and 19 environmental variables measured, in 24 minimally-disturbed streams, half of which had been invaded by trout. The mean densities of native Breede River redfin Pseudobarbus burchelli, Cape kurper Sandelia capensis and Cape galaxias Galaxias zebratus, were 89-97 % lower in invaded streams than in streams without trout. Furthermore, while native fish were present at all 12 sites without trout, they were not recorded at seven of the 12 invaded sites. None of the measured environmental variables differed significantly between sites with and without trout, and distance-based linear models identified trout density as the best predictor of redfin and kurper density, while galaxias density was best predicted by other environmental variables (riparian vegetation, canopy cover, substrate length, site slope). Native fish <= 40 mm in length were largely absent frominvaded streams, but generally abundant in streams without trout, and a field experiment confirmed that trout selectively consume small redfin. Taken together, these findings constitute evidence that trout have depleted the abundance of CFR-endemic fishes through size-selective predation. It is recommended that managers aim to prevent new trout introductions and consider eradicating trout populations where they pose a threat to highly threatened native species."
"Preliminary evaluation of the impact of invasive smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu on native fish abundance in the Witte River, Cape Floristic Region, South Africa","['Shelton, JM', 'Day, JA', 'Impson, ND']",AFRICAN ZOOLOGY,10.3377/004.049.0219,OCT 2014,0,"The impact of invasive smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu, on the abundance of two native fish species, Breede River redfin, Pseudobarbus burchelli, and Cape kurper, Sandelia capensis, was investigated in the Witte River tributary of the Breede River in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region (CFR). Native fish density was estimated in five pools and three riffles both above and below a 2 m-high waterfall that acts as a barrier to M. dolomieu. Both native species were relatively abundant (mean +/- S.E. fish/100 m(2): 152.10 +/- 19.16-10.33 +/- 6.06) at sites above the waterfall where M. dolomieu was absent, but absent or scarce (0-0.53 +/- 0.38 fish/100m(2)) at sites below it with M. dolomieu. There were no significant differences in measured environmental variables between sites above and below the waterfall, and M. dolomieu is thus implicated as the main factor responsible for the differences in native fish densities. These findings highlight the critical role of waterfalls in excluding non-native fishes from native fish refugia in the CFR."

Mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b (701 base pairs) and control region (601 base pairs) genes were sequenced to assess the evolutionary history of P. burchelli and evaluate the role of climatic and landscape changes in shaping patterns of genetic variation in this species. We identified three historically isolated lineages in P. burchelli: a widespread lineage that occurs across three isolated river systems and two geographically restricted lineages. The results were evaluated against predictions of the confluence of river systems during low sea levels of the last glacial maximum. Occurrence of the widespread Breede lineage in the Duiwenhoks River system is consistent with reconstructed palaeoriver systems. However, the occurrence of this lineage in the Goukou river system that formed part of the eastern Gourits-Goukou palaeoriver system can only be explained by translocation or a recent river capture or episodic inundation of low drainage divides. Extreme ecological gradients or the potential presence of instream physical barriers could have prevented an exchange of lineages between the Breede and Heuningnes river systems."
