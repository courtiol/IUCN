"Notes on the reproductive ecology of the Oaxaca Mud Turtle (Kinosternon oaxacae) in the vicinity of Mazunte, Mexico","['Gomez, AGV', 'Harfush, M', 'Macip-Rios, R']",ACTA HERPETOLOGICA,NA,2015,0,"Kinosternon oaxacae is one of the least known species of Mexican turtles. We conducted a preliminary survey from August to November 2013 in three localities on the coast of Oaxaca with the objective to increase and complement the knowledge of the reproductive ecology of Kinosternon oaxacae, including field data on nesting season, clutch size, egg size, and relative clutch mass. We found 21 females with eggs in their oviducts. With this sample we determined that the reproductive season extends from early May to early November. Clutch size averaged two eggs (similar to 1), and egg size averaged 30.61 (similar to 1.89) mm in length, 17.11 (+/- 0.69) mm in width, and 7.64 (+/- 0.57) g in mass. Relative clutch mass (clutch mass/gravid body mass) was 0.046 (+/- 0.023), and the smallest gravid female was 118.8 mm carapace length. No correlations of reproductive traits were found with body size, and no variation in reproductive traits or body size was detected among localities. Comparisons with related (scorpioides group) species were made."
