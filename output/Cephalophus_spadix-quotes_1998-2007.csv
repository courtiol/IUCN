"Notes on Abbott's duiker (Cephalophus spadix True 1890) and other forest antelopes of Mwanihana Forest, Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania, as revealed by camera-trapping and direct observations","['Rovero, F', 'Jones, T', 'Sanderson, J']",TROPICAL ZOOLOGY,NA,JUL 2005,18,"The Udzungwa Mountains of south-central Tanzania are part of an internationally outstanding area for biodiversity. This is reflected in the mammalian fauna and particularly in the forest antelopes: at least five species co-exist, including the Tanzanian endemic Abbott's duiker (Cephalophus spadix True 1890). Information on forest antelopes from Mwanihana Forest, one of the largest forest blocks within the Udzungwa Mountains, was collected by means of camera-traps and field observations. Eighty photographs of four antelope species were collected during 197 trap-days from four camera-trap sites. Seventy-one sightings were recorded during systematic counts and random survey walks for a total of 150 days of fieldwork. Results include the first photographs in the wild of Abbott's duiker, with one individual caught while holding what appears to be a frog in its mouth. The most photographed and sighted species was the Harvey's duiker (Cephalophus natalensis harveyi Thomas 1893), followed by the suni (Neotragus moschatus von Dueben 1846). Least photographed were Abbott's duiker and bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus Pallas 1766). The study shows the usefulness and potential of camera-traps to collect information on the presence, relative abundance and babits of antelopes in densely forested areas."
"Conservation priorities for the forests of the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania, based on primates, duikers and birds","['Dinesen, L', 'Lehmberg, T', 'Rahner, MC', 'Fjeldsa, J']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00218-4,JUN 2001,40,"Results are presented from 14 surveys in the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania. Forest fragments are ranked by occurrence of key species of primates, duikers and birds. Taken together, the West Kilombero Scarp forests, Mwanihana and Udzungwa Scarp have presumably viable populations of four Udzungwa endemics with the following total population estimates: Udzungwa colobus (Procolobus badius gordonorum 15,400), Sanje mangabey (Cercocebus galeritus sanjei 1350), Udzungwa forest partridge (Xenoperdix udzungwensis 3700) and rufous-winged sunbird (Nectarinia rufipennis 6850). The mountains are also strongholds for Swynnerton's robin (Swynnertonia swynnertoni), Iringa akalat (Sheppardia lowei), dapple-throat (Arcanator orostruthus), white-winged apalis (Apalis chariessa), Usambara weaver (Ploceus nicolli), and for Abbott's duiker (Cephalophus spadix). Appropriate village based conservation measures need to address questions about sustainable forest use, hunting and possibilities for forest regeneration in large tracts of fire-maintained grasslands.
