"Observations on the diet of the two-stripped garter snake Thamnophis hammondii in an oasis of Baja California Sur, Mexico","['Luja, VH', 'Rodriguez-Estrella, R', 'Sinervo, B']",REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD,10.7550/rmb.32185,JUN 2013,0,"Information is presented about the prey consumed by the two-stripped garter snake Thamnophis hammondii in a mountain oasis in Baja California Sur, Mexico. The diet of this threatened snake includes the Baja California treefrog Pseudacris hypochondriaca curta (native species), as well as an exotic fish: the red bellied tilapia Tilapia sp. cf. zilli. This exotic species has become invasive in Baja California Sur oases, displacing native fishes and becoming an important dietary resource to T. hammondii."
Speed and endurance of Thamnophis hammondii are not affected by consuming the toxic frog Xenopus laevis,"['Foster, CD', 'Mullin, SJ']",SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST,10.1894/WL-19.1,SEP 2008,0,"Toxins of Xenopus laevis elicit gaping responses in some snakes, but introduced populations of this species in California provide an additional food source for Thamnophis hammondii with no observable ill effects to the snake. This study addresses the locomotor performance of T hammondii after consuming this toxic frog. Endurance and speed of T. hammondii were measured along a 2-m long racetrack when subjects were not fed recently, when they were fed sunfish (Lepomis, a nontoxic prey), and when they were fed X. laevis. Snakes tended to be slower after eating, but ingestion of X. laevis did not affect either measure of locomotor performance in T. hammondii. Because performance of T. hammondii is not compromised, selective pressure against consumption of X. laevis probably is absent."
