"Isolation and characterization of six microsatellites in the Mexican beaded lizard Heloderma horridum
","['Feltoon, AR', 'Guerra, T', 'Lehn, C', 'Forstner, MRJ']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY NOTES,10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01609.x,MAY 2007,0,"Six polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized in the threatened Mexican beaded lizard, Heloderma horridum. The number of alleles per locus ranged from three to 12, with observed heterozygosity estimates ranging from 0.00 to 0.77, and expected heterozygosity estimates ranging from 0.00 to 0.73. These microsatellites will provide a valuable tool for the investigation of the genetic variation and structure of both wild and captive H. horridum populations."
Isolation and cloning of exendin precursor cDNAs from single samples of venom from the Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum) and the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum),"['Chen, TB', 'Kwok, H', 'Ivanyi, C', 'Shaw, C']",TOXICON,10.1016/j.toxicon.2005.11.004,MAR 2006,12,"Reptile venoms are complex cocktails of bioactive molecules, including peptides. While the drug discovery potential of most species remains unrealized, many are endangered and afforded protection under international treaties. In this study, we describe how potential clinically important bioactive peptides and their corresponding mRNAs can be structurally characterized from single, small samples of reptile venom. The potential type-2 diabetes therapeutics, exendin-3 and exendin-4, from the Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum) and the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum), respectively, have been characterized at both protein and nucleic acid levels to illustrate the efficacy of the technique and its contribution to biodiversity conservation.

"Glucagon-like peptide-1: From extract to agent. The Claude Bernard Lecture, 2005","['Holst, JJ']",DIABETOLOGIA,10.1007/s00125-005-0107-1,FEB 2006,127,"The incretin hormones are intestinal polypeptides that enhance postprandial insulin secretion. Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) was initially thought to regulate gastric acid secretion, whereas glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) was discovered as a result of a systematic search for intestinal insulinotropic products of proglucagon gene expression. The incretin effect is markedly impaired or absent in patients with type 2 diabetes because of decreased secretion of GLP-1 and a loss of the insulinotropic effects of GIP. Metabolic control can be restored or greatly improved by administration of exogenous GLP-1, but this peptide is almost immediately degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), and therefore has little clinical value. DPP-IV-resistant analogues (incretin mimetics) have been identified or developed, and inhibitors of DPP-IV have also proved effective in protecting endogenous GLP-1 (and GIP) from degradation. Both principles have been tested in clinical studies. The incretin mimetics, administered by sc injection, have demonstrated lasting improvement in HbA(1)c in patients insufficiently treated with conventional oral therapy, and their use has been associated with steady weight loss for up to 2 years. The DPP-IV inhibitors, given once or twice daily by mouth, also appear to provide lasting improvement in HbA(1)c, but are weight-neutral. The first incretin mimetic has reached the market in the US, and applications for approval of the first inhibitors are expected to be filed early in 2006."
"Aversive behavior of beaded lizard, Heloderma horridum, to sympatric and allopatric predator snakes","['Baldepas-Valdivia, CJ', 'Ramirez-Bautista, A']",SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST,10.1894/0038-4909(2005)050<0024:ABOBLH>2.0.CO;2,MAR 2005,3,"Twenty-two beaded lizards (Heloderma horridum) showed their capacity to discriminate chemical cues of 9 sympatric snakes (potential predators of lizards) and 6 allopatric snakes. The study demonstrated a previously unknown ability to recognize and avoid dangerous snakes by this helodermatid. Experiments revealed differences among escape latency (ESC) in 60-s trials for this behavior. Mean number of seconds +/-1 SD for Boa constrictor was 2.81 +/- 1.68, Loxocemus bicolor was 9.41 +/- 1.99, Crotalus basiliscus was 3.04 +/- 1.59, Agkistrodon bilinealus was 3.54 +/- 1.60, Drymarchon corais was 10.77 +/- 2.31, and Masticophis mentovarius was 16.05 +/- 2.17. Other sympatric snakes used as controls, Such as Micrurus distans, Timarphodon biscutatus, and Oxybelis aeneus, elicited no aversive behavior presumably because they do not feed on helodermatids. Experiments also showed antipredator behaviors were elicited by the allopatric snakes Charina trivirgata (16.27 +/- 1.88 s), Crotalus molossus (6.36 +/- 1.73 s), and C. triseriatus (52.09 +/- 2.31 s), but not by Micrurus limbatus, Pituophis deppei, or Pseudoelaphe flavirufa. We hypothesize that extension of this behaviour might involve phylogenetic relationship among sympatric and allopatric species of snakes in the same family. This behavioral response could have a pre-selective effect during geographical dispersion for some species like H. horridum."
"Exenatide: AC 2993, AC002993, AC2993A, exendin 4, LY2148568.",['[Anonymous]'],Drugs in R&D,NA,2004,0,"Exenatide [AC002993, AC2993A, AC 2993, LY2148568, exendin 4], a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist, is a synthetic exendin 4 compound under development with Amylin Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Both exendin 4 and its analogue, exendin 3, are 39-amino acid peptides isolated from Heloderma horridum lizard venom that have different amino acids at positions 2 and 3, respectively. Exendins are able to stimulate insulin secretion in response to rising blood glucose levels, and modulate gastric emptying to slow the entry of ingested sugars into the bloodstream. Amylin Pharmaceuticals acquired exclusive patent rights for the two exendin compounds (exendin 3 and exendin 4) from the originator, Dr John Eng (Bronx, NY, US). On 20 September 2002, Amylin and Eli Lilly signed a collaborative agreement for the development and commercialisation of exenatide for type 2 diabetes. Under the terms of the agreement, Eli Lilly has paid Amylin a licensing fee of 80 million US dollars and bought Amylin's stock worth 30 million US dollars at 18.69 US dollars a share. After the initial payment, Eli Lilly will pay Amylin up to 85 US dollars million upon reaching certain milestones and also make an additional payment of up to 130 million US dollars upon global commercialisation of exenatide. Both companies will share the US development and commercialisation costs, while Eli Lilly will pick up up to 80% of development costs and all commercialisation costs outside the US. Amylin and Eli Lilly will equally share profit from sales in the US, while Eli Lilly will get 80% of the profit outside the US and Amylin will get the rest. This agreement has also enabled Amylin to train its sales force to co-promote Lilly's human growth hormone Humatrope. Alkermes will receive research and development funding and milestone payments, and also a combination of royalty payments and manufacturing fees based on product sales. Alkermes undertakes the responsibility for the development of several initial formulations of the long-acting drug and manufacturing of the final product, while Amylin will be responsible for clinical trials, regulatory filings and worldwide marketing. The goal of the exenatide LAR programme is to develop a once-a-month injectable formulation of exenatide. In November 2003, Amylin announced positive results from the second of three pivotal, phase III studies that evaluated the effects of exenatide in combination with sulfonylureas in 377 randomised patients with type 2 diabetes. The design of the study was similar to that from the first study. The final third phase III study of exenatide was completed in November 2003. This study investigated the effects of exenatide in combination with metformin and sulfonylureas. Amylin and Eli Lilly announced that all of the pivotal phase III trials met the primary glucose control endpoint as measured by glycosylated haemoglobin. An NDA submission for exenatide is projected for mid-2004. A phase II, dose-ascending study in patients with type 2 diabetes was initiated in June 2002. This multicentre (US), double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety, tolerability and the pharmacokinetic profile of exenatide LAR in up to 100 patients with type 2 diabetes. A phase I study of exenatide LAR began in Europe in March 2001 and was completed in Q3 2001. A long-acting, sustained-release formulation of exenatide lowered both pre- and post-meal glucose concentration during a 24h period in patients with type 2 diabetes. In November 2002, analysts at Prudential Financial estimated that exenatide, pending approval, has the potential to reach sales of 477 million US dollars in 2006."
Envenomation by the Mexican beaded lizard: A case report,"['Cantrell, FL']",JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY-CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY,10.1081/CLT-120021105,2003,20,"Background: Envenomations by venomous lizards are rare. A single report of envenomation by a Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum) has been published. Further, anaphylaxis secondary to lizard envenomation has only been reported with the Gila monster. We report an envenomation that resulted in both systemic toxicity; and anaphylaxis. Case Report: A 40-year-old male was bitten on his hand by a captive Mexican beaded lizard. The patient experienced severe local pain, dizziness, vomiting, and diaphoresis. Upon arrival to the hospital, he was lethargic, vomiting, and in severe pain with marked swelling of his hand, lips, and tongue. His blood pressure was 110/63 mm/Hg with a pulse of 60 beats/minute. The patient's oxygen saturation decreased to 55%, and he required oxygen, although cyanosis was not observed. He was treated with normal saline, diphenhydramine, methylprednisolone, famotidine, ondansetron, morphine, and hydromorphone. The patient was admitted to intensive care where he continued to complain of severe pain requiring morphine. Local X-ray revealed only soft tissue swelling. Remarkable initial laboratory values included WBC 18,500 k/mm(3) with 80% segs. Over the next eight hours, the patient's symptoms gradually improved. He had persistent local swelling at the bite site along with erythematous streaking up the forearm. He had an uneventful hospital course until his eventual discharge the following day. Conclusion: Significant envenomations by members of the Helodermatidae family are rare. Systemic toxicity usually resolves within one to two days with supportive care. Prior envenomations may predispose patients to anaphylactic reactions."
Cloning and characterization of novel snake venom proteins that block smooth muscle contraction,"['Yamazaki, Y', 'Koike, H', 'Sugiyama, Y', 'Motoyoshi, K', 'Wada, T', 'Hishinuma, S', 'Mita, M', 'Morita, T']",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY,10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02940.x,JUN 2002,82,"In this study, we isolated a 25-kDa novel snake venom protein, designated ablomin, from the venom of the Japanese Mamushi snake (Agkistrodon blomhoffi ). The amino-acid sequence of this protein was determined by peptide sequencing and cDNA cloning. The deduced sequence showed high similarity to helothermine from the Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum horridum ), which blocks voltage-gated calcium and potassium channels, and ryanodine receptors. Ablomin blocked contraction of rat tail arterial smooth muscle elicited by high K+ -induced depolarization in the 0.1-1 mum range, but did not block caffeine-stimulated contraction. Furthermore, we isolated three other proteins from snake venoms that are homologous to ablomin and cloned the corresponding cDNAs. Two of these homologous proteins, triflin and latisemin, also inhibited high K+ -induced contraction of the artery. These results indicate that several snake venoms contain novel proteins with neurotoxin-like activity."
Evidence that the lizard helospectin peptides are O-glycosylated,"['Vandermeers-Piret, MC', 'Vandermeers, A', 'Gourlet, P', 'Ali, MH', 'Waelbroeck, M', 'Robberecht, P']",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY,10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01506.x,JUL 2000,5,"Six forms of helospectin (a vasoactive intestinal peptide analogue) were purified from the venom of the Heloderma horridum lizard. Their identification was performed by combining sequencing by automated Edman degradation and electrospray mass spectrometry analysis on the complete peptides and their tryptic fragments. The products resulting from the action of an O-glycosidase were also analysed. Two forms were identified as the previously named Hs1 and Hs2 of 38 and 37 amino-acid residues, respectively. Two forms corresponded to Hs1 and Hs2 O-glycosylated by a N-acetylhexosamine-hexose motif attached to the Ser32 residue. Two other forms were not completely characterized but might correspond to the O-glycosylated forms bearing a phosphate or a sulfate group. The glycosylation did not affect the capacity of the helospectins to recognize and to activate the human and the rat VPAC(1) and VPAC(2) receptors."
Helospectin-like peptides: Immunochemical localization and effects on isolated cerebral arteries and on local cerebral blood flow in the cat,"['Uddman, R', 'Goadsby, PJ', 'Jansen-Olesen, I', 'Edvinsson, L']",JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM,NA,JAN 1999,4,"Helospectin I and II and helodermin are nonamidated, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-like peptides, isolated from the salivary gland venom of the lizards Heloderma suspectum and Heloderma horridum. Helospectin I has 38 amino acid residues and differs from helospectin II in that it has an additional serine residue at the C-terminus. Numerous nerve fibers containing helospectin-like immunoreactivity (LI) and a few fibers containing helodermin-LI were present in the adventitia and at the adventitia-media border of cat cerebral arteries. In the sphenopalatine ganglion, numerous nerve cell bodies containing helospectin-LI were seen. Double immunostaining revealed that helospectin-LI nerve cell bodies coexisted with VIP-containing cell bodies. Radioimmunoassay showed high levels of helospectin-LI in extracts of cerebral vessels from the circle of Willis (27.4 pg/mg [wt/wt]). Helospectin I and II and helodermin (10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/L) produced concentration-dependent relaxations of feline middle cerebral arteries amounting to 50% to 80% of precontraction induced by U46619. The maximum effects and the potency were similar to that of VIP. Neither of these peptides elicited endothelium-dependent relaxations. Intracerebral microinjection of helospectin and helodermin produced a moderate concentration-dependent increase of the cerebral blood flow of alpha-chloralose anesthetized cats. The maximum increase (21 +/- 5%) was observed after the injection of 5 mu g helodermin, whereas 16 +/- 7% was seen with helospectin I and 19 +/- 5% with helospectin II. The results suggest that helospectin/helodermin-like peptides co-localize with VIP in perivascular nerve fibers originating in the sphenopalatine ganglion. They seem to have strong and potent vasodilator effects."
