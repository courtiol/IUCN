Interference of the Histone Deacetylase Inhibits Pollen Germination and Pollen Tube Growth in Picea wilsonii Mast,"['Cui, YN', 'Ling, Y', 'Zhou, JH', 'Li, XJ']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0145661,DEC 28 2015,0,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is a crucial component in the regulation of gene expression in various cellular processes in animal and plant cells. HDAC has been reported to play a role in embryogenesis. However, the effect of HDAC on androgamete development remains unclear, especially in gymnosperms. In this study, we used the HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (NaB) to examine the role of HDAC in Picea wilsonii pollen germination and pollen tube elongation. Measurements of the tip-focused Ca2+ gradient revealed that TSA and NaB influenced this gradient. Immunofluorescence showed that actin filaments were disrupted into disorganized fragments. As a result, the vesicle trafficking was disturbed, as determined by FM4-64 labeling. Moreover, the distribution of pectins and callose in cell walls was significantly altered in response to TSA and NaB. Our results suggest that HDAC affects pollen germination and polarized pollen tube growth in Picea wilsonii by affecting the intracellular Ca2+ concentration gradient, actin organization patterns, vesicle trafficking, as well as the deposition and configuration of cell wall components."
"Integration of Visual and Olfactory Cues in Host Plant Identification by the Asian Longhorned Beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)","['Yv, FL', 'Hai, XX', 'Wang, ZG', 'Yan, AH', 'Liu, BX', 'Bi, YG']",PLoS One,10.1371/journal.pone.0142752,NOV 10 2015,1,"Some insects use host and mate cues, including odor, color, and shape, to locate and recognize their preferred hosts and mates. Previous research has shown that the Asian longicorn beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky), uses olfactory cues to locate host plants and differentiate them from non-host plants. However, whether A. glabripennis adults use visual cues or a combination of visual and olfactory cues remains unclear. In this study, we tested the host location and recognition behavior in A. glabripennis, which infests a number of hardwood species and causes considerable economic losses in North America, Europe and Asia. We determined the relative importance of visual and olfactory cues from Acer negundo in host plant location and recognition, as well as in the discrimination of non-host plants (Sabina chinensis and Pinus bungeana), by female and male A. glabripennis. Visual and olfactory cues from the host plants (A. negundo), alone and combined, attracted significantly more females and males than equivalent cues from non-host plants (S. chinensis and P. bungeana). Furthermore, the combination of visual and olfactory cues of host plants attracted more adults than either cue alone, and visual cues alone attracted significantly more adults than olfactory cues alone. This finding suggests that adult A. glabripennis has an innate preference for the visual and/or olfactory cues of its host plants (A. negundo) over those of the non-host plant and visual cues are initially more important than olfactory cues for orientation; furthermore, this finding also suggests that adults integrate visual and olfactory cues to find their host plants. Our results indicate that different modalities of host plant cues should be considered together to understand fully the communication between host plants and Asian longhorned beetles."
[Adsorption Capacity of the Air Particulate Matter in Urban Landscape Plants in Different Polluted Regions of Beijing].,"['Zhang, Wei-kang', 'Wang, Bing', 'Niu, Xiang']","Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue / [bian ji, Zhongguo ke xue yuan huan jing ke xue wei yuan hui ""Huan jing ke xue"" bian ji wei yuan hui.]",NA,2015-Jul,0,"Urban landscape plants, as one of the important factors of the urban ecosystem, play an important role in stagnating airborne particulates and purifying urban atmospheric environment. In this article, six kinds of common garden plants were studied, and aerosol generator (QRJZFSQ-I) was used to measure the ability of their leaves to stagnate atmospheric particulates (TSP and PM2.5) in different polluted regions. Meanwhile, environmental scanning electron microscope was used to observe changes in the leaf structure of the tested tree species. The results showed: (1)Among the tested tree species, the ability of coniferous species to stagnate atmospheric particulates was higher than that of broad-leaved species per unit leaf area. Pinus tabuliformis stagnated the highest volume of (3. 89± 0. 026) g . m-2, followed by Pinus bungeana of (2. 82 ± 0. 392) g . cm-2, and Populus tomentosa stagnated the minimum of (2. 00 ± 0. 118) g . cm-2; (2) Through observing the leaf microstructure morphology, coniferous species were found to have tightly packed stomas, stoma density and surface roughness higher than those of broad-leaved species, and they could also secrete oil; (3) In different polluted regions, the leaves of the same tree species showed significant difference in stagnating TSP. Per unit leaf area, the tree species leaves situated around the 5th Ring Road had higher ability to absorb TSP than the tree species leaves at Botanical Garden, while their abilities to absorb PM2.5 showed no significant difference; (4) In different polluted regions, significantly adaptive changes were found in leaf structure. Comparing to the region with light pollution, the outer epidermal cells of the plant leaves in region with heavy pollution shrank, and the roughness of the leaf skin textures as well as the stomatal frequency and villous length increased. In spite of the significant changes in plant leaves exposed to the heavy pollution, these plants could still maintain normal and healthy growth."

"Responses of vertical soil moisture to rainfall pulses and land uses in a typical loess hilly area, China","['Yu, Y', 'Wei, W', 'Chen, LD', 'Jia, FY', 'Yang, L', 'Zhang, HD', 'Feng, TJ', 'PLATEAU']",SOLID EARTH,10.5194/se-6-595-2015,2015,0,"Soil moisture plays a key role in vegetation restoration and ecosystem stability in arid and semiarid regions. The response of soil moisture to rainfall pulses is an important hydrological process, which is strongly influenced by land use during the implementation of vegetation restoration. In this study, vertical soil moisture variations of woodland (Pinus tabulaeformis), native grassland (Stipa bungeana), shrubland (Hippophea rhamnoides), cropland (Triticum aestivum) and artificial grassland (Onobrychis viciaefolia) in five soil profiles were monitored in a typical loess hilly area during the 2010 growing season. The results demonstrated that rainfall pulses directly affected soil moisture variation. A multi-peak pattern of soil moisture appeared during the growing season, notably in the surface soil layer. Meanwhile, the response of each vegetation type to rainfall was inconsistent, and a time-lag effect before reaching the peak value was detected, following each heavy rainfall event. The response duration of soil moisture, however, varied markedly with the size of rainfall events. Furthermore, higher soil water content was detected in grassland and shrubland. Woodland was characterized by relatively lower soil moisture values throughout the investigation period. Our research suggests that vegetation restoration efforts should give priority to grassland and shrubland at the research site. We suggest that more studies should be focused on the characteristics of community structure and spatial vegetation distribution on soil moisture dynamics, particularly within the grass and shrub ecosystems."
Dilute acid pretreatment differentially affects the compositional and architectural features of Pinus bungeana Zucc. compression and opposite wood tracheid walls,"['Zhou, X', 'Ma, J', 'Ji, Z', 'Zhang, X', 'Ramaswamy, S', 'Xu, F', 'Sun, RC']",INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS,10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.08.035,DEC 2014,1,"Compression wood represents a unique challenge for biochemical processing of sustainable biomass to produce biofuels and bioproducts on account of its highly lignified tracheids relative to opposite wood. In the current work, differentiating response of Pinus bungeana Zucc. compression wood and opposite wood tracheid walls to dilute acid pretreatment was elucidated by combining chemical and microscopic approaches. Dilute acid pretreatment released greater amount of hemicelluloses from opposite wood (91.0%) than from compression wood (31.2%). The dissolution of hemicelluloses was not uniform and varied across the tracheid wall. In addition, for both compression wood and opposite wood the heterogeneity in lignin distribution was enhanced, probably attributed to the lignin migration and relocalization. The ultrastructural arrangement of the cell wall was also altered with the pretreated opposite wood tracheid wall exposing more apparent cellulose microfibril bundles and less abundant globular structures compared to compression wood. The dilute acid pretreatment demonstrated that the greater recalcitrance of compression wood probably originated from the higher lignin content and the resulting more compact structure of the cell wall.

Impacts of de-icing salt pollution on urban road greenspace: a case study of Beijing,"['Li, ZY', 'Liang, YM', 'Zhou, JH', 'Sun, X']",FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING,10.1007/s11783-014-0644-2,OCT 2014,0,"De-icing salt contamination of urban soil and greenspace has been a common issue of concern in many countries for years. In the 2009/2010 winter, Beijing experienced a contamination accident resulting from the overuse of de-icing salt, reported as almost 30000 tons, which severely damaged urban vegetation alongside roadways. The methods of sampling and rating for both soil contamination and response of the plant populations were developed to rapidly assess this emergency environmental event. Results showed that the shrubs were more severely damaged than the arbors in terms of both degree and extent, as almost all of the surveyed shrubs were severely damaged from the salt contamination, while only about 1/4 of the recorded arbors were rated as ""severely injured"" according to the integral plant injury index. The rating of the injury level showed that the trees like Pinus bungeana, Sophora japonica, and the shrubs like Euonymus japonicus, Sabina vulgaris showed less tolerance to de-icing salt pollution. The patterns of vegetation damage demonstrated that the ever-green shrubs alongside roads and the deciduous arbors in the center of roads were most vulnerable to the salt damage."

Mean biomass of each tree component increased steadily as stands aged. Average growth rates and ratios of tree biomass to stand age increased with age. The ratio of below-to above-ground biomass remained relatively constant independent of stand age. Compared to DBH-H allometric equations, the DBH-only equations performed slightly better and are more efficient to apply. These new equations for lacebark pine are an important supplement to China's national tree biomass equations. These equations and the findings on biomass partitioning patterns during stand development are applicable for the accurate estimation of ecosystem carbon accounting and will contribute to the sustainable management of lacebark pine forests."

"2, 6-dichlorobenzonitrile Causes Multiple Effects on Pollen Tube Growth beyond Altering Cellulose Synthesis in Pinus bungeana Zucc","['Hao, HQ', 'Chen, T', 'Fan, LS', 'Li, RL', 'Wang, XH']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0076660,OCT 11 2013,4,"Cellulose is an important component of cell wall, yet its location and function in pollen tubes remain speculative. In this paper, we studied the role of cellulose synthesis in pollen tube elongation in Pinus bungeana Zucc. by using the specific inhibitor, 2, 6-dichlorobenzonitrile (DCB). In the presence of DCB, the growth rate and morphology of pollen tubes were distinctly changed. The organization of cytoskeleton and vesicle trafficking were also disturbed. Ultrastructure of pollen tubes treated with DCB was characterized by the loose tube wall and damaged organelles. DCB treatment induced distinct changes in tube wall components. Fluorescence labeling results showed that callose, and acidic pectin accumulated in the tip regions, whereas there was less cellulose when treated with DCB. These results were confirmed by FTIR microspectroscopic analysis. In summary, our findings showed that inhibition of cellulose synthesis by DCB affected the organization of cytoskeleton and vesicle trafficking in pollen tubes, and induced changes in the tube wall chemical composition in a dose-dependent manner. These results confirm that cellulose is involved in the establishment of growth direction of pollen tubes, and plays important role in the cell wall construction during pollen tube development despite its lower quantity."
The Formative Characteristics of Seogo-jeongsa & Sameun-jeong Byeolseo Gardens in Toerori Miryang,"['Woo, Lee Hyun', 'Rho, Jae Hyun']",Journal of Korean Institute of Traditional Landscape Architecture,10.14700/KITLA.2013.31.4.070,2013,0,"To widen prospect of villa as Korea traditional garden, the result of the research about constructional characteristics of Seogo-jeongsa and Sameun-jeong of Yeoju Lee family at Toero-ri, Miryang-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, Korea, is abstracted as below. Seogo-jeongsa(西皐精舍) and Sameun-jeong(三隱亭) was intended to practise retirement with sense of unity with the head residence, since Seogo-jeongsa was 340m far and sameun-jeong was 630m far away from head residence, which set within 1km. Although Seogo-jeongsa’s basic prop, Sameun-jeong’s timber, which are both from designer’s pen name and head residence name, “Hangjae(恒齋)” and “Yongjae(庸齋),” and Hanseoam have each different exposure, it is homogeneous as space configurational side in order to optimize the gaze leading effect and appreciated domestic trees from the pond, which is center of the garden and the significant facility. Method of direction of Seogo-jeongsa’s Hwalsudang(活水塘) and Sameunjeong’s pond of Sameun-ji(三隱池) gets attention by distinction. Especially, directing of 3 step water flow from behind to front and traditional pond method, called Bangji-Bangdo(方池方島), were very unique that any other place can be found. Also, the middle islet on the pond at both villa, which isn’t more supper, but more for the symbolic molding that seek a stone pagoda(石假山), is more interesting directing method as considering the relationship of the 3 stone pagoda imageries on the surface of Ghwayukchon(果肉泉)At the same time, Seogo-jeongsa and Sameun-jeong shows very different characteristics from traditional villa that adopted both domestic trees and foreign trees. Particularly, it is extremely exceptional case to plant vigorous needleleaf tree, such as Chamaecyparis pisifera, C. obtusa, Pinus bungeana, P. palustris, Sciadopitys verticillata, Metasequoia glyptostroboides and Cedrus deodara, on Sameun-jeong. Moreover, adopting foreign wild needleleaf trees for landscaping trees, such as a Torreya nucifera, Taxus cuspidata, P. parviflora, and foreign landsacping trees, such as P. bungeana, Cryptomeria japonica and C. obtusa tells planting trend of the late Joseon dysnasty era. Also, as we can know from 2 Jipgyeong(集景), which is 'Seogo-jabyoung 17 young(西皐雜詠十七詠)', and 'Sameun-jeong 12 Gyoung(三隱亭十二景)' which are set on both villa, the intend to expand the garden area is strongly shown by the natural forest directing. As a result, Seogo-jeongsa and Sameun-jeong, located at Toero-li Miryang, are sharing the traditional Joseon dynasty era’s custom, such as space and visual composition; however, it is different and attractive garden remains as a point of view of water directing, stone pagodas, and adopting foreign landscaping trees."
Comparison of Anatomy and Composition Distribution between Normal and Compression Wood of Pinus Bungeana Zucc.

Using fluorescence microscopy, the severity of compression wood was classed as a mild type for the reason that it did not contain all compression wood features. Chemical imaging by confocal Raman microscopy was used for analyzing the distribution of lignin and cellulose, as well as the functional groups of lignin in tracheid cell walls. By comparison with normal wood, highly lignified outer S2 layer [S2(L)], thicker Si layer, and obviously reduced lignification in the middle lamella were characteristic of compression wood. In addition, smaller microfibril angle was observed in the S2(L) region. The distribution of coniferyl alcohol and coniferyl aldehyde in normal and compression wood was enriched in S1 and S2 layers but lack in cell corner and/or S2L regions, which showed an opposite pattern to lignin distribution. Confocal Raman microscopy with high spatial resolution contributes to a further understanding of the differences between normal and compression wood in polymers distribution and molecules orientation in situ."

Significant differences were observed in the needle morphological characteristics among the five species. P. tabuliformis had the longest needle length and highest needle density, whereas P. bungeana had the highest chlorophyll content. P. densiflora and P. parvifiora had the maximum and minimum photosynthetic rate, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance across the five species. The differences in the chlorophyll fast fluorescence induction curves of the five species were mainly manifested in J-step and I-step. Although the five species had similar values of Fv/Fm, Fv/Fo and Tfm, P. parviflora had significantly higher values of dV/dt(o), dVG/d(o), V and Vi, but lower energy flux ratio psi(o), phiEo and phiRo, compared with the other four species. The low PSII activity and efficiency of P. parviflora might relate to its smallest Sm, Sm/Tfm and N. P. densiflora and P. parvifiora had the maximum and minimum vitality indices PI(ABS/CSo/CSm) and DF, respectively, and there existed significant positive correlations between the PI(CSo) and PI(CSm) and the net photosynthetic rate of the five species, suggesting that PI(CSo) and PI(CSm) could be used to estimate the photosynthetic activity of Pinus trees."

Physiological and Protein Responses to Drought in Four Pine Seedlings,"['He, CY', 'Zhang, JG', 'Duan, AG']",SILVAE GENETICA,NA,2012,1,"Physiological and protein responses to drought stress in four pine seedlings, Pinus armandi Franch. (Pa), Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. (Pt), Pinus bungeana Zucc. ex Endl. (Pb) and Pinus sylvestris L. var. mongolica Litv. (Ps), were investigated using differential proteomics and water physiological indices. Firstly, the water physiological data showed that the decline rate of net photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, leaf water potential, turgor pressure except for under moderate drought stress was as follows: Pa > Ps > Pt > Pb. Pb and Pa always maintained the highest and lowest swelling pressure, respectively. Secondly, cluster analysis of 343 proteins indicated that the four pine species were classified into three groups with a genetic distance coefficient of 0.065. That is, five-needle-pine group (Pa), three-needle-pine group (Pb), two-needle-pine group (Pt and Ps), and the genetic distance between Pb and Pa was the farthest. The result was consistent with the declined rate in above physiological indices. Finally, for the differential proteomics analyzed, a total of 13 different proteins (P values < 0.01) changed significantly, the number of differentially expressed proteins was more in Pa (accounting for 46.2%) than the other three species, and 8 proteins were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time -of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). These proteins are quite diverse in their functions and involved in photosynthesis, osmotic regulation and functioning as signal transduction. These results suggested that the sensitivities of the four pine species to drought were possibly related to genetic distance."

Our results indicate that with an increasing health level of the ancient trees, the soil bulk density decreased, and the soil compactness, total K, available K, total P and available P increased, however, soil pH and organic matter remained unchanged. This research provides the scientific basis for the rejuvenation and management of the ancient and popular trees in cities like Beijing."
Unequal distribution of ubiquitinated proteins during Pinus bungeana pollen development,"['Sheng, XY', 'Dong, XL', 'Zhang, SS', 'Jiang, LP', 'Tan, LL', 'Li, X']",TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,10.1007/s00468-010-0515-9,JUN 2011,2,"The production of gametogenesis is a charming and complicated event in higher plants, during that stage the protein population undergoes substantial alterations. But few attentions have been paid to the possible roles of the UPP in gymnosperm gametogenesis. In the present study, DNA-specific probe 4',6-dimidino-phenylindole was employed to assess Pinus bungeana pollen developmental stage. It was revealed that the division of pollen mother cell occurred in late April. The uninucleate microspore then underwent three asymmetric divisions, forming a mature pollen grain including a tube cell and a generative cell together with two degenerated prothallial cells in early May. Immunofluorescence labeling of ubiquitinated proteins (UbPs) with an anti-ubiquitin antibody indicated that fluorescence signal was detected in both cytosol and nuclear of the microspore at the uninucleate stage. In the two-cell pollen grain, a brighter fluorescence was always detected in the first prothallial when compared with that in central cell. Similarly, unequal distribution of UbPs was observed again during the division of the central cell into the antheridial initial and the second prothallial cell. The high intensity of the fluorescence in the two degenerated prothallial cells remained in the mature pollen grain, but only a faint signal could be detected in the tube cell or the generative cell deriving from the division of the antheridial initial. The unequal distribution of UbPs was further unveiled by immunogold labeling among prothallial cells, generative cells and tube cells in mature pollen grains. Besides, Coomassie brilliant blue cytochemistry was also performed to illustrate the general subcellular distribution of total proteins in the two-cell and matured pollen grains. All these results indicated that the prothallial cells have high ratio of UbPs, and that the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis might have an important role during pine pollen development."
Planting Patterns and Landscape Redevelopement of Pilam Seowon in Jangseong-Gun,['이원호'],Journal of Korean Institute of Traditional Landscape Architecture,NA,2011,0,"This study, as a purpose of base study for landscape redevelopement of Seowon, pointed out problems of planting patterns in each sector and suggested an alternative through analyzing old literature, complete enumeration survey in each sector and taking aerial images. the conclusions drawn from this study are as follows. A Pilam Seowon(historic site no 242) is located in a Pyungya-Sanrok(plain and mountain) district in Jangsung-gun and has Junhak-Humyo(Study room in the front and Shirne in the back) type. 23 taxonomic group of arbor, 6 taxonomic group of shrub and 5 taxonomic group of flowers are planted high-densitily in limited flat surface. It can be classified into being planted by family and being planted through landscape redevelopement in 1980s. Korean traditional trees are planted in this area like Pinus densiflora, Juniperus chinensis L., Thuja orientalis L., Zelkova serrata Makino, Sophora japonica L., Lagerstroemia indica, Prunus mume include Ginkgo biloba which is old big tree and is registered in Jangsung-gun as protected trees. The tea tree in this area was introduced from wild tea plantation in Yonhwa moutain and was planted. From now on, we have to pay consideration a form management of planted trees in the historical area, rearrangement of plant density due to over planting, removal of alien trees like Pinus bungeana and Canna generalisa, prevention a dwarfishness of main area due to over planting in outside facilities, recovery a alienation among each planting area, and planting concept from plants drawings on wall of buildings can be suggested. The implications of this case study is that introduction of over planting can make more problems like losing sense of place. Therefore, we must do a actual state survey on traditional landscape area like Seowon from preservation point of view."
Assessing frost hardiness of Pinus bungeana shoots and needles by electrical impedance spectroscopy with and without freezing tests,"['Zhang, G', 'Li, YQ', 'Dong, SH']",JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY,10.1093/jpe/rtp023,DEC 2010,1,"Aims

Nursery and forest operations require that frost hardiness results be produced faster than can be provided by controlled freezing tests. There is a great challenge to develop a rapid method for predicting frost hardiness that might not necessitate controlled freezing tests. The aim of this study was to examine the assessment of the frost hardiness of shoots and needles of Pinus bungeana by electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with and without controlled exposure to freezing.

Methods

The frost hardiness of current-year shoots and needles of P. bungeana in an 8-year-old provenance field trial was measured at Shisanlin Nursery in Beijing, China, from September 2006 to January 2007 by means of EIS and conventional electrolyte leakage (EL). In the same plants, but without controlled freezing test, were monitored the EIS parameters in current-year shoots and needles.

Important Findings

The results showed that (i) after controlled freezing tests, the frost hardiness estimated by EIS parameters (extracellular resistance, r(e), and membrane time constant, tau(m)) was significantly correlated with the frost hardiness assessed by EL method (r = 0.95) and (ii) for the samples not exposed to controlled freezing treatment, the relaxation time tau(1) for shoots and beta for needles had greater correlations with the frost hardiness estimated by EL after controlled freezing tests relative to the other parameters (r = -0.90 for shoots and r = 0.84 for needles, respectively).

The parameters r(e) of shoots and needles and tau(m) of needles might be applied for measuring frost hardiness of samples after exposed to controlled freezing tests. The frost hardiness results can be obtained within 48 h. The parameters tau(1) of shoots and beta of needles could be used for estimating the frost hardiness of samples without using a controlled freezing test. The frost hardiness results can be obtained within 24 h."
"Molecular Characterization of a Dehydroascorbate Reductase from Pinus bungeana
","['Yang, HL', 'Zhao, YR', 'Wang, CL', 'Yang, ZL', 'Zeng, QY', 'Lu, H']",JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE PLANT BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1744-7909.2009.00848.x,NOV 2009,11,"Dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) plays a critical role in the ascorbate-glutathione recycling reaction for most higher plants. To date, studies on DHAR in higher plants have focused largely on Arabidopsis and agricultural plants, and there is virtually no information on the molecular characteristics of DHAR in gymnosperms. The present study reports the cloning and characteristics of a DHAR (PbDHAR) from a pine, Pinus bungeana Zucc. ex Endl. The PbDHAR gene encodes a protein of 215 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 24.26 kDa. The predicted 3-D structure of PbDHAR showed a typical glutathione S-transferase fold. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the PbDHAR was a constitutive expression gene in P. bungeana. The expression level of PbDHAR mRNA in P. bungeana seedlings did not show significant change under high temperature stress. The recombinant PbDHAR was overexpressed in Escherichia coli following purification with affinity chromatography. The recombinant PbDHAR exhibited enzymatic activity (19.84 mu mol/min per mg) and high affinity (a K(m) of 0.08 mM) towards the substrates dehydroascorbate (DHA). Moreover, the recombinant PbDHAR was a thermostable enzyme, and retained 77% of its initial activity at 55 degrees C. The present study is the first to provide a detailed molecular characterization of the DHAR in P. bungeana."
"Incongruence among mitochondrial, chloroplast and nuclear gene trees in Pinus subgenus Strobus (Pinaceae)","['Tsutsui, K', 'Suwa, A', 'Sawada, K', 'Kato, T', 'Ohsawa, TA', 'Watano, Y']",JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH,10.1007/s10265-009-0246-4,SEP 2009,16,"Introgression has been considered to be one of main factors leading to phylogenetic incongruence among different datasets at lower taxonomic levels. In the plants of Pinaceae, the mtDNA, cpDNA, and nuclear DNA (nrDNA) may have different evolutionary histories through introgression because they are inherited maternally, paternally and biparentally, respectively. We compared mtDNA, cpDNA, and two low-copy nrDNA phylogenetic trees in the genus Pinus subgenus Strobus, in order to detect unknown past introgression events in this group. nrDNA trees were mostly congruent with the cpDNA tree, and supported the recent sectional and subsectional classification system. In contrast, mtDNA trees split the members of sect. Quinquefoliae into two groups that were not observed in the other gene trees. The factors constituting incongruence may be divided into the following two categories: the different splits within subsect. Strobus, and the non-monophyly of subsect. Gerardianae. The former was hypothesized to have been caused by the past introgression of cpDNA, mtDNA or both between Eurasian and North American species through Beringia. The latter was likely caused by the chimeric structure of the mtDNA sequence of P. bungeana, which might have originated through past hybridization, or through a horizontal transfer event and subsequent recombination."
Nitric oxide modulates the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and actin filament organization during cell wall construction in Pinus bungeana pollen tubes,"['Wang, YH', 'Chen, T', 'Zhang, CY', 'Hao, HQ', 'Liu, P', 'Zheng, MZ', 'Baluska, F', 'Samaj, J', 'Lin, JX']",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02820.x,2009,31,"Nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in many physiological processes in plants, including pollen tube growth. Here, effects of NO on extracellular Ca2+ flux and microfilaments during cell wall construction in Pinus bungeana pollen tubes were investigated.

Extracellular Ca2+ influx, the intracellular Ca2+ gradient, patterns of actin organization, vesicle trafficking and cell wall deposition upon treatment with the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor N.-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) or the NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4, 4, 5, 5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO) were analyzed.

SNAP enhanced pollen tube growth in a dose-dependent manner, while L-NNA and cPTIO inhibited NO production and arrested pollen tube growth. Noninvasive detection and microinjection of a Ca2+ indicator revealed that SNAP promoted extracellular Ca2+ influx and increased the steepness of the tip-focused Ca2+ gradient, while cPTIO and L-NNA had the opposite effect. Fluorescence labeling indicated that SNAP, cPTIO and L-NNA altered actin organization, which subsequently affected vesicle trafficking. Finally, the configuration and/or distribution of cell wall components such as pectins and callose were significantly altered in response to L-NNA. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy confirmed the changes in the chemical composition of walls.

Our results indicate that NO affects the configuration and distribution of cell wall components in pollen tubes by altering extracellular Ca2+ influx and F-actin organization."
Integrative proteomic and cytological analysis of the effects of extracellular Ca(2+) influx on Pinus bungeana pollen tube development,"['Wu, XQ', 'Chen, T', 'Zheng, MZ', 'Chen, YM', 'Teng, NJ', 'Samaj, J', 'Baluska, F', 'Lin, JX']",JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH,10.1021/pr800241u,OCT 2008,17,"Ca(2+) is an essential ion in the control of pollen germination and tube growth. However, the control of pollen tube development by Ca(2+) signaling and its interactions with cytoskeletal components, energy-providing pathways, and cell-expansion machinery remain elusive. Here, we used nifedipine (Nif) to study Ca(2+) functions in differential protein expression and other cellular processes in Pinus bungeana pollen tube growth. Proteomics analysis indicated that 50 proteins showed differential expression with varying doses of Nif. Thirty-four of these were homologous to previously reported proteins and were classified into different functional categories closely related to tip-growth machinery. Blocking the L-type Ca(2+) channel with Nif in the pollen tube membrane induced several early alterations within a short time, including a reduction of extracellular Ca(2+) influx and a subsequently dramatic decrease in cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]), concomitant with ultrastructural abnormalities and changes in the abundance of proteins involved in energy production and signaling. Secondary alterations included actin filament depolymerization, disrupted patterns of endocytosis/exocytosis, and cell wall remodeling, along with changes in the proteins involved in these processes. These results suggested that extracellular Ca(2+) ` influx was necessary for the maintenance of the typical tip-focused [Ca(2+)] gradient in the P. bungeana pollen tube, and that reduced adenosine triphosphate production (ATP), depolymerization of the cytoskeleton, and abnormal endocytosis/exocytosis, together with enhanced rigidity of cell walls, were responsible for the growth arrest observed in pollen tubes treated with Nif."
Isolation of de-exined pollen and cytotogical studies of the pollen intines of Pinus bungeana Zucc. Ex Endl. and Picea wilsonii Mast,"['Fang, KF', 'Wang, YN', 'Yu, TQ', 'Zhang, LY', 'Baluska, F', 'Samaj, J', 'Lin, JX']",FLORA,10.1016/j.flora.2007.04.007,2008,5,"To study the cytological and biochemical characteristics of intine, pollen deprived of exine, or de-exined pollen, was isolated from the gymnosperms Pinus bungeana and Picea wilsonii. The factors influencing the isolation rate were examined. Cellulose, callose, pectin, and arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) were localized in this material using fluorescent probes, and components of the isolated intine were further analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy. The isolation protocol was repeatable and reliable. Cellulose was found to be evenly distributed on the surface of the intine, as indicated by strong calcofluor White ST (CW) fluorescence, and aniline blue staining revealed that callose was present on the intine of P. bungeana but not on that of P. wilsonii. Immunolabeling revealed that acidic pectin epitopes recognized by the monoclonal antibody JIM5 were present on the pollen intine, as well as esterified pectin recognized by the monoclonal antibody JIM7, and AGPs recognized by the LM2 antibody. Two lectin binding sites, the concanavalin agglutinin (Con A) and soybean agglutinin (SBA) binding sites, were present on the intine surface, but no wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) binding sites were detectable. These results were confirmed by FTIR analysis. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."
"Ideal World and Management at Lee-tae(李迨)'s Wolyoun-jung Byelseo in Milyang, Gyeongnam","['JIN, KIM SOO', 'Kim, Tae-soo', 'Woo-Kyung, Sim']",Journal of Korean Institute of Traditional Landscape Architecture,NA,2008,0,"This research was to inquire into an ideal world he seek after through an inquiry of Wolyoun-jung Byelseo(月淵亭 別墅) by a Wolyoun Lee-tae(李迨, 1483～1536) as a Confucian Scholar retired to hermitage in 16th century. The way of studying was to consider centering the literatures of a collection of Wolyoun' works and Wolyoun-jung(月淵亭) survey which compiled the records of friends who Lee-tae kept company with and of his descendents, and was proceeded by things like drawings, field investigation, interviews and so forth. As the result a conclusion as follows was drawn out. Lee-tae entered government service two times and quitted three times in his life. He went into government when a condition he could realize his ideal was given but when righteous government was hard to realize he wanted to retire and live a life to stroll about in nature.  The background he retired to hermitage to run Wolyoun-jung was because he was shocked by Joguangjo(趙光祖)'s death by gimyosahwa(己卯士禍, 1519) and news of his close colleagues' homecoming and discharge, which made him live with turning a blind eye to telling right from wrong about the world. In 15 years of Joongjong(1520)'s rule, the next year he predicted gimyosahwa and went down into the country, he came to run Byelseo on a hill of Wolyoun-jung where east Milyang stream and north Milyang stream are reunited together. Especially, he recognized it as a space to understand provision of the universe and said that a life to live strolling about in nature was a life by virtuous justification. When we see scenic distinctive quality of the time appearing in Milyangsibigyungdo(密陽十二景圖) known as being drawn in 1566, we can see that Wolyoun-jung was built up of 5 thatched cottages separated from the main building of a house and surrounded with a grove of bamboos. Also we can see its both sides have dae(臺) built up with rocks. For convenience' sake, its whole area can be sectioned into an outer garden of a palace and inner one. Outer one can be sectioned into spaces like jooko(竹塢), a bamboo grove, lacebark pine(Pinus bungeana) which he planted himself and hangdan(杏亶), and Jordae(垂釣臺) where he fished in, Yeongwolgan(迎月澗), Ssangchung bridge(雙淸橋), Tackjokarm(濯足巖), Wolyounygongdae(翰林李公臺), geeam(妓巖). Inner one can be sectioned Ssanggyungdang(雙鏡堂)g and Wolyoundae(月淵臺).  Ssanggyungdang was used as a living space for his rest, reading and lecture, and as a space for his friends who he kept company with to visit and stay. As Wolyoundae where was the highest place in Wolyoun-jung was a space to experience the spirit of endurance and knowledge and to complete principle of the heavens and the earth, it was used as a space for training body and spirit and at the same time a space taking a stroll to complete nature. Ssangchung bridge which connects Ssanggyungdang and Wolyoundae can be said to have a meaning as a bridge through an Ideal world. Finally, Joseon Dynasty scholars ideal world wouldn't be pursuing an admiring space for seeing a beautiful scene. To comprehend principle of nature and to fulfill the beauty of source to follow scholar's morality, scholar's proper duty, that is the royal road politics, is Joseon Dynasty scholars' purpose and at the same time Ideal world."

Though the larval body weights were in a wide spectrum among treatments, growth curves of them were very similar from each other, showing continuous increase from the early larval stage to about 3 months old. The body weight was decreased slightly after the feeding period of the early 3 months. The size of larvae and adults became the largest from P. bungeana fed larvae. The mid-sized ones were from P. koraiensis, P. densiflora and A. holophylla. Small ones came from L. leptolepsis and P. rigida. The larval growth was retarded without water supply. Overall survival rates from the early stage of a larva to a fertile adult were 53.6% from P. koraiensis; 51.8%, P. densiflora; 34.7%, A. holophylla; 17.8%, P. bungeana; 16.7%, L. leptolepsis; and 12.3%, P. rigida. Adults from larvae fed the 6 species of conifers, respectively, were grown into the reproductively potent adults, which laid viable eggs. A few of overwintered larvae did not pupate and remained still as a larva until the late October of the year. Data from the field survey, the head width emerged from P. koraiensis was larger than that of L. leptolepsis. The adult emergence hole in P. koraiensis was larger also. While, the size of the emergence hole was larger in the artificially innoculated log of P. koraiensis, which was kept for a larva to be with a minimized food competition and sufficient water supply, than that of the field."
