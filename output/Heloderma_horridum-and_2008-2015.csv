"Early Pleistocene (Blancan) Helodermatid Lizard from Arizona, USA","['Mead, JI', 'Holte, S', 'White, RS', 'McCord, R', 'XENOSAURUS']",JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY,10.1670/13-222,JUN 2015,0,"Two cranial osteoderms and a maxilla assigned to Heloderma suspectum (Squamata, Helodermatidae) were recovered from the 111 Ranch fossil locality, San Simon Valley, Graham County, southeastern Arizona. A minimum age of the deposits and fossils is approximately 2.7-2.4 million years ago, latest Blancan Land Mammal Age, spanning the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary. The presence of a pronounced deep venom grove and a tooth count of eight indicate that the maxilla belongs to Heloderma and not the closely related and extinct Lowesaurus or Eurheloderma. The highly reduced nasolacrimal fossa and the shortened projection of the maxillary lappet on the fossil agree with the condition in H. suspectum and not in Heloderma horridum. During this transition time, the locality was a mosaic grassland-woodland ecosystem with open water and riparian niches occupied with grazing and browsing mammals."
SURGICAL TREATMENT OF PULMONARY MELANOPHOROMA IN A BEADED LIZARD (HELODERMA HORRIDUM EXASPERATUM),"['Rivera, S', 'Crane, MM', 'McManamon, R', 'Gregory, CR']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,JUN 2015,0,"An adult male Rio Fuerte beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum exasperatum) was examined because of a history of anorexia and lethargy of one week duration. Diagnostic tests included a physical exam, complete blood cell count, plasma biochemistries, whole-body radiographs, and ultrasonography. The physical exam revealed the presence of a large mass in the midcoelomic cavity. Radiographs confirmed the presence of the midcoelomic mass and showed a smaller mass in the right cranial lung field. The ultrasonogram showed a homogeneous mass with soft tissue echogenicity. A fine-needle aspirate was collected, and the cytology results were suggestive of a melanophoroma. Exploratory surgery revealed a large mass (10 x 6 cm) within the right lung, with extensive adhesions to the caudolateral margin of the right liver lobe. The smaller mass (2 x 3 cm) was within the cranial aspect of the right lung. A right pulmonectomy and partial hepatectomy were performed to remove the tumors. The animal died 3.5-yr postsurgery, and histopathologic evaluation did not show evidence of melanophoroma in any of the tissues evaluated."
Characterization of the gila monster (Heloderma suspectum suspectum) venom proteome,"['Sanggaard, KW', 'Dyrlund, TF', 'Thomsen, LR', 'Nielsen, TA', 'Brondum, L', 'Wang, T', 'Thogersen, IB', 'Enghild, JJ']",JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS,10.1016/j.jprot.2015.01.004,MAR 18 2015,0,"The archetypical venomous lizard species are the helodermatids, the gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum) and the beaded lizards (Heloderma horridum). In the present study, the gila monster venom proteome was characterized using 2D-gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry-based de novo peptide sequencing followed by protein identification based on sequence homology. A total of 39 different proteins were identified out of the 58 selected spots that represent the major constituents of venom. Of these proteins, 19 have not previously been identified in helodermatid venom. The data showed that helodermatid venom is complex and that this complexity is caused by genetic isoforms and post-translational modifications including proteolytic processing. In addition, the venom proteome analysis revealed that the major constituents of the gila monster venom are kallikrein-like serine proteinases (EC 3.4.21) and phospholipase A(2) (type III) enzymes (EC 3.1.1.4). A neuroendocrine convertase 1 homolog that most likely converts the proforms of the previously identified bioactive exendins into the mature and active forms was identified suggesting that these peptide toxins are secreted as proforms that are activated by proteolytic cleavage following secretion as opposed to being activated intracellularly. The presented global protein identification-analysis provides the first overview of the helodermatid venom composition.

Biological significance

The helodermatid lizards are the classical venomous lizards, and the pharmacological potential of the venom from these species has been known for years; best illustrated by the identification of exendin-4, which is now used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Despite the potential, no global analyses of the protein components in the venom exist. A hindrance is the lack of a genome sequence because it prevents protein identification using a conventional approach where MS data are searched against predicted protein sequences based on the genome sequence. However, in the recent years the development of software tools for de novo sequencing and homology searches have improved significantly facilitating the first global analysis of the major protein components of helodermatid venom presented in this study. We have used a 2D-gel approach and determined the protein components in the 58 major spots resulting in the identification of 39 unique proteins. Of these, 19 have not previously been identified in helodermatid venom. The analysis provides results with impact on our understanding of the function and evolution of venom proteins, and serves as a basis for further unraveling of the pharmaceutical potential of the venom components.

Fossilized Venom: The Unusually Conserved Venom Profiles of Heloderma Species (Beaded Lizards and Gila Monsters),"['Koludarov, I', 'Jackson, TNW', 'Sunagar, K', 'Nouwens, A', 'Hendrikx, I', 'Fry, BG']",TOXINS,10.3390/toxins6123582,DEC 2014,0,"Research into snake venoms has revealed extensive variation at all taxonomic levels. Lizard venoms, however, have received scant research attention in general, and no studies of intraclade variation in lizard venom composition have been attempted to date. Despite their iconic status and proven usefulness in drug design and discovery, highly venomous helodermatid lizards (gila monsters and beaded lizards) have remained neglected by toxinological research. Proteomic comparisons of venoms of three helodermatid lizards in this study has unravelled an unusual similarity in venom-composition, despite the long evolutionary time (similar to 30 million years) separating H. suspectum from the other two species included in this study (H. exasperatum and H. horridum). Moreover, several genes encoding the major helodermatid toxins appeared to be extremely well-conserved under the influence of negative selection (but with these results regarded as preliminary due to the scarcity of available sequences). While the feeding ecologies of all species of helodermatid lizard are broadly similar, there are significant morphological differences between species, which impact upon relative niche occupation."
Prevalence of neutralising antibodies against adenoviruses in lizards and snakes,"['Ball, I', 'Ofner, S', 'Funk, RS', 'Griffin, C', 'Riedel, U', 'Mohring, J', 'Marschang, RE']",VETERINARY JOURNAL,10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.07.027,OCT 2014,1,"Adenoviruses (AdVs) are relatively common in lizards and snakes, and several genetically distinct AdVs have been isolated in cell culture. The aims of this study were to examine serological relationships among lizard and snake AdVs and to determine the frequency of AdV infections in these species. Isolates from a boa constrictor (Boa constrictor), a corn snake (Pantherophis gutattus) and a central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps), and two isolates from helodermatid lizards (Heloderma horridum and H. suspectum) were used in neutralisation tests for the detection of antibodies in plasma from 263 lizards from seven families (including 12 species) and from 141 snakes from four families (including 28 species) from the USA and Europe. Most lizard and snake samples had antibodies against a range of AdV isolates, indicating that AdV infection is common among these squamates. Neutralisation tests with polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits demonstrated serological cross-reactivity between both helodermatid lizard isolates. However, squamate plasma showed different reactions to each of these lizard isolates in neutralisation tests. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Molecular Characterization of a Lizard Adenovirus Reveals the First Atadenovirus with Two Fiber Genes and the First Adenovirus with Either One Short or Three Long Fibers per Penton,"['Penzes, JJ', 'Menendez-Conejero, R', 'Condezo, GN', 'Ball, I', 'Papp, T', 'Doszpoly, A', 'Paradela, A', 'Perez-Berna, AJ', 'Lopez-Sanz, M', 'Nguyen, TH', 'van Raaij, MJ', 'Marschang, RE', 'Harrach, B', 'Benko, M', 'San Martin, C']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.00306-14,OCT 2014,5,"Although adenoviruses (AdVs) have been found in a wide variety of reptiles, including numerous squamate species, turtles, and crocodiles, the number of reptilian adenovirus isolates is still scarce. The only fully sequenced reptilian adenovirus, snake adenovirus 1 (SnAdV-1), belongs to the Atadenovirus genus. Recently, two new atadenoviruses were isolated from a captive Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) and Mexican beaded lizards (Heloderma horridum). Here we report the full genomic and proteomic characterization of the latter, designated lizard adenovirus 2 (LAdV-2). The double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome of LAdV-2 is 32,965 bp long, with an average G+C content of 44.16%. The overall arrangement and gene content of the LAdV-2 genome were largely concordant with those in other atadenoviruses, except for four novel open reading frames (ORFs) at the right end of the genome. Phylogeny reconstructions and plesiomorphic traits shared with SnAdV-1 further supported the assignment of LAdV-2 to the Atadenovirus genus. Surprisingly, two fiber genes were found for the first time in an atadenovirus. After optimizing the production of LAdV-2 in cell culture, we determined the protein compositions of the virions. The two fiber genes produce two fiber proteins of different sizes that are incorporated into the viral particles. Interestingly, the two different fiber proteins assemble as either one short or three long fiber projections per vertex. Stoichiometry estimations indicate that the long fiber triplet is present at only one or two vertices per virion. Neither triple fibers nor a mixed number of fibers per vertex had previously been reported for adenoviruses or any other virus.

IMPORTANCE

Here we show that a lizard adenovirus, LAdV-2, has a penton architecture never observed before. LAdV-2 expresses two fiber proteins-one short and one long. In the virion, most vertices have one short fiber, but a few of them have three long fibers attached to the same penton base. This observation raises new intriguing questions on virus structure. How can the triple fiber attach to a pentameric vertex? What determines the number and location of each vertex type in the icosahedral particle? Since fibers are responsible for primary attachment to the host, this novel architecture also suggests a novel mode of cell entry for LAdV-2. Adenoviruses have a recognized potential in nanobiomedicine, but only a few of the more than 200 types found so far in nature have been characterized in detail. Exploring the taxonomic wealth of adenoviruses should improve our chances to successfully use them as therapeutic tools."
"Characterization of STR/microsatellite primers for the Gila monster, Heloderma suspectum screened from paired-end Illumina shotgun sequencing","['Hess, MR', 'Edwards, T', 'Edmunds, DA', 'Bonine, KE']",CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES,10.1007/s12686-013-9971-z,DEC 2013,0,"We used Illumina paired-end shotgun sequencing to characterize microsatellite loci in Heloderma suspectum. We identified over 124,000 potentially amplifiable loci and describe PCR primers for 18 variable tri- and tetra-nucleotide STRs. The observed number of alleles per locus ranged from 5 to 16 and heterozygosity varied from 0.64 to 0.92. In addition 13 of these loci cross-amplified in the beaded lizard, Heloderma horridum. This method of microsatellite identification proved extremely efficient and cost effective. This novel marker set can be used by researchers to better understand these elusive species."
Structural and Molecular Diversification of the Anguimorpha Lizard Mandibular Venom Gland System in the Arboreal Species Abronia graminea,"['Koludarov, I', 'Sunagar, K', 'Undheim, EAB', 'Jackson, TNW', 'Ruder, T', 'Whitehead, D', 'Saucedo, AC', 'Mora, GR', 'Alagon, AC', 'King, G', 'Antunes, A', 'Fry, BG']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-012-9529-9,DEC 2012,8,"In the past, toxinological research on reptiles has focused principally on clinically important species. As a result, our understanding of the evolution of the reptile venom system is limited. Here, for the first time, we describe the structural and molecular evolutionary features of the mandibular toxin-secreting gland of Abronia graminea, a representative of one of the poorly known and entirely arboreal lineages of anguimorph lizards. We show that the mandibular gland is robust and serous, characters consistent with those expected of a toxin-secreting gland in active use. A wide array of transcripts were recovered that were homologous to those encoded by the indisputably venomous helodermatid lizards. We show that some of these toxin transcripts are evolving under active selection and show evidence of rapid diversification. Helokinestatin peptides in particular are revealed to have accumulated residues that have undergone episodic diversifying selections. Conversely, the natriuretic peptides have evolved under tremendous evolutionary constraints despite being encoded in tandem with helokinestatins by the same gene precursor. Of particular note is the sequencing for the first time of kunitz peptides from a lizard toxin-secreting gland. Not only are kunitz peptides shown to be an ancestral toxicoferan toxin, the ancestral state of this peptide is revealed to be a dual domain encoding precursor. This research provides insight into the evolutionary history of the ancient toxicoferan reptile venom system. In addition, it shows that even 'clinically irrelevant' species can be a rich source of novel venom components, worthy of investigation for drug design and biomedical research."
Discovery of a Novel Glucagon-like Peptide (GCGL) and Its Receptor (GCGLR) in Chickens: Evidence for the Existence of GCGL and GCGLR Genes in Nonmammalian Vertebrates,"['Wang, YJ', 'Meng, FY', 'Zhong, Y', 'Huang, GA', 'Li, J', 'GOLDFISH CARASSIUS-AURATUS']",ENDOCRINOLOGY,10.1210/en.2012-1586,NOV 2012,10,"Glucagon (GCG), glucagon-related peptides, and their receptors have been reported to play important roles including the regulation of glucose homeostasis, gastrointestinal activity, and food intake in vertebrates. In this study, we identified genes encoding a novel glucagon-like peptide (named GCGL) and its receptor (GCGLR) from adult chicken brain using RACE and/or RT-PCR. GCGL was predicted to encode a peptide of 29 amino acids (cGCGL(1-29)), which shares high amino acid sequence identity with mammalian and chicken GCG (62-66%). GCGLR is a receptor of 430 amino acids and shares relatively high amino acid sequence identity (53-55%) with the vertebrate GCG receptor (GCGR). Using a pGL3-CRE-luciferase reporter system, we demonstrated that synthetic cGCGL(1-29), but not its structurally related peptides, i.e. exendin-4 and GCG, could potently activate GCGLR (EC50: 0.10 nM) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, indicating that GCGLR can function as a GCGL-specific receptor. RT-PCR assay revealed that GCGL expression is mainly restricted to several tissues including various brain regions, spinal cord, and testes, whereas GCGLR mRNA is widely expressed in adult chicken tissues with abundant expression noted in the pituitary, spinal cord, and various brain regions. Using synteny analysis, GCGL and GCGLR genes were also identified in the genomes of fugu, tetraodon, tilapia, medaka, coelacanth, and Xenopus tropicalis. As a whole, the discovery of GCGL and GCGLR genes in chickens and other nonmammalian vertebrates clearly indicates a previously unidentified role of GCGL-GCGLR in nonmammalian vertebrates and provides important clues to the evolutionary history of GCG and GCGL genes in vertebrates.

Predicting the potential distribution of the beaded lizard and identification of priority areas for conservation,"['Domiguez-Vega, H', 'Monroy-Vilchis, O', 'Balderas-Valdivia, CJ', 'Gienger, CM', 'Ariano-Sanchez, D', 'HERPETOFAUNA']",JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.jnc.2012.04.003,AUG 2012,10,"The beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum) is listed as a threatened species in Mexico. Scientific research has been limited to two sites within its range (Chamela and Valle Motagua) outside of these two regions there have not been adequate surveys to define range limits or measure environmental correlates for defining suitable habitat. We constructed an ensemble model (EM) for the distribution of suitable habitat for H. horridum in both Mexico and Guatemala and then used that model to identify potential areas to focus conservation. We used nine presence-only modeling methods, and selected three to generate our EM. We used the EM to evaluate the efficacy of the existing Protected Natural Areas (PNAs) in Mexico and Guatemala for H. horridum. Also we used the best individual predictive model (Maxent) to obtain the most important factors for H. horridum presence and used them to analyse the habitat use; finally we used our predictive model to calculate niche breath for the species. The estimated potential distribution of H. horridum is 370,474 km(2); within this area we identified nine zones based on continuity and natural barriers. About 1.5% of the species distribution is under protection in the PNAs. The five most important factors for the presence of this species explained 78.2% of the generated model and are related to seasonality and soil cover, and these are used selectively. This species is closely associated with tropical deciduous forests, one of the most threatened ecosystems worldwide and is inadequately protected in both Mexico and Guatemala. Our results clearly show the necessity of a protection plan for this species. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."
Helokinestatin-7 peptides from the venoms of Heloderma lizards,"['Ma, CB', 'Wang, H', 'Wu, YX', 'Zhou, M', 'Lowe, G', 'Wang, L', 'Zhang, YQ', 'Chen, TB', 'Shaw, C']",PEPTIDES,10.1016/j.peptides.2012.03.010,JUN 2012,1,"Helokinestatins 1-6 constitute a family of bradykinin antagonist peptides originally isolated from the venoms of the Gila Monster, Heloderma suspectum and the Mexican beaded lizard, Heloderma horridum. Here we report the identification, isolation and preliminary pharmacological characterization of two novel tridecapeptides, named helokinestatin-7S (FDDDSTELILEPR - 1550 Da) and helokinestatin-7H (FDDDSRKLILEPR - 1604 Da), whose primary structures were predicted from cDNAs cloned from venom libraries of respective Heloderma lizards. Computed molecular masses of putative helokinestatin-7 peptides were used as tools to locate these peptides in archived LC/MS fractions from respective venoms and sequences were confirmed by MS/MS fragmentation. A synthetic replicate of helokinestatin-7H was found to antagonize the relaxation effect of bradykinin on rat arterial smooth muscle but to have no measurable effects alone. In contrast, synthetic helokinestatin-7S was found to directly contract this preparation. Studies on related natural peptides with subtle differences in primary structure can provide the tools for structure/activity studies in pharmacological investigations directed toward unraveling the molecular basis of venom toxicity and for the evaluation of potential therapeutic leads.

The structure and function of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor and its ligands,"['Donnelly, D']",BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY,10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01687.x,MAY 2012,30,"Glucagon-like peptide-1(7-36)amide (GLP-1) is a 30-residue peptide hormone released from intestinal L cells following nutrient consumption. It potentiates the glucose-induced secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells, increases insulin expression, inhibits beta-cell apoptosis, promotes beta-cell neogenesis, reduces glucagon secretion, delays gastric emptying, promotes satiety and increases peripheral glucose disposal. These multiple effects have generated a great deal of interest in the discovery of long-lasting agonists of the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in order to treat type 2 diabetes. This review article summarizes the literature regarding the discovery of GLP-1 and its physiological functions. The structure, function and sequenceactivity relationships of the hormone and its natural analogue exendin-4 (Ex4) are reviewed in detail. The current knowledge of the structure of GLP-1R, a Family B GPCR, is summarized and discussed, before its known interactions with the principle peptide ligands are described and summarized. Finally, progress in discovering non-peptide ligands of GLP-1R is reviewed. GLP-1 is clearly an important hormone linking nutrient consumption with blood sugar control, and therefore knowledge of its structure, function and mechanism of action is of great importance."
The development of Byetta (exenatide) from the venom of the Gila monster as an anti-diabetic agent,"['Furman, BL']",TOXICON,10.1016/j.toxicon.2010.12.016,MAR 15 2012,19,"The development of Byetta (synthetic exendin-4; exenatide) as a treatment of diabetes arose from two, parallel lines of investigation. The development of the 'incretin concept' which hypothesised that hormones from the gut contributed to the insulin secretion in response to meals, led to the identification of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) as an important 'incretin' hormone. GLP-1 not only increases insulin secretion but increases beta-cell proliferation and survival, suppresses glucagon secretion, delays gastric emptying and suppresses appetite, all of these actions contributing to a potential anti-diabetic effect. However, GLP-1 has a very short half due to its rapid breakdown by dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ectopeptidases. A systematic investigation of the composition and activity of venom from the Gila monster, Heloderma suspectum, led to the isolation of a 39-amino acid peptide, designated exendin-4, showing 53% structural homology with GLP-1(7-36). Exendin-4 mimicked GLP-1 through stimulating the GLP-1 receptor. The much greater stability of exendin-4 led to its experimental and clinical evaluation as an anti-diabetic agent and its introduction to the market in 2005. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Both PLA(2) showed a molecular mass of similar to 14 kDa determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and showed a high catalytic activity (data not showed). Although homologous with mammalian or snake venom group I PLA(2)s, Anch TX-I and II is sufficiently structurally different for the question of its placement into the existing PLA(2) classification scheme to arise. In addition, Anch TX-I and despite possessing many common structural features, also differ in some important structural properties. The amino acid sequence of both PLA(2) (Anch TX-I and III) showed high amino acid sequence identity with PLA(2) Rhopilema nomadica and Bunodosoma caissarum Cnidaria and PLA(2) of group III protein isolated from the Mexican lizard Heloderma horridum horridum and Heloderma suspectum. In addition, Anch TX-I and Anch TX-II showed high amino acid sequence identity with PLA(2) from group III also showed significant overall homology to bee Apis dorsata, Bombus terrestris and Bombus pennsylvanicus and PlA(2).

The common natriuretic peptide/helokinestatin precursor of the Gila Monster, Heloderma suspectum, encodes five helokinestatins of differing primary structures. Here we report the molecular cloning of a natriuretic peptide/helokinestatin precursor cDNA from a venom-derived cDNA library of the Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum). Deduction of the primary structure of the encoded precursor protein from this cloned cDNA template revealed that it consisted of 196 amino acid residues encoding a single natriuretic peptide and five helokinestatins. While the natriuretic peptide was of identical primary structure to its Gila Monster (H. suspectum) homolog, the encoded helokinestatins were not, with this region of the common precursor displaying some significant differences to its H. suspectum homolog. The helokinestatin-encoding region contained a single copy of helokinestatin-1, 2 copies of helokinestatin-3 and single copies of 2 novel peptides, (Phe)(5)-helokinestatin-2 (VPPAFVPLVPR) and helokinestatin-6 (GPPFNPPPFVDYEPR). All predicted peptides were found in reverse phase HPLC fractions of the same venom.

Both MTDNA and intron markers clearly partitioned each species. One intron and MTDNA further subdivided H. horridum into its four recognized subspecies (H. It. alvarezi, charlesbogerti, exasperatum, and horridum). However, the two subspecies of H. suspectum (H. s. suspectum and H. s. cinctum) were undefined. A supertree approach sustained these relationships. Overall, the Helodermatidae is reaffirmed as an ancient and conserved group. Its most recent common ancestor (MRCA) was Lower Eocene [35.4 million years ago (mya)], with a similar to 25 my period of stasis before the MRCA of H. horridum diversified in Lower Miocene. Another similar to 5 my passed before H. h. exasperatum and H. h. horridum diverged, followed by similar to 1.5 my before H. h. alvarezi and H. h. charlesbogerti separated. Heloderma suspectum reflects an even longer period of stasis (similar to 30 my) before diversifying from its MRCA. Both H. suspectum (Mexico) and H. h. alvarezi also revealed evidence of historic range expansion following a recent bottleneck. Our conservation phylogenetic approach emphasizes the origin and diversification of this group, yields information on the manner by which past environmental variance may have impacted its populations and, in turn, allows us to disentangle historic from contemporary impacts that might threaten its long-term persistence. The value of helodermatid conservation resides in natural services and medicinal products, particularly venom constituents, and these are only now being realized.. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Novel Venom Proteins Produced by Differential Domain-Expression Strategies in Beaded Lizards and Gila Monsters (genus Heloderma),"['Fry, BG', 'Roelants, K', 'Winter, K', 'Hodgson, WC', 'Griesman, L', 'Kwok, HF', 'Scanlon, D', 'Karas, J', 'Shaw, C', 'Wong, L', 'Norman, JA']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msp251,FEB 2010,29,"The origin and evolution of venom proteins in helodermatid lizards were investigated by multidisciplinary techniques. Our analyses elucidated novel toxin types resultant from three unique domain-expression processes: 1) The first full-length sequences of lethal toxin isoforms (helofensins) revealed this toxin type to be constructed by an ancestral monodomain, monoproduct gene (beta-defensin) that underwent three tandem domain duplications to encode a tetradomain, monoproduct with a possible novel protein fold; 2) an ancestral monodomain gene (encoding a natriuretic peptide) was medially extended to become a pentadomain, pentaproduct through the additional encoding of four tandemly repeated proline-rich peptides (helokinestatins), with the five discrete peptides liberated from each other by posttranslational proteolysis; and 3) an ancestral multidomain, multiproduct gene belonging to the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)/glucagon family being mutated to encode for a monodomain, monoproduct (exendins) followed by duplication and diversification into two variant classes (exendins 1 and 2 and exendins 3 and 4). Bioactivity characterization of exendin and helokinestatin elucidated variable cardioactivity between isoforms within each class.

Envenomation by a wild Guatemalan Beaded Lizard Heloderma horridum charlesbogerti,"['Ariano-Sanchez, D']",CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY,10.1080/15563650701733031,2008,2,"Background. The Guatemalan Beaded Lizard (Heloderma horridum charlesbogerti) is an endemic venomous lizard that inhabits southeastern Guatemala. Published reports of bites by Beaded Lizard are scarce. This is the first case report of a bite from Heloderma horridum charlesbogerti. Case report. A 24-year-old man was bitten on the left hand by a juvenile Heloderma horridum charlesbogerti. The lizard remained attached for approximately 15 seconds. The patient experienced severe local pain, dizziness, diaphoresis, vomiting, severe paresthesia in his left hand and arm, and hypotension (70/52 mm/Hg). He was treated with intravenous ketorolac, chlorpheniramine, methylprednisolone, antibiotics, ondansentron, and normal saline. Hematology tests revealed leukocytosis (12,600/mm3). Symptoms improved and the patient was discharged from hospital 24 hours after admission. Conclusion. The case reported here shows that bites by Heloderma produce severe clinical effects shortly after the bite. Management consists of waiting for the lizard to relax its bite pressure and using pliers to open lizard's mouth and pull out the bitten extremity, a careful manual search for teeth remnants, and supportive care. In our case, severe pain, unresponsive to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics, was a major problem. Parethesias resolve quickly but pain may persist for up to 12 hours after the bite. A full recovery is expected."
Nucleoside composition of Heloderma venoms,"['Aird, SD']",COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cbpb.2008.02.012,JUN 2008,1,"Venoms of Heloderma horridum and Heloderma suspectum were analyzed for the possible presence of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. Adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, hypoxanthine, inosine, and uridine were found in mu g quantities. These amounts are much smaller than those seen in many elapid or viperine venoms, but greater and more varied than those found in crotaline venoms. While their contribution to the hypotension induced by Heloderma venoms may be minor, venom nucleosides nonetheless act in concert with kallikreins/hemorrhagins, alkaline phosphomonoesterase, 5'-nucleotidase, helodermin, helospectins, helothermine, and serotonin. The use of nucleosides as toxins is therefore a generalized squamate strategy, rather than the exclusive province of snakes. Both Heloderma venoms were found to be devoid of NADase and phosphodiesterase activities. Enzymes to release endogenous purines in the prey, are not significant components of Heloderma venoms.

"Hematology, blood chemistry, and bacteriology of the free-ranging Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum)","['Espinosa-Aviles, D', 'Salomon-Soto, VM', 'Morales-Martinez, S']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/2006-0029.1,MAR 2008,7,"Blood samples from 16 adult, wild Mexican beaded lizards were obtained for complete blood count and serum biochemical analysis. In addition, both oral and cloacal swab samples were collected and submitted for bacteriologic culture. This is the first report of hematologic and bacterial data from free-living beaded lizards. This information will serve as baseline reference values for future health assessment studies in conservation, captive breeding, and research programs."
Helokinestatin: A new bradykinin B-2 receptor antagonist decapeptide from lizard venom,"['Kwok, HF', 'Chen, T', ""O'Rourke, M"", 'Ivanyi, C', 'Hirst, D', 'Shaw, C']",PEPTIDES,10.1016/j.peptides.2007.10.025,JAN 2008,9,"Synthetic bradykinin antagonist peptides/peptoids have been powerful tools for delineating the roles of kinins in both normal physiology and in pathological states. Here, we report the identification of a novel, naturally occurring bradykinin B-2 receptor antagonist peptide, helokinestatin, isolated and structurally characterized from the venoms of helodermatid lizards-the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) and the Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum). The primary structure of the peptide was established by a combination of microsequencing and mass spectroscopy as Gly-Pro-Pro-Tyr-Gln-Pro-Leu-Val-Pro-Arg (M-r 1122.62). A synthetic replicate of helokinestatin was found to inhibit bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation of phenylephrine pre-constricted rat tail artery smooth muscle, mediated by the B-2 receptor sub-type, in a dose-dependent manner. Natural selection, that generates functional optimization of predatory reptile venom peptides, can potentially provide new insights for drug lead design or for normal physiological or pathophysiological processes.
