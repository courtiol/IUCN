"Importance, cause and effect of bushmeat hunting in the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania: Implications for community based wildlife management","['Nielsen, MR']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2005.10.017,APR 2006,42,"Community Based Wildlife Management (CBWM) has been suggested as a conservation strategy in response to bushmeat hunting in the Udzungwa Mountains within the Eastern Afromontane biodiversity hotspot. The feasibility of CBWM based on meat cropping was therefore evaluated in New Dabaga/Ulangambi Forest Reserve (NDUFR). Comparison of relative wildlife densities with West Kilombero Scarp Forest Reserve, which is subject to only low hunting pressure, indicate that most relevant populations are severely depleted (Cephalophus monticola, C. harueyi and C. spadix, Potamochoerus larvatus) and hence that sustainable harvesting currently is not possible in NDUFR. Records of catch from hunters in the villages surrounding NDUFR indicate that bushmeat is of relatively low importance in terms of use and contribution to protein intake. Proximity to NDUFR and secondarily population size in the different villages is positively correlated with hunting intensity and depletion of wildlife. Comparisons between hunters and non-hunters in terms of wealth measures show that hunting is linked to poverty and low protein intake. An estimation of maximum sustainable harvest in NDUFR reveals that CBWM only has limited capacity to reduce these causes of hunting, maintain the communities' interest and offset the opportunity costs of conservation. Results of this study suggest that conservation efforts in NDUFR should focus on protecting wildlife against exploitation instead of encouraging use and dependence through CBWM. Supporting efforts should attempt to facilitate a complete shift to domestic sources of meat, by increasing the number of domestic animals in the poorest part of the population.

"Notes on Abbott's duiker (Cephalophus spadix True 1890) and other forest antelopes of Mwanihana Forest, Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania, as revealed by camera-trapping and direct observations","['Rovero, F', 'Jones, T', 'Sanderson, J']",TROPICAL ZOOLOGY,NA,JUL 2005,18,"The Udzungwa Mountains of south-central Tanzania are part of an internationally outstanding area for biodiversity. This is reflected in the mammalian fauna and particularly in the forest antelopes: at least five species co-exist, including the Tanzanian endemic Abbott's duiker (Cephalophus spadix True 1890). Information on forest antelopes from Mwanihana Forest, one of the largest forest blocks within the Udzungwa Mountains, was collected by means of camera-traps and field observations. Eighty photographs of four antelope species were collected during 197 trap-days from four camera-trap sites. Seventy-one sightings were recorded during systematic counts and random survey walks for a total of 150 days of fieldwork. Results include the first photographs in the wild of Abbott's duiker, with one individual caught while holding what appears to be a frog in its mouth. The most photographed and sighted species was the Harvey's duiker (Cephalophus natalensis harveyi Thomas 1893), followed by the suni (Neotragus moschatus von Dueben 1846). Least photographed were Abbott's duiker and bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus Pallas 1766). The study shows the usefulness and potential of camera-traps to collect information on the presence, relative abundance and babits of antelopes in densely forested areas."
"Conservation priorities for the forests of the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania, based on primates, duikers and birds","['Dinesen, L', 'Lehmberg, T', 'Rahner, MC', 'Fjeldsa, J']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00218-4,JUN 2001,40,"Results are presented from 14 surveys in the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania. Forest fragments are ranked by occurrence of key species of primates, duikers and birds. Taken together, the West Kilombero Scarp forests, Mwanihana and Udzungwa Scarp have presumably viable populations of four Udzungwa endemics with the following total population estimates: Udzungwa colobus (Procolobus badius gordonorum 15,400), Sanje mangabey (Cercocebus galeritus sanjei 1350), Udzungwa forest partridge (Xenoperdix udzungwensis 3700) and rufous-winged sunbird (Nectarinia rufipennis 6850). The mountains are also strongholds for Swynnerton's robin (Swynnertonia swynnertoni), Iringa akalat (Sheppardia lowei), dapple-throat (Arcanator orostruthus), white-winged apalis (Apalis chariessa), Usambara weaver (Ploceus nicolli), and for Abbott's duiker (Cephalophus spadix). Appropriate village based conservation measures need to address questions about sustainable forest use, hunting and possibilities for forest regeneration in large tracts of fire-maintained grasslands.
