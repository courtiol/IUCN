The role of Pleistocene refugia and rivers in shaping gorilla genetic diversity in central Africa,"['Anthony, NM', 'Johnson-Bawe, M', 'Jeffery, K', 'Clifford, SL', 'Abernethy, KA', 'Tutin, CE', 'Lahm, SA', 'White, LJT', 'Utley, JF', 'Wickings, EJ', 'Bruford, MW']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0704816105,DEC 18 2007,88,"The role of Pleistocene forest refugia and rivers in the evolutionary diversification of tropical biota has been the subject of considerable debate. A range-wide analysis of gorilla mitochondrial and nuclear variation was used to test the potential role of both refugia and rivers in shaping genetic diversity in current populations. Results reveal strong patterns of regional differentiation that are consistent with refugial hypotheses for central Africa. Four major mitochondrial haplogroups are evident with the greatest divergence between eastern (A, B) and western (C, D) gorillas. Coalescent simulations reject a model of recent east-west separation during the last glacial maximum but are consistent with a divergence time within the Pleistocene. Microsatellite data also support a similar regional pattern of population genetic structure. Signatures of demographic expansion were detected in eastern lowland (B) and Gabon/Congo (D3) mitochondrial haplogroups and are consistent with a history of postglacial expansion from formerly isolated refugia. Although most mitochondrial haplogroups are regionally defined, limited admixture is evident between neighboring haplogroups. Mantel tests reveal a significant isolation-by-distance effect among western lowland gorilla populations. However, mitochondrial genetic distances also correlate with the distance required to circumnavigate intervening rivers, indicating a possible role for rivers in partitioning gorilla genetic diversity. Comparative data are needed to evaluate the importance of both mechanisms of vicariance in other African rainforest taxa."
Habituation of western gorillas: The process and factors that influence it,"['Doran-Sheehy, DM', 'Derby, AM', 'Greer, D', 'Mongo, P']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20442,DEC 2007,19,"Habituation of western gorillas to human presence is generally an expensive, lengthy and difficult process. Here we describe the habituation process for two groups of western gorillas at the Mondika Research Center, with the hope that the lessons we learned will facilitate future gorilla studies. We expand upon earlier studies by describing the process through complete habituation for both males and females, and for more than one group. The major obstacle to habituation was developing sufficient tracking skills to follow gorilla trail on a daily basis. Once this was achieved, the silverback became semi-habituated (i.e. ignoring human presence during half of contacts) within a year, although the majority of group females continued to avoid humans. As female presence at contacts increased, a period of male recidivism followed, requiring an additional year before his complete habituation was reached. Habituating the females took longer than the male, but we found, contrary to earlier studies, that it consisted of the same stages, including avoidance, aggression, and curiosity before habituation. We compare results between groups and across sites and discuss how factors such as tracking abilities, group size and cohesion, population density and home range overlap, and the manner of approaching gorillas during contacts influence the habituation process."
"Interspecific and temporal variation of ant species within Acacia drepanolobium ant domatia, a staple food of patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas) in Laikipia, Kenya","['Isbell, LA', 'Young, TP']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20444,DEC 2007,14,"The ants that live in the swollen thorns (domatia) of Acacia drepanolobium are staple foods for patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas). To obtain a better understanding of these insects as resources for patas monkeys, we sampled the contents of 1,051 swollen thorns (ant domatia) over a 22-month period from December 1999 to September 2001, in Laikipia, Kenya. First, we confirmed that of the four species of ants that live on A. drepanolobium, Crematogaster sjostedti, the competitively dominant ant in this system, does not rear significant brood in the swollen thorns and is therefore not a major food item of patas monkeys. Second, across the other three species that do use swollen thorns for rearing their brood, C. nigriceps, C. mimosae, and Tetraponera penzigi, the number of worker ants per swollen thorn increased with increasing competitive dominance. Third, although there was considerable month-to-month variation in the number of workers, immatures, and especially alates (winged reproductives) within species, there was less variation across species because ant production was asynchronous. Variation in domatia contents was poorly related to rainfall for each of the three species. Finally, distal thorns held more alates and fewer workers than interior thorns, and branches higher off the ground held more alates and more workers than lower branches. For the numerically dominant C. mimosae, higher branches held significantly more immature ants than did lower branches. Ants are reliable food resources for patas monkeys, and are probably more reliable than many plant resources in this highly seasonal environment. We estimate that patas monkeys may get as much as a third of their daily caloric needs from these ants year-round. As ants and other insects are widely consumed by primates, we suggest that greater consideration be given to species differences in animal food choices and that further studies be conducted to examine the degree to which ants influence energy intake and reproduction in other primates."
Manipulating decay time for efficient large-mammal density estimation: gorillas and dung height,"['Kuehl, HS', 'Todd, A', 'Boesch, C', 'Walsh, PD']",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,10.1890/06-0934.1,DEC 2007,12,"Large-mammal surveys often rely on indirect signs such as dung or nests. Sign density is usually translated into animal density using sign production and decay rates. In principle, such auxiliary variable estimates should be made in a spatially unbiased manner. However, traditional decay rate estimation methods entail following many signs from production to disappearance, which, in large study areas, requires extensive travel effort. Consequently, decay rate estimates have tended to be made instead at some convenient but unrepresentative location. In this study we evaluated how much bias might be induced by extrapolating decay rates from unrepresentative locations, how much effort would be required to implement current methods in a spatially unbiased manner, and what alternate approaches might be used to improve precision. To evaluate the extent of bias induced by unrepresentative sampling, we collected data on gorilla dung at several central African sites. Variation in gorilla dung decay rate was enormous, varying by up to an order of magnitude within and between survey zones. We then estimated what the effort-precision relationship would be for a previously suggested ""retrospective'' decay rate (RDR) method, if it were implemented in a spatially unbiased manner. We also evaluated precision for a marked sign count (MSC) approach that does not use a decay rate. Because they require repeat visits to remote locations, both RDR and MSC require enormous effort levels in order to gain precise density estimates. Finally, we examined an objective criterion for decay (i.e.,dung height). This showed great potential for improving RDR efficiency because choosing a high threshold height for decay reduces decay time and, consequently, the number of visits that need to be made to remote areas. The ability to adjust decay time using an objective decay criterion also opens up the potential for a ""prospective'' decay rate (PDR) approach. Further research is necessary to evaluate whether the temporal bias inherent in such an approach is small enough to ignore, given the 10 -20-fold increases in precision promised by a PDR approach."
Effects of ecology on the gastrointestinal parasites of Alouatta pigra,"['Vitazkova, SK', 'Wade, SE']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-007-9229-2,DEC 2007,20,"We examined the effects of demographic and ecological variables on the prevalence of intestinal parasites in free-ranging black howlers, Alouatta pigra, from Belize and Mexico. We collected 253 fecal samples from 50 individually identified monkeys during 2003. We processed all samples via standard centrifugation concentration techniques with sugar and zinc sulfate as flotation media. We used antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to detect protozoa. We analyzed data for each season separately. The most important factor in predicting whether an Alouatta pigra would be infected with a parasite was its membership in a particular social troop. It was not possible to isolate the effects of human presence, forest fragmentation, primate density, and the absence of Ateles geoffroyi on the prevalence of parasites in Alouatta pigra because the factors covaried. We detected few species of gastrointestinal parasites, possibly due to Alouatta pigra's arboreal and herbivorous lifestyle and small geographic range. The prevalence of each parasite had a different pattern, with Controrchis sp. (presumed to be C. biliophilus), a fluke, tending to be more prevalent in Alouatta pigra that inhabited disturbed habitats, and Trypanoxyuris minutus, a pinworm, tending to be more prevalent in primates from undisturbed habitats. Giardia sp. tended to be more prevalent in primates at high densities. These results indicated that it is important to examine each parasite's infection pattern separately to obtain a more accurate representation of the dynamics among the host, parasites, and ecology."
Genetic diversity and phylogeographic clustering of SIVcpzPtt in wild chimpanzees in Cameroon,"['Van Heuverswyn, F', 'Li, Y', 'Bailes, E', 'Neel, C', 'Lafay, B', 'Keele, BF', 'Shaw, KS', 'Takehisa, J', 'Kraus, MH', 'Loul, S', 'Butel, C', 'Liegeois, F', 'Yangda, B', 'Sharp, PM', 'Mpoudi-Ngole, E', 'Delaporte, E', 'Hahn, BH', 'Peeters, M']",VIROLOGY,10.1016/j.virol.2007.06.018,NOV 10 2007,64,"It is now well established that the clade of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting west central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) comprises the progenitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In this study, we have greatly expanded our previous molecular epidemiological survey of SIVcpz in wild chimpanzees in Cameroon. The new results confirm a wide but uneven distribution of SIVcpzPtt in P. t. troglodytes throughout southern Cameroon and indicate the absence of SIVcpz infection in Pan troglodytes vellerosus. Analyzing 725 fecal samples from 15 field sites, we obtained partial nucleotide sequences from 16 new SlVcpzPtt strains and determined full-length sequences for two of these. Phylogenetic analyses of these new viruses confirmed the previously reported phylogeographic clustering of SIVcpzPtt lineages, with viruses related to the ancestors of HIV-1 groups M and N circulating exclusively in southeastern and south central P. t. troglodytes communities, respectively. Importantly, the SIVcpzPtt strains from the southeastern corner of Cameroon represent a relatively isolated clade indicating a defined geographic origin of the chimpanzee precursor of HIV-1 group M. Since contacts between humans and apes continue, the possibility of ongoing transmissions of SIV from chimpanzees (or gorillas) to humans has to be considered. In this context, our finding of distinct SIVcpzPtt envelope V3 sequence clades suggests that these peptides may be useful for the serological differentiation of SIVcpzPtt and HIV-1 infections, and thus the diagnosis of new cross-species transmissions if they occurred.

Using photogrammetry and color scoring to assess sexual dimorphism in wild Western Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla),"['Breuer, T', 'Robbins, MM', 'Boesch, C']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20678,NOV 2007,25,"Investigating sexual dimorphism is important for our understanding of its influence on reproductive strategies including male-male competition, mate choice, and sexual conflict. Measuring physical traits in wild animals can be logistically challenging and disruptive for the animals. Therefore body size and ornament variation in wild primates have rarely been quantified. Gorillas are amongst the most sexually dimorphic and dichromatic primates. Adult males (silverbacks) possess a prominent sagittal crest, a pad of fibrous and fatty tissue on top of the head, have red crest coloration, their saddle appears silver, and they possess a silverline along their stomach. Here we measure levels of sexual dimorphism and within male variation of body length, head size, and sexual dichromatism in a population of wild western gorillas using photogrammetry. Digital photogrammetry is a useful and precise method to measure sexual dimorphism in physical traits yielding sexual dimorphism indices (ISD), similar to those derived from traditional measurements of skeletal remains. Silverbacks were on an average 1.23 times longer in body length than adult females. Sexual dimorphism of head size was highest in measures of crest size (max ISD: 60.4) compared with measures of facial height (max ISD: 24.7). The most sexually dimorphic head size measures also showed the highest within-sex variation. We found no clear sex differences in crest coloration but there was large sexual dichromatism with high within male variation in saddle coloration and silverline size. Further studies should examine if these sexually dimorphic traits are honest signals of competitive ability and confer an advantage in reproductive success."
Tool use during display behavior in wild Cross River gorillas,"['Wittiger, L', 'Sunderland-Groves, JL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20436,NOV 2007,10,"During the course of a 3-year ecological study on Cross River gorillas (Gorilla gorilla diehli) at the Kagwene Mountain in Cameroon, we observed three cases of tool use which may be unique to the gorillas of this region and possibly learned through interactions with humans. A non-habituated group of Cross River gorillas threw fistfuls of grass toward humans in display contexts. An individual gorilla was also observed to throw a detached branch toward researchers during another encounter. The third encounter occurred between the focal group and a local man, in which the man threw stones at the gorillas and they reacted by throwing fistfuls of grass back at him. We describe these observations and speculate that this sub-population of gorillas developed this display behavior as a response to particular local conditions."
Hominoid lineage specific amplification of low-copy repeats on 22q11.2 (LCR22s) associated with velo-cardio-facial/digeorge syndrome,"['Babcock, M', 'Yatsenko, S', 'Hopkins, J', 'Brenton, M', 'Cao, Q', 'de Jong, P', 'Stankiewicz, P', 'Lupski, JR', 'Sikela, JM', 'Morrow, BE']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/ddm197,NOV 2007,17,"Segmental duplications or low-copy repeats (LCRs) constitute similar to 5% of the sequenced portion of the human genome and are associated with many human congenital anomaly disorders. The low-copy repeats on chromosome 22q11.2 ( LCR22s) mediate chromosomal rearrangements resulting in deletions, duplications and translocations. The evolutionary mechanisms leading to LCR22 formation is unknown. Four genes, USP18, BCR, GGTLA and GGT, map adjacent to the LCR22s and pseudogene copies are located within them. It has been hypothesized that gene duplication occurred during primate evolution, followed by recombination events, forming pseudogene copies. We investigated whether gene duplication could be detected in non-human hominoid species. FISH mapping was performed using probes to the four functional gene loci. There was evidence for a single copy in humans but additional copies in hominoid species. We then compared LCR22 copy number using LCR22 FISH probes. Lineage specific LCR22 variation was detected in the hominoid species supporting the hypothesis. To independently validate initial findings, real time PCR, and screening of gorilla BAC library filters were performed. This was compared to array comparative genome hybridization data available. The most striking finding was a dramatic amplification of LCR22s in the gorilla. The LCR22s localized to the telomeric or subtelomeric bands of gorilla chromosomes. The most parsimonious explanation is that the LCR22s became amplified by inter-chromosomal recombination between telomeric bands. In summary, our results are consistent with a lineage specific coupling between gene and LCR22 duplication events. The LCR22s thus serve as an important model for evolution of genome variation."
Phylogenetic diversity and the conservation biogeography of African primates,"['McGoogan, K', 'Kivell, T', 'Hutchison, M', 'Young, H', 'Blanchard, S', 'Keeth, M', 'Lehman, SM']",JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01759.x,NOV 2007,11,"Aim Phylogenetics has an important role in conservation biogeography. However, there are few data on the phylogenetic diversity of African primates. The phylogenetic diversity (PD) of a species is a measure of its taxonomic distinctness and can be estimated by looking at the phylogenetic relationships among taxa. Species-specific metrics on PD can then be used to determine conservation priorities at various biogeographical scales. We used PD metrics to rank 55 African primate species according to their conservation priorities at the country level and within six African biogeographical regions. We also addressed the following question: are there differences in conservation rankings between the IUCN Red List and our PD metrics?

Location Africa.

Methods We created a consensus phylogeny for all African primate clades based on genetic studies. Analyses of species distributions were determined using presence/absence scores at two levels: country and biogeographical region. A node-based method that standardizes for widespread taxa and endemicity was used to calculate PD indices. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to convert one of the standardized, phylogenetic indices into three clusters that could be ranked and compared with the main IUCN conservation rankings of endangered, vulnerable, and lower risk.

Results At the country and region levels, the top-priority species in terms of PD are Pan paniscus, Macaca sylvanus, Arctocebus calabarensis, Gorilla beringei, Arctocebus aureus, Allenopithecus nigroviridis, Gorilla gorilla, Procolobus verus, Cercopithecus solatus, Cercocebus galeritus, Colobus angolensis, Theropithecus gelada, Galagoides zanzibaricus, Galagoides granti, and Procolobus (Piliocolobus) badius. Geographic rankings were highest for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (country level) and Central Africa (region level). Although there were no overall differences between IUCN conservation ranks and the PD rankings, there were significant differences between the two systems for vulnerable and endangered primate taxa.

Main conclusions There are few ecological and behavioural data on populations of some of the African primates that represent the highest levels of phylogenetic diversity. Studies of primate taxa with high PD rankings should focus on identifying sites suitable for intensive studies of population densities, feeding ecology, and reproductive behaviour. We suggest that PD metrics can serve as an important, complementary data set in the IUCN ranking system for primates."
Nutritional composition of the diet of the gorilla (Gorilla beringei): a comparison between two montane habitats,"['Rothman, JM', 'Plumptre, AJ', 'Dierenfeld, ES', 'Pell, AN']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,10.1017/S0266467407004555,NOV 2007,36,"The mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) lives in two geographically separated populations, Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda and in three national parks spanning the Virunga mountain region in Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda. The altitude, climate and plant composition of these habitats differ. Our goal was to compare the diets of gorillas living in each of these habitats. The nutrients in staple foods and in the diets of individuals in a group of gorillas in Bwindi (N = 12 individuals) and a group in the Virungas (N = 7 individuals) were compared to determine if differences in dietary composition affected concentrations of nutrients in their diets. At both sites gorilla diets consisted primarily of herbaceous leaves, but the diet of Bwindi gorillas contained more tree leaves, fruit, pith and dry wood, and fewer stems. Despite differences in habitat and dietary composition, the nutrient concentrations in both gorilla diets were remarkably similar. On a dry matter basis, the diets and staple foods of Bwindi and Virunga gorillas contained similar concentrations of crude protein (CP), fibre (NDF) and non-structural carbohydrates (TNC). Bwindi gorillas ate diets containing 18%, CP, 430% NDF and 19% TNC on a dry-matter basis, while the diets of the Virunga gorillas contained 17% CP, 41% NDF and 181% TNC. Our results demonstrate that gorillas consume diets that differ by plant species and part, but contain similar concentrations of nutrients. This suggests that classifying animals by broad dietary strategy (e.g. frugivory and folivory) does not provide a reliable indicator of the nutritional quality of their diet, and that our previous assumptions about these categories should be re-evaluated."
Comparative ocular anatomy of the western lowland gorilla,"['Knapp, S', 'McCulley, JP', 'Alvarado, TP', 'Hogan, RN']",VETERINARY OPHTHALMOLOGY,10.1111/j.1463-5224.2007.00568.x,NOV-DEC 2007,4,"Objective To examine the lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) eye and determine similarities to and differences between the mountain gorilla (Gorilla gorilla, beringei) and the human eye. In addition, we compare our findings of G. g. gorilla to previous reports on the eye of this subspecies.

Procedures A 13-year-old deceased male lowland gorilla and a 34-year-old deceased female lowland gorilla were included in the study. Gross and microscopic examinations of the formalin-fixed right eyeball of each gorilla were carried out.

Results Globe dimensions of G. g. gorilla were similar to G. g. beringei and to humans. The limbal conjunctival epithelium and the choroid were densely pigmented. However, the distribution of the conjunctival pigment ring was different to that of G. g. beringei and the melanocytes of the choroid were unusually round. There were deep crypts in the anterior border layer of the iris, and the epithelium of the pars plana was uniquely irregular. Vertical corneal diameter was observed to be equal or greater than horizontal diameter in G. g. gorilla, which is in contrast to humans and to previous findings for G. g. beringei. Corneal thickness was closer to that of humans than to G. g. beringei. Posterior lens capsule thickness was noticeably greater than that of humans.

Conclusions Although some variation between the ocular anatomy of G. g. gorilla and G. g. beringei does exist, the gross and microscopic findings closely resemble each other in these two subspecies. In addition, the eye of Gorilla appears remarkably similar to the human eye. However, comparison of measurements with those in humans is somewhat limited because formalin-fixation can introduce tissue shrinkage and artifact."

Functional evidence for differences in sperm competition in humans and chimpanzees,"['Anderson, MJ', 'Chapman, SJ', 'Videan, EN', 'Evans, E', 'Fritz, J', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Dixson, AF', 'Gagneux, P']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20674,OCT 2007,20,"more males compete for opportunities to fertilize a given set of ova. Previous studies have demonstrated that certain morphological characteristics are affected by sperm competition intensity (e.g. relative testes size and sperm midpiece volume). This study examined whether aspects of sperm energetics may also be affected by sexual selection. We compared the membrane potential of mitochondria in live sperm between H. sapiens (single partner mating system) and R troglodytes (multiple partner mating system). Flow cytometry of sperm stained with the carbocyanine fluorescent dye JC-1 (an assay for mitochondrial membrane potential) revealed marked differences in red fluorescence intensity. R troglodytes sperm showed significantly higher mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitochondria provide a substantial part of the energy required for sperm motility. A higher mitochondrial loading may therefore be associated with enhanced sperm motility and/or longevity. Additionally, examination of JC-1 red fluorescence levels before and after in vitro capacitation revealed further differences. Whereas chimpanzee sperm showed maintenance of membrane potential after capacitation (in some cases even an increase), sperm from humans consistently showed reduction in membrane potential. These results indicate that the sperm of human beings and chimpanzees exhibit marked differences in mitochondrial function, which are affected by selection pressures relating to sperm competition and that these pressures differ significantly between humans and chimpanzees."
Dog-logic: inferential reasoning in a two-way choice task and its restricted use,"['Erdohegyi, A', 'Topal, J', 'Viranyi, Z', 'Miklosi, A']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.03.004,OCT 2007,59,"Three experiments were designed to test whether adult pet dogs are able to show inferential reasoning when searching for their toy in a series of two-way choice tasks. The experimenter placed a toy under one of two identical containers and then provided some information by manipulating the covers: either both containers were lifted or just the empty or baited one. There were other trials when the experimenter not only revealed the corresponding container but manipulated also the other one without showing its content. In the second experiment the same conditions were used except that the content of the containers was revealed by strings without any human manipulation. Results of the two studies show that dogs are able to use inferential reasoning by exclusion (i.e. they can find the hidden toy if they have seen where the toy was missing). However, dogs were able to solve the reasoning task only when they could not rely on social-communicative cues ( directional gesture and gaze cues) or could not use any other simple discriminative stimuli ( movement of a container) for making decisions. This suggests that dogs are often prevented from showing reasoning abilities by pre-existing biases for social or movement cues. Results of the third experiment also support the primary importance of social cueing because in another object-choice task, individuals preferred to choose the 'socially marked' container ( touching, gaze alternation) to the remotely moved one when they had no visual information about the location of the toy."
Mental representation of symbols as revealed by vocabulary errors in two bonobos (Pan paniscus),"['Lyn, H']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-007-0086-3,OCT 2007,9,"Error analysis has been used in humans to detect implicit representations and categories in language use. The present study utilizes the same technique to report on mental representations and categories in symbol use from two bonobos (Pan paniscus). These bonobos have been shown in published reports to comprehend English at the level of a two-and-a-half year old child and to use a keyboard with over 200 visuographic symbols (lexigrams). In this study, vocabulary test errors from over 10 years of data revealed auditory, visual, and spatio-temporal generalizations (errors were more likely items that looked like sounded like, or were frequently associated with the sample item in space or in time), as well as hierarchical and conceptual categorizations. These error data, like those of humans, are a result of spontaneous responding rather than specific training and do not solely depend upon the sample mode (e.g. auditory similarity errors are not universally more frequent with an English sample, nor were visual similarity errors universally more frequent with a photograph sample). However, unlike humans, these bonobos do not make errors based on syntactical confusions (e.g. confusing semantically unrelated nouns), suggesting that they may not separate syntactical and semantic information. These data suggest that apes spontaneously create a complex, hierarchical, web of representations when exposed to a symbol system."
Apes know that hidden objects can affect the orientation of other objects,"['Call, J']",COGNITION,10.1016/j.cognition.2006.08.004,OCT 2007,19,"Four bonobos, seven gorillas, and six orangutans were presented with two small rectangular boards on a platform. One of the boards had a piece of food under it so that it acquired an inclined orientation whereas the other remained flat on the platform. Subjects preferentially selected the inclined board. In another experiment, subjects were initially presented with two inclined boards and a transformation took place in which one of the boards fell flat to the platform while the other remained inclined. Subjects also preferred the board that remained inclined. Two additional experiments highlighted some of the possible limitations of their reasoning in this task. Presented with two inclined boards, one of which was visibly supported by a piece of wood, they failed to systematically select the unsupported one whose only reason for being inclined was the presence of the reward. Another experiment presented two rewards in each trial (instead of the customary one) in one of the following two combinations: large banana vs. small carrot or small banana vs. large carrot. Prior to the test, E presented both rewards to the subject and then hid each of them under one of the boards so that both boards were differentially inclined due to the different sizes of the rewards involved. Although subjects selected the board that showed a greater inclination (thus securing the larger reward), they disregarded the type of food that was involved. This often meant that they chose the large carrot over the small banana even though they reversed such a choice when the rewards were not occluded by the boards. Providing subjects with a 'reminder' of the type of reward hidden under the boards did not alter the original results. There was no evidence of learning throughout the various experiments and control tests ruled out the possibility of inadvertent cuing by the experimenter, poor performance due to a lack of motivation, or good performance due to a predisposition to select objects with sloped surfaces. It is concluded that subjects made some inferences about the reason for the inclined orientation of the boards, and not simply associated an inclined orientation with the presence of the reward.

A new approach to estimate parameters of speciation models with application to apes,"['Becquet, C', 'Przeworski, M']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.6409707,OCT 2007,153,"How populations diverge and give rise to distinct species remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology, with important implications for a wide range of fields, from conservation genetics to human evolution. A promising approach is to estimate parameters of simple speciation models using polymorphism data from multiple loci. Existing methods, however, make a number of assumptions that severely limit their applicability, notably, no gene flow after the populations split and no intralocus recombination. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate parameters of an isolation- migration model. The approach uses summaries of polymorphism data at multiple loci surveyed in a pair of diverging populations or closely related species and, importantly, allows for intralocus recombination. To illustrate its potential, we applied it to extensive polymorphism data from populations and species of apes, whose demographic histories are largely unknown. The isolation- migration model appears to provide a reasonable fit to the data. It suggests that the two chimpanzee species became reproductively isolated in allopatry similar to 850 Kya, while Western and Central chimpanzee populations split similar to 440 Kya but continued to exchange migrants. Similarly, Eastern and Western gorillas and Sumatran and Bornean orangutans appear to have experienced gene flow since their splits similar to 90 and over 250 Kya, respectively."
Spatial memory of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) for hidden objects in a detour task,"['Fiset, S', 'Beaulieu, C', 'LeBlanc, V', 'Dube, L']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-ANIMAL BEHAVIOR PROCESSES,10.1037/0097-7403.33.4.497,OCT 2007,7,"Spatial memory of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) for hidden objects was investigated via a visible displacement problem of object permanence with a detour paradigm. Experiment 1 showed that dogs were able to spontaneously locate a disappearing object in a detour situation. In Experiments 2 and 3, dead reckoning and allocentric spatial information were put in conflict. Results revealed that dogs simultaneously encoded both sources of information when they had to bypass an obstacle to locate a hidden object. Experiment 3 also revealed that, over the course of testing, dogs gradually learned to rely predominantly on allocentric cues when the detour involved several reorientations. The current study reveals that spatial memory of dogs for hidden objects in a detour task was guided by flexibility in processing spatial information. Dogs could simultaneously encode dead reckoning and allocentric information to locate a disappearing object and used them hierarchically according to the complexity of the detour they encountered in the environment."
Inactivation of MOXD2 and S100A15A by Exon deletion during human evolution,"['Hahn, Y', 'Jeong, S', 'Lee, B']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msm146,OCT 2007,15,"We devised a bioinformatics method for systematic identification of putative human-specific exon-deletion mutations that occurred after the divergence of human and chimpanzee and experimentally verified 2 of the predicted mutations in MOXD2 and S100A15A genes. MOXD2 gene encodes a monooxygenase that is highly conserved in mammals and is mostly expressed in the olfactory epithelium in mouse. The presence of a deletion of the last 2 exons and a polymorphic nonsense mutation in exon 6 suggests that MOXD2 gene is inactive in humans. S100A15A is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, the mouse ortholog of which is expressed during epidermal maturation. Human S100A15A gene is likely to be inactive because the start codon-bearing exon is deleted in human. We propose that modification or inactivation of MOXD2 and S100A15A genes have contributed to the loss of certain smell sense in humans and to the development of human skin."

Five separate groups of bonobo Pan paniscus were located in the areas of Bolombo-Losombo, Mbala-Donkese, Ngombe-Botuali, Botuali-Ilombe, and Mompulenge-Mbanzi-Malebo-Nguomi, and one population of chimpanzees Pan troglodytes in the Bosobele-Lubengo area. Mean bonobo densities ranged from 0.27 individuals km(-2) in the vicinity of Lake Tumba to 2.2 individuals km(-2) in the Malebo-Nguomi area. In the latter they appear to be living at a higher density than reported for any other site. This may be due to the area's forest-savannah mosaic habitat, which may provide year-round fruit sources, with bonobos falling back on savannah fruits when forest resources are scarce. The bonobos of the Bolombo-Losombo area and the Bosobele-Lubengo chimpanzees have low relative abundances and live in marginal habitats of islands of terra firma within inundated forests."
Maintenance of imprinting and nuclear architecture in cycling cells,"['Teller, K', 'Solovei, I', 'Buiting, K', 'Horsthemke, B', 'Cremer, T']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0704285104,SEP 18 2007,29,"Dynamic gene repositioning has emerged as an additional level of epigenetic gene regulation. An early example was the report of a transient, spatial convergence (<= 2 mu m) of oppositely imprinted regions (""kissing""), including the Angelman syndrome/Prader-Willi syndrome (AS/PWS) locus and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome locus in human lymphocytes during late S phase. It was argued that kissing is required for maintaining opposite imprints in cycling cells. Employing 3D-FISH with a BAC contig covering the AS/PWS region, light optical, serial sectioning, and quantitative 3D-image analysis, we observed that both loci always retained a compact structure and did not form giant loops. Three-dimensional distances measured among various, homologous AS/PWS segments in 393 human lymphocytes, 132 human fibroblasts, and 129 lymphoblastoid cells from Gorilla gorilla revealed a wide range of distances at any stage of interphase and in Go. At late S phase, 4% of nuclei showed distances <= 2 mu m, 49% showed distances > 6 mu m, and 18% even showed distances > 8 mu m. A similar distance variability was found for Homo sapiens (HSA) 15 centromeres in a PWS patient with a deletion of the maternal AS/PWS locus and for the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome loci in human lymphocytes. A transient kiss during late S phase between loci widely separated at other stages of the cell cycle seems incompatible with known global constraints of chromatin movements in cycling cells. Further experiments suggest that the previously observed convergence of AS/PWS loci during late S phase was most likely a side effect of the convergence of nucleolus organizer region-bearing acrocentric human chromosomes, including HSA 15."

Potential for female kin associations in wild western gorillas despite female dispersal,"['Bradley, BJ', 'Doran-Sheehy, DM', 'Vigilant, L']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rspb.2007.0407,SEP 7 2007,39,"Female philopatry and male dispersal are the norm for most mammals, and females that remain in their natal region often derive foraging or social benefits from proximity to female kin. However, other factors, such as constraints on group size or a shortage of potential mates, may promote female dispersal even when female kin associations would be beneficial. In these cases, female kin associations might develop, not through female philopatry, but through female emigration to the same group. To date, little attention has been focused on the potential for kin-biased behaviour between females in female-dispersing species. Here we investigate the genetic relationships among adults in eight wild groups of unhabituated western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) at the Mondika Research Center using microsatellite genotyping of DNA collected from hair and faeces. We found that almost half (40%) of adult females had an adult female relative in the same group and average within-group relatedness among females was significantly higher than that expected under a model of random dispersal. This provides the first genetic evidence that females can maintain social associations with female relatives in spite of routine natal and secondary dispersal. In addition, we show that females appear to avoid related silverback males when making dispersal decisions, suggesting that a strategy of non-random female dispersal may also function to avoid inbreeding."
Spontaneously occurring mother-infant swapping and the relationships of infants with their biological and foster mothers in a captive group of lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Nakarnichi, M', 'Silldorff, A', 'Bingham, C', 'Sexton, P']",INFANT BEHAVIOR & DEVELOPMENT,10.1016/j.infbeh.2006.11.004,SEP 2007,2,"The present study describes spontaneously occurring infant-mother swapping and the relationships of infants with their biological and foster mothers after swapping in a captive social group of lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). After infant-swapping took place between a primparous mother with a neonate and a multiparous mother with a 10-month-old infant, the mothers provided appropriate maternal care, including nursing, to their adopted infants, but the older infant still sought refuge with its biological mother more frequently than with its foster mother. Almost 2 years later, the younger infant who was weaned by its foster mother began nursing from its biological mother; the latter subsequently weaned her adopted infant. Thereafter, the older infant who was weaned exhibited an abnormal hair-plucking behavior. These results indicate that it was psychologically stressful for the gorilla infant to quickly transfer its attachment figure from the mother to another adult female when the mother continued to remain in the Group.

Competition coalitions and conflict interventions among captive female gorillas,"['Scott, J', 'Lockard, JS']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-007-9161-5,AUG 2007,2,"Like mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei), western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Howletts Wild Animal Park in Kent, England, intervene in conflicts on behalf of kin. However, in each of the 3 study groups, the female gorillas also appeared to form political alliances: all members of the group almost exclusively supported familiar adult females, i.e., the ones with the greatest group tenure, and their offspring in conflicts involving adult females, the silverback, and immatures. The long-term resident high-status females (HSFs) appeared to form a supportive clique, providing effective competition against low-status females (LSFs). The former maintained dominance status over younger, less familiar adult females that were more recent to the group. Such a pattern is not typical of mountain gorillas in the wild-the subspecies for which data on female relationships are available- except perhaps when groups are unusually large, possibly because mountain gorillas experience little competition over food resources that are widely distributed and relatively freely available. In contrast, the Howletts gorillas had periodic and irregular access to high-energy/-nutrient food resources, for which dominant individuals were able to monopolize the limited available feeding spots. The pattern of agonistic alliances of Howletts females show some similarities with that of some female-philopatric cercopithecines, which also compete over defendable food resources. In female-transfer species, such as gorillas, long-term resident female cliques may be equivalent to matrilines in cercopithecines when resources are patchily distributed, highly nutritious, and defendable."
Subacromial space in african great apes and subacromial impingement syndrome in humans,"['Potau, JM', 'Bardina, X', 'Ciurana, N']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-007-9167-z,AUG 2007,4,"The subacromial space is the anatomical region limited superiorly by the acromion and the coracoacromial ligament and inferiorly by the glenoid fossa and the humeral head. In humans, the main tissues that form it and that can be affected by subacromial impingement syndrome are the subacromial bursa and the supraspinatus tendon. The syndrome is the most common degenerative pathology affecting the human shoulder, and it is characterized by an uncertain etiopathogenesis. We compared different anatomical parameters of the scapula related to the subacromial impingement syndrome in humans, between modern humans and 2 species of African apes (Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla). The 3 species we studied are orthograde primates and they present a similar structural pattern of the scapula and subacromial space, but anatomical differences exist owing to different types of locomotion used. The main differences indicate that African apes present a more curved and tilted acromion than humans, which does not, however, imply a difference in the relative size of the subacromial space among the 3 species studied. Humans also have a lower value of the relative size of the supraspinatus fossa than African great apes, and in human females have a relative lower value than males. We studied the anatomical structures of the shoulder in African apes that researchers have related to subacromial syndrome in humans to achieve a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of the syndrome."

In Experiment 1, subjects had to choose the larger of 2 quantities presented in 2 separate dishes either simultaneously or I dish after the other. Representatives of all species were capable of selecting the larger of 2 quantities in both conditions, even when the quantities were large and the numerical distance between them was small. In Experiment 2, subjects had to select between the same food quantities sequentially dropped into 2 opaque cups so that none of the quantities were ever viewed as a whole. The authors found some evidence (albeit weaker) that subjects were able to select the larger quantity of items. Furthermore, the authors found no performance breakdown with the inclusion of certain quantities. Instead, the ratio between quantities was the best performance predictor. The authors conclude that quantity-based judgments rely on an analogical system, not a discrete object file model or perceptual estimation mechanism, such as subitizing."
Rethinking incisor size and diet in anthropoids: Incisor wear and incisor breadth in the African apes,"['McCollum, MA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20606,JUL 2007,10,"In a seminal study Hylander (1975) concluded that the length of the incisor row in catarrhines considered frugivores is longer relative to body mass than in those classified as folivores. Assuming that large fruits require greater incisal processing than do leaves, stems, berries, and seeds, he argued that the larger incisors of frugivores increased their resistance to wear. The present analysis examines diet, incisor wear, and incisor crown breadth in cranial samples of western lowland gorillas and chimpanzees. Incisor wear rate was assessed on the basis of the extent of incisor crown reduction observed at sequential stages of first molar wear. Incisor metrics were obtained from the unworn teeth of juveniles. Results suggest that incisor wear is greater in the more folivorous western lowland gorillas than in more frugivorous chimpanzees. Moreover, incisor crown dimensions do not differ appreciably among African apes. These findings fail to support the hypothesis that slower wear rates are associated with broader incisor crowns, and raise new questions regarding the significance of incisor row length in anthropoids."
"A socioecological perspective on primate cognition, past and present","['Cunningham, E', 'Janson, C']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-007-0078-3,JUL 2007,22,"The papers in this special issue examine the relationship between social and ecological cognition in primates. We refer to the intersection of these two domains as socioecological cognition. Examples of socioecological cognition include socially learned predator alarm calls and socially sensitive foraging decisions. In this review we consider how primate cognition may have been shaped by the interaction of social and ecological influences in their evolutionary history. The ability to remember distant, out-of-sight locations is an ancient one, shared by many mammals and widespread among primates. It seems some monkeys and apes have evolved the ability to form more complex representations of resources, integrating ""what-where-how much"" information. This ability allowed anthropoids to live in larger, more cohesive groups by minimizing competition for limited resources between group members. As group size increased, however, competition for resources also increased, selecting for enhanced social skills. Enhanced social skills in turn made a more sophisticated relationship to the environment possible. The interaction of social and ecological influences created a spiraling effect in the evolution of primate intelligence. In contrast, lemurs may not have evolved the ability to form complex representations which would allow them to consider the size and location of resources. This lack in lemur ecological cognition may restrict the size of frugivorous lemur social groups, thereby limiting the complexity of lemur social life. In this special issue, we have brought together two review papers, five field studies, and one laboratory study to investigate the interaction of social and ecological factors in relation to foraging. Our goal is to stimulate research that considers social and ecological factors acting together on cognitive evolution, rather than in isolation. Cross fertilization of experimental and observational studies from captivity and the field is important for increasing our understanding of this relationship."
Spider monkey ranging patterns in Mexican subtropical forest: do travel routes reflect planning?,"['Valero, A', 'Byrne, RW']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-006-0066-z,JUL 2007,32,"Although it is well known that frugivorous spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi yucatanensis) occupy large home ranges, travelling long distances to reach highly productive resources, little is known of how they move between feeding sites. A 11 month study of spider monkey ranging patterns was carried out at the Otochma'ax Yetel Kooh reserve, Yucatan, Mexico. We followed single individuals for as long as possible each day and recorded the routes travelled with the help of a GPS (Global Positioning System) device; the 11 independently moving individuals of a group were targeted as focal subjects. Travel paths were composed of highly linear segments, each typically ending at a place where some resource was exploited. Linearity of segments did not differ between individuals, and most of the highly linear paths that led to food resources were much longer than the estimate visibility in the woodland canopy. Monkeys do not generally continue in the same ranging direction after exploiting a resource: travel paths are likely to deviate at the site of resource exploitation rather than between such sites. However, during the harshest months of the year consecutive route segments were more likely to retain the same direction of overall movement. Together, these findings suggest that while moving between feeding sites, spider monkeys use spatial memory to guide travel, and even plan more than one resource site in advance."
The origins of HIV and implications for the global epidemic.,"['Van Heuverswyn, Fran', 'Peeters, Martine']",Current infectious disease reports,NA,2007-Jul,48,"HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) are the result of several cross-species transmissions from primates to humans. Recently, the ancestral strains of HIV-1 groups M and N were shown to still persist in today's wild chimpanzee populations (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in south Cameroon. Lately, HIV-1 group O-related viruses have been identified in western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), called SIVgor, but chimpanzees are most likely the original reservoir of this simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. HIV-2 is the result of at least eight distinct cross-species transmissions of SIV from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) in West Africa. Although the origin of HIV-1 and HIV-2 became clearer, some important questions concerning pathogenicity and epidemic spread of certain HIV/SIV variants need to be further elucidated. Because humans are still exposed to a plethora of primate lentiviruses through hunting and handling of primate bushmeat, the possibility of additional zoonotic transfers of primate lentiviruses from other primates must be considered."

This approach has disclosed the centromere repositioning phenomenon, consisting in the activation of a novel, fully functional centromere in an ectopic location, concomitant with the inactivation of the old centromere. In this study, appropriate panels of BAC clones were used to track the chromosome I I evolutionary history in primates and nonprimate boreoeutherian mammals. Chromosome 11 synteny was found to be highly conserved in both primate and boreoeutherian mammalian ancestors. Amazingly, we detected four centromere repositioning events in primates (in Old World monkeys, in gibbons, in orangutans, and in the Homo-Pan-Gorilla (H-P-G) clade ancestor), and one in Equidae. Both HP-G and Lar gibbon novel centromeres were flanked by large duplicons with high sequence similarity. Outgroup species analysis revealed that this duplicon was absent in phylogenetically more distant primates. The chromosome 11 ancestral centromere was probably located near the HSA11q telomere. The domain of this inactivated centromere, in humans, is almost devoid of segmental duplications. An inversion occurred in chromosome 11 in the common ancestor of H-P-G. A large duplicon, again absent in outgroup species, was found located adjacent to the inversion breakpoints. In Hominoidea, almost all the five largest duplicons of this chromosome appeared involved in significant evolutionary architectural changes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

However, we suggest that selective changes that have occurred in the human lineage during the acquisition of resistance to this virus, and perhaps similar viruses, may have left our species more susceptible to infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)."

From these DNA extracts we amplified, cloned, and sequenced small segments of chloroplast DNA (part of the rbcL gene) and plant nuclear DNA (ITS-2). The obtained sequences were compared to sequences generated from known plant samples and to those in GenBank to identify plant taxa in the feces. With further optimization, this method could provide a basic evaluation of minimum primate dietary diversity even when knowledge of local flora is limited. This approach may find application in studies characterizing the diets of poorly-known, unhabituated primate species or assaying consumer-resource relationships in an ecosystem."
A review on reproductive biotechnologies for conservation of endangered mammalian species,"['Andrabi, SMH', 'Maxwell, WMC']",ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE,10.1016/j.anireprosci.2006.07.002,JUN 2007,83,"This review describes the use of modem reproductive biotechnologies or assisted reproductive techniques (ART) including artificial insemination, embryo transfer/sexing, in vitro fertilization, gamete/embryo micromanipulation, semen sexing, genome resource banking, and somatic cell nuclear transfer (cloning) in conservation programs for endangered mammalian species. Such biotechnologies allow more offspring to be obtained from selected parents to ensure genetic diversity and may reduce the interval between generations. However, the application of reproductive biotechnologies for endangered free-living mammals is rarer than for endangered domestic breeds. Progress in ART for non-domestic species will continue at a slow pace due to limited resources, but also because the management and conservation of endangered species is biologically quite complex. In practice, current reproductive biotechnologies are species-specific or inefficient for many endangered animals because of insufficient knowledge on basic reproduction like estrous cycle, seasonality, structural anatomy, gamete physiology and site for semen deposition or embryo transfer of non-domestic species.

We suggest that memory systems differ in the degree of flexibility they offer for anticipatory behavior and put forward a corresponding taxonomy of prospection. The adaptive advantage of any memory system can only lie in what it contributes for future survival. The most flexible is episodic memory, which we suggest is part of a more general faculty of mental time travel that allows us not only to go back in time, but also to foresee, plan, and shape virtually any specific future event. We review comparative studies and find that, in spite of increased research in the area, there is as yet no convincing evidence for mental time travel in nonhuman animals. We submit that mental time travel is not an encapsulated cognitive system, but instead comprises several subsidiary mechanisms. A theater metaphor serves as an analogy for the kind of mechanisms required for effective mental time travel. We propose that future research should consider these mechanisms in addition to direct evidence of future-directed action. We maintain that the emergence of mental time travel in evolution was a crucial step towards our current success."
Biological and environmental degradation of gorilla hair and microsatellite amplification success,"['Jeffery, KJ', 'Abernethy, KA', 'Tutin, CEG', 'Bruford, MW']",BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00792.x,JUN 2007,11,"Naturally shed hairs are an important source of genetic material for both conservation and forensics but are notoriously poor sources of DNA. DNA degradation in hair roots is caused by apoptosis as part of the cycle of hair growth and by autolysis in decomposing animals. Shed hairs are additionally exposed to degenerative environmental processes. However, genetic studies rarely examine hair root morphologies or refer to root growth phases prior to analysis, and detailed knowledge of the rapidity of DNA degradation amongst shed hairs is lacking. We examined the effects of biological and environmental processes on western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla Savage and Wyman) hair roots with respect to morphological characteristics and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) success at eight nuclear loci. Root type frequencies indicate that gorilla body hairs may exhibit a longer telogen phase than human head hairs. All plucked hair root types amplified more efficiently than shed hairs, and only 41% of shed hairs had root types considered suitable for genotyping. Telogen hairs from fresh nests were four-fold more useful for genotyping if the roots were associated with translucent epithelial tissue, and preselection of these root types doubled the overall data-yield to 58%. Nest age correlated with root morphology and PCR success, and PCR success was almost halved after 3 days of exposure. Finally, an association between postmortem interval, root morphology, and PCR success was observed that was consistent with postmortem changes reported in human head hairs.

Direct observations suggest that immature females have more opportunities to move between breeding groups than immature males. The distribution of kin dyadic relationships within and between groups does not, however, support this hypothesis. At larger geographical scales, dispersal is likely to be easier for males than females because of the solitary phase most blackbacks experience before founding their own breeding group. However, previous work indicates that males settle preferentially close to male kin. By specifically tracing female and male lineages with mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal genetic markers, we found that male gorillas in the 6000 km(2) area we surveyed form a single population whereas females are restricted to the individual sites we sampled and do not freely move around this area. These differences are more correctly described as differences in dispersal distances, rather than differences in dispersal rates between sexes (both sexes emigrate from their natal group in this species). Differences in resource competition and dispersal costs between female and male gorillas are compatible with the observed pattern, but more work is needed to understand if these ultimate causes are responsible for sex-biased dispersal distances in western lowland gorillas."

In the experimental design used here the subject was first habituated both to observers and to the mirror as an object before being exposed to the latter. The study was performed with a single subject who was well adapted to captivity and exhibited no aberrant behavior or signs of stress. The results revealed that the subject had no aversion to eye contact. He showed considerable interest in the mirror and appeared relaxed when faced with his image.

Fine-tuning of social play in juvenile lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Palagi, E', 'Antonacci, D', 'Cordoni, G']",DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY,10.1002/dev.20219,MAY 2007,19,"Social play, which involves cooperation, communication, and learning, may represent a suitable field for the investigation of cognitive ability in a given species. We collected data on a captive group of gorillas in order to evaluate the potential cognitive skill of juveniles in fine-tuning play behavior This study revealed that juvenile gorillas are able to ""place"" the play session in a proper spatial/temporal context, thus evaluating a complex net of factors (e.g., play partner, play roughness, group activity, space availability). When animals play fight, they use patterns of agonistic functional contexts. Since these actions are not intrinsically different from their ""serious"" context, it may be hard to distinguish them. One of the most important function of play in the ontogeny of primate social cognition may be to recognize stimuli, which may indicate the intentions of conspecifics. Accordingly, we found that juvenile gorillas are able to use play signals appropriately when a clear statement of purpose is necessary (i.e., during male-male competitive play sessions and when the escape opportunities are limited). The ability to interpret such ambiguous features of social signaling could represent a central issue in the evolution of behavioral flexibility and intelligence in primates.

Response of captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) to different housing conditions: Testing the aggression-density and coping models,"['Cordoni, G', 'Palagi, E']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/0735-7036.121.2.171,MAY 2007,9,"Several studies have suggested that primates react differently to spatial reduction. In this article, the authors tested some general hypotheses on primate response to spatial reduction by studying the Apenheul lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla; Apeldoorn, the Netherlands). The frequency of conflicts did not greatly change between the 2 housing settings, thus not supporting the density-aggression model. Indoor, gorillas performed touching behavior more often and increased their level of reconciliation. These findings support the coping model. Indoor, the gorillas also maintained broader interindividual distances by increasing the levels of sitting alone, avoidance, and dismissing behaviors. In conclusion, the Apenheul gorillas modified selectively the distribution of some patterns typical of their behavioral repertoire in response to a high-density condition. [loth avoidance and coping tactics were used, thus revealing high levels of behavioral flexibility in this species."
Distinguishing gorilla mitochondrial sequences from nuclear integrations and PCR recombinants: Guidelines for their diagnosis in complex sequence databases,"['Anthony, NM', 'Clifford, SL', 'Bawe-Johnson, M', 'Abernethy, KA', 'Bruford, MW', 'Wickings, EJ']",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.ympev.2006.09.013,MAY 2007,29,"Nuclear integrations of mitochondrial DNA (Numts) are widespread in many taxa and if left undetected can confound phylogeny interpretation and bias estimates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity. This is particularly true in gorillas, where recent studies suggest multiple integrations of the first hypervariable (HV1) domain of the mitochondrial control region. Problems can also arise through the inadvertent incorporation of artifacts produced by in vitro recombination between sequence types during polymerase chain reaction amplification. This issue has attracted little attention yet could potentially exacerbate errors in databases already contaminated by Numts. Using a set of existing diagnostic tools, this study set out to systematically inventory Numts and PCR recombinants in a gorilla HV1 sequence database and address the degree to which existing public databases are contaminated. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three distinct gorilla HV1 Numt groups (I, II, and III) that could be readily differentiated from mtDNA sequences by Numt-specific diagnostic sites and sequence-based motifs. Several instances of genuine recombination were also identified by a suite of detection methods. The location of putative breakpoints was identified by eye and by likelihood analysis. Findings from this study reveal widespread nuclear contamination of gorilla HV1 GenBank databases and underline the importance of recognizing not only Numts but also PCR recombinant artifacts as potential sources of data contamination. Guidelines for the routine identification of Numts and in vitro recombinants are presented and should prove useful in the detection of similar artifacts in other species mtDNA databases.

Natural history miscellany - Potential for Ebola transmission between gorilla and chimpanzee social groups,"['Walsh, PD', 'Breuer, T', 'Sanz, C', 'Morgan, D', 'Doran-Sheehy, D']",AMERICAN NATURALIST,10.1086/513494,2007,23,"Over the past decade Ebola hemorrhagic fever has emerged repeatedly in Gabon and Congo, causing numerous human outbreaks and massive die-offs of gorillas and chimpanzees. Why Ebola has emerged so explosively remains poorly understood. Previous studies have tended to focus on exogenous factors such as habitat disturbance and climate change as drivers of Ebola emergence while downplaying the contribution of transmission between gorilla or chimpanzee social groups. Here we report recent observations on behaviors that pose a risk of transmission among gorilla groups and between gorillas and chimpanzees. These observations support a reassessment of ape-to-ape transmission as an amplifier of Ebola outbreaks."

Gorilla-like anatomy on Australopithecus afarensis mandibles suggests Au. afarensis link to robust australopiths,"['Rak, Y', 'Ginzburg, A', 'Geffen, E']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0606454104,APR 17 2007,14,"Mandibular ramus morphology on a recently discovered specimen of Australopithecus afarensis closely matches that of gorillas. This finding was unexpected given that chimpanzees are the closest living relatives of humans. Because modern humans, chimpanzees, orangutans, and many other primates share a ramal morphology that differs from that of gorillas, the gorilla anatomy must represent a unique condition, and its appearance in fossil hominins must represent an independently derived morphology. This particular morphology appears also in Australopithecus robustus. The presence of the morphology in both the latter and Au. afarensis and its absence in modern humans cast doubt on the role of Au. afarensis as a modern human ancestor. The ramal anatomy of the earlier Ardipithecus ramidus is virtually that of a chimpanzee, corroborating the proposed phylogenetic scenario."
Yaws disease in a wild gorilla population and its impact on the reproductive status of males,"['Levrero, F', 'Gatti, S', 'Gautier-Hion, A', 'Menard, N']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20560,APR 2007,12,"We evaluated the prevalence of skin lesions in a gorilla population in the Republic of Congo. The observed lesions were typical of yaws, a treponematosis described in gorillas and humans living in tropical regions. Among the 377 gorillas identified, 17% presented skin lesions, mainly on their faces. The worst cases presented physical handicaps because of the deep lesions. As in humans, lesions break out when individuals are young. Lesions were more prevalent among males than females above 8 years old. This sex-bias prevalence could result from the behavioral characteristics of males through a greater exposure to wounds. Lesions were also more prevalent in unmated adult males (either solitaries or those living in nonbreeding groups) than in males leading breeding groups. In the case of the latter, nonaffected and affected leading males had a similar number of infants and juveniles. Still, none of the leading males ever presented serious handicaps because of the skin lesions. This suggests that adult females could favor males without lesions. Finally, lesions were more prevalent among immature animals in nonbreeding groups than in breeding groups, suggesting that either young animals with lesions disperse earlier from their natal groups, or that the disease spreads faster in nonbreeding groups. Our results provide some insights into the spread of a disease in a wild population. Further studies are required to determine if the vigor of males affects the development of the disease and if affected individuals experience social discrimination inducing a negative impact on population dynamics."
Invisible displacement understanding in domestic dogs (Canis familiaris): the role of visual cues in search behavior,"['Fiset, S', 'LeBlanc, V']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-006-0060-5,APR 2007,34,"Recently, (Collier-Baker E, Davis JM, Suddendorf T (2004) J Comp Psychol 118:421-433) suggested that domestic dogs do not understand invisible displacements. In the present study, we further investigated the hypothesis that the search behavior of domestic dogs in invisible displacements is guided by various visual cues inherent to the task rather than by mental representation of an object's past trajectory. Specifically, we examined the role of the experimenter as a function of the final position of the displacement device in the search behavior of domestic dogs. Visible and invisible displacement problems were administered to dogs (N = 11) under two conditions. In the Visible-experimenter condition, the experimenter was visible whereas in the Concealed-experimenter condition, the experimenter was visibly occluded behind a large rigid barrier. Our data supported the conclusion that dogs do not understand invisible displacements but primarily search as a function of the final position of the displacement device and, to a lesser extent, the position of the experimenter."
Different evolutionary fates of recently integrated human and chimpanzee LINE-1 retrotransposons,"['Lee, J', 'Cordaux, R', 'Han, KD', 'Wang, JX', 'Hedges, DJ', 'Liang, P', 'Batzer, MA']",GENE,10.1016/j.gene.2006.08.029,APR 1 2007,27,"The long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is a highly successful retrotransposon in mammals. L1 elements have continued to actively propagate subsequent to the human-chimpanzee divergence, similar to 6 million years ago, resulting in species-specific inserts. Here, we report a detailed characterization of chimpanzee-specific L1 subfamily diversity and a comparison with their human-specific counterparts. Our results indicate that L1 elements have experienced different evolutionary fates in humans and chimpanzees within the past similar to 6 million years. Although the species-specific L1 copy numbers are on the same order in both species (1200-2000 copies), the number of retrotransposition-competent elements appears to be much higher in the human genome than in the chimpanzee genome. Also, while human L1 subfamilies belong to the same lineage, we identified two lineages of recently integrated L1 subfamilies in the chimpanzee genome. The two lineages seem to have coexisted for several million years, but only one shows evidence of expansion within the past three million years. These differential evolutionary paths may be the result of random variation, or the product of competition between L1 subfamily lineages. Our results suggest that the coexistence of several L1 subfamily lineages within a species may be resolved in a very short evolutionary period of time, perhaps in just a few million years. Therefore, the chimpanzee genome constitutes an excellent model in which to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of L1 retrotransposons. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Our objectives were to compare the intestinal parasites of free-ranging, semicaptive, and captive orangutans and to evaluate the risk of parasite transmission in orangutan reintroduction programs. We identified 4 genera of Protozoa, 7 genera of nematodes, 1 trematode sp., and 1 cestode sp. The prevalence of Balantidium coli in free-ranging orangutans was significantly higher than in captive individuals. However, the prevalence of Strongyloides sp. was higher in captive than in free-ranging orangutans. Free-ranging female orangutans had a significantly higher total prevalence of intestinal parasites than that of males. We found no significant difference between parasite prevalences in different age groups. Compared to gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans carry a smaller variety of protozoan and nematode species. Strongyloides sp. infections form the highest risk in reintroduction programs as crowding, ground-dwelling, and poor hygiene in captive and semicaptive orangutans may cause a constant reinfection."
"Development of independence from the mother in Gorilla gorilla gorilla
","['Nowell, AA', 'Fletcher, AW']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-007-9128-6,APR 2007,21,"In gorillas, the mother takes full responsibility for carrying and feeding offspring, and lactational amenorrhea prevents her from investing in another offspring while suckling. Therefore, mothers should encourage immature gorillas to become gradually more independent until they are physically able to acquire sufficient resources, travel independently, and manage social relationships unaided. We investigated the development of independence in a population of wild western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Mbeli Bai, Nouabale-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo. We observed the spatial proximity, the development of travel, patterns of suckling and weaning, and the nature of mother-offspring interactions for 42 immature gorillas to investigate the nature of the relationship between mother and offspring. Though mother-offspring distance and independent travel increased during immaturity, with few active interactions between the dyads, offspring still continued to suckle until a median age of 4.6 yr, longer than in mountain gorillas. The tolerance of the mother toward suckling by older offspring may reflect the importance of continued nutritional investment: the temporal nature of the diet of western gorillas means that succulent fruits-likely to be preferred weaning foods-are not always available. We propose that to buffer against potential fruit shortage, mothers continue to nurse their offspring to decrease the likelihood of death from care-dependent factors and to improve an offspring's chances of survival."
"Termite feeding by Gorilla gorilla gorilla at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic","['Cipolletta, C', 'Spagnoletti, N', 'Todd, A', 'Robbins, MM', 'Cohen, H', 'Pacyna, S']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-007-9129-5,APR 2007,19,"Though insectivory by large-bodied gorillas may be unexpected, researchers have reported it in all populations of gorillas studied to date. Our study of 2 well monitored groups of western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Bai Hokou in Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African Republic provides information on frequency and variability of termite consumption (the most commonly eaten insect) as well as some of the first direct observations of the behavior. Pooled data from both groups indicate termite feeding on 34% and 83% of days, through fecal analysis and feeding trails, respectively. Direct observations revealed that termite feeding occurred on 91% of the days for 1 group, in which the silverback fed on termites during 13% of all feeding scans, making termites the most commonly observed food item. The group that had a higher density of termite mounds in its home range consumed termites more frequently than the other group did. A higher proportion of fecal samples from the silverbacks contained termite remains than the ones from adult females and juveniles. Termite consumption was lower during the dry season, but it does not correlate with rainfall, measures of fruit availability, or fruit consumption. Displacements at termite mounds occurred more than expected, indicating that they are a patchy, sought-after food resource. Gorillas did not use tools to extract termites, but they used 2 different techniques to remove them from the cells. Though culture or social traditions may cause the variation in termite consumption across sites, further investigation of termite availability and consumption is necessary to rule out ecological and methodological explanations for observed variations."
Distinguishing between the nests of sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas,"['Sanz, C', 'Morgan, D', 'Strindberg, S', 'Onononga, JR']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01278.x,APR 2007,24,"Our current inability to estimate precisely the population sizes of chimpanzees and gorillas across much of the Congo Basin has been detrimental to the development of conservation strategies for the preservation of these endangered apes. Systematic counts of nests are currently the most commonly used method to estimate ape abundance, but distinguishing between the nests of sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas has proven to be an enduring obstacle to estimating species-specific abundance. In general, the builder of more than 75% of nests recorded during surveys is undetermined. We hypothesized that sleeping habits and nest building patterns would allow us to differentiate between the nests of these apes.

We constructed a predictive model using stepwise discriminant function analysis to determine characteristics that accurately distinguished between chimpanzee and gorilla nests. We analysed 13 variables associated with 3425 ape nests from three independent surveys conducted in the Goualougo Triangle of the Nouabale-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo.

The model correctly classified more than 90% of nests in our validation subsample. Nest height, nest type, forest type and understorey closure were identified as important variables for distinguishing between chimpanzee and gorilla nests at this site. Attributing nests to either species increased the precision of resulting density estimates, which enhanced the statistical power to detect trends in population fluctuation.

Although specific variables may differ between study sites, we have demonstrated that predictive models to distinguish between the nests of sympatric chimpanzee and gorillas provide a promising approach to improving the quality of ape survey data.

Synthesis and applications. Our study introduces an innovative solution to the dilemma of discriminating between the nests of sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas, which increases the specificity and precision of resulting ape abundance estimates. There is an urgent need to improve methods to evaluate and monitor remaining ape populations across western and central Africa that are experiencing the imminent threats of emergent diseases, poaching and expanding human development. Increasing the quality of density estimates from field survey data will aid in the development of local conservation initiatives, national strategies and international policies on behalf of remaining ape populations."
Group size: Determinants in the wild and implications for the captive housing of wild mammals in zoos,"['Price, EE', 'Stoinski, TS']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2006.05.021,MAR 20 2007,13,"Group size is one of the most important factors influencing the formation and maintenance of successful social groups in captivity. For zoos, appropriate social groupings are of the utmost importance to provide examples of species-typical behaviors, as well as attain captive breeding goals. In the wild, group-living evolved largely in response to the need for predator avoidance and territory defense. The number of members in wild groups is a fundamental determinant of individual fitness, affecting net food intake and reproductive success. Captive animals encounter different environmental pressures than their wild counterparts; food availability and predation are no longer concerns, however they still face competition for mates and are unable to make the social adjustments necessary to decrease social tension. As such, group size has a large impact on the behavior, welfare and reproductive success of captive animals. Depending on the species, suboptimal sizes can be associated with increased abnormal behaviors and decreased reproductive success and infant survival in a range of captive mammals. However, in the absence of environmental constraints, many species can be housed in a greater diversity of social groups than observed in the wild. Thus, a key component of captive housing is flexibility. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Understanding visual access in common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus: perspective taking or behaviour reading?","['Burkart, JM', 'Heschl, A']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.05.019,MAR 2007,31,"We tested common marmosets' understanding of visual access in a series of experiments. In experiment 1, we investigated whether marmosets know what conspecifics do and do not see, using a food competition paradigm originally developed for chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes. Subordinate marmosets consistently chose a piece of food only visible to them and not one that was visible to a dominant competitor as well, indicating a simple mentalistic understanding of visual access (level-1 perspective taking). In experiment 2, we aimed to validate these results by using a different experimental approach, building on the marmosets' ability to use gaze as a cue. Although the marmosets precisely extrapolated gaze direction, no understanding of visual access could be found in this task. In experiment 3, we tested an alternative mechanism to account for the positive outcome in experiment 1. The results suggested that the marmosets had a predisposition to treat a piece of food that was looked at by another individual as belonging to that individual and to avoid it. The marmosets overall showed high proficiency in exactly extrapolating gaze direction but failed to show consistent and context-independent perspective-taking abilities. The findings are discussed with regard to results from other primate species and, from a broader evolutionary perspective, with regard to their implications for the emergence of sophisticated forms of gaze understanding in humans.

Mental rotation of anthropoid hands: a chronometric study,"['Gawryszewski, LG', 'Silva-dos-Santos, CF', 'Santos-Silva, JC', 'Lameira, AP', 'Pereira, A']",BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH,10.1590/S0100-879X2007000300013,MAR 2007,6,"It has been shown that mental rotation of objects and human body parts is processed differently in the human brain. But what about body parts belonging to other primates? Does our brain process this information like any other object or does it instead maximize the structural similarities with our homologous body parts? We tried to answer this question by measuring the manual reaction time (MRT) of human participants discriminating the handedness of drawings representing the hands of four anthropoid primates (orangutan, chimpanzee, gorilla, and human). Twenty-four right-handed volunteers (13 males and 11 females) were instructed to judge the handedness of a hand drawing in palm view by pressing a left/right key. The orientation of hand drawings varied from 0 degrees (fingers upwards) to 90 degrees lateral (fingers pointing away from the midline), 180 degrees (fingers downwards) and 90 degrees medial (finger towards the midline). The results showed an effect of rotation angle (F(3, 69) = 19.57, P < 0.001), but not of hand identity, on MRTs. Moreover, for all hand drawings, a medial rotation elicited shorter MRTs than a lateral rotation (960 and 1169 ms, respectively, P < 0.05). This result has been previously observed for drawings of the human hand and related to biomechanical constraints of movement performance. Our findings indicate that anthropoid hands are essentially equivalent stimuli for handedness recognition. Since the task involves mentally simulating the posture and rotation of the hands, we wondered if ""mirror neurons"" could be involved in establishing the motor equivalence between the stimuli and the participants' own hands."
New aspects of chromosomal evolution in the gorilla and the orangutan,"['Weise, A', 'Gross, M', 'Schmidt, S', 'Reichelt, F', 'Claussen, U', 'Liehr, T']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE,NA,MAR 2007,3,"It is well-accepted that studies of chromosomal changes which have occurred during the evolution of the great apes and the human provide clues towards the phylogeny of these species. Applying recently developed molecular cytogenetic approaches, this study on the chromosomes of the orangutan and the gorilla revealed the presence of cryptic, until now, unrecognized cytogenetic rearrangements mainly within the evolutionary dynamic subcentromeric and subtelomeric regions. On four orangutan chromosomes new rearrangements were detected such as a pericentric inversion in Pongo pygmaeus abeli (PPya) #1, complex rearrangements on #2 of Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus (PPYP) and PPYa and a subtelomeric deletion on PPYa&p #19. Additionally, the first centromere repositioning in the great apes was detected on PPYa&p #8. Moreover, the breakpoints of four pericentric inversions within the two orangutan subspecies and three pericentric inversions on Gorilla beringei beringei (GBEb) chromosomes #3, #11 and #13 were refined. The new molecular cytogenetic findings are discussed and compared with the available literature."
Why are some species more commonly afflicted by arthritis than others?

Important questions remain concerning the underlying causes of spondyloarthropathy in mammals, particularly regarding whether it is infectious in origin or driven by genetic predisposition and environmental stressors. Moreover, spondyloarthropathy has negative effects on host fitness, leading to potential conservation concerns if it impacts threatened species. Using a comparative data set on the prevalence of joint disease in 34 primate species and 100 carnivore species, we tested predictions involving the epidemiological correlates of spondyloarthropathy in wild mammals. Analyses revealed that 5.6% of primates and 3.6% of carnivores exhibited signs of spondyloarthropathy, with maximum incidence as high as 22% in great apes and 27% in bears. We tested whether prevalence of spondyloarthropathy increases with population density and group size, greater contact with soil, a slower host life history, increased ranging, dietary factors and body mass. We found general support for an effect of body mass, with larger bodied primates and carnivores exhibiting a higher prevalence of spondyloarthropathy. In addition, more threatened species experienced higher rates of spondyloarthropathy, with this association influenced by body mass and phylogeny. The effect of body mass could reflect that larger animals are exposed to more pathogens through greater consumption of resources, or that joints of larger bodied mammals experience greater biomechanical stresses, resulting in inflammation and activation of local joint infections."
Reliance on head versus eyes in the gaze following of great apes and human infants: the cooperative eye hypothesis,"['Tomasello, M', 'Hare, B', 'Lehmann, H', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevo1.2006.10.001,MAR 2007,92,"As compared with other primates, humans have especially visible eyes (e.g., white sclera). One hypothesis is that this feature of human eyes evolved to make it easier for conspecifics to follow an individual's gaze direction in close-range joint attentional and communicative interactions, which would seem to imply especially cooperative (mututalistic) conspecifics. In the current study, we tested one aspect of this cooperative eye hypothesis by comparing the gaze following behavior of great apes to that of human infants. A human experimenter ""looked"" to the ceiling either with his eyes only, head only (eyes closed), both head and eyes, or neither. Great apes followed gaze to the ceiling based mainly on the human's head direction (although eye direction played some role as well). In contrast, human infants relied almost exclusively on eye direction in these same situations. These results demonstrate that humans are especially reliant on eyes in gaze following situations, and thus, suggest that eyes evolved a new social function in human evolution, most likely to support cooperative (mututalistic) social interactions.

The evolutionary history of human and chimpanzee Y-chromosome gene loss,"['Perry, GH', 'Tito, RY', 'Verrelli, BC']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msm002,MAR 2007,14,"Recent studies have suggested that gene gain and loss may contribute significantly to the divergence between humans and chimpanzees. Initial comparisons of the human and chimpanzee Y-chromosomes indicate that chimpanzees have a disproportionate loss of Y-chromosome genes, which may have implications for the adaptive evolution of sex-specific as well as reproductive traits, especially because one of the genes lost in chimpanzees is critically involved in spermatogenesis in humans. Here we have characterized Y-chromosome sequences in gorilla, bonobo, and several chimpanzee subspecies for 7 chimpanzee gene-disruptive mutations. Our analyses show that 6 of these gene-disruptive mutations predate chimpanzee-bonobo divergence at similar to 1.8 MYA, which indicates significant Y-chromosome change in the chimpanzee lineage relatively early in the evolutionary divergence of humans and chimpanzees."

We develop a hidden Markov model (HMM) that incorporates this variation and relate the model parameters to population genetics quantities such as speciation times and ancestral population sizes. Our HMM is an analytically tractable approximation to the coalescent process with recombination, and in simulations we see no apparent bias in the HMM estimates. We apply the HMM to four autosomal contiguous human-chimp-gorilla-orangutan alignments comprising a total of 1.9 million base pairs. We find a very recent speciation time of human-chimp (4.1 +/- 0.4 million years), and fairly large ancestral effective population sizes (65,000 6 30,000 for the human-chimp ancestor and 45,000 6 10,000 for the human-chimp-gorilla ancestor). Furthermore, around 50% of the human genome coalesces with chimpanzee after speciation with gorilla. We also consider 250,000 base pairs of X-chromosome alignments and find an effective population size much smaller than 75% of the autosomal effective population sizes. Finally, we find that the rate of transitions between different genealogies correlates well with the region-wide present-day human recombination rate, but does not correlate with the fine-scale recombination rates and recombination hot spots, suggesting that the latter are evolutionarily transient."
Addressing nonhuman primate behavioral problems through the application of operant conditioning: Is the human treatment approach a useful model?,"['Bloomsmith, MA', 'Marr, MJ', 'Maple, TL', 'AUTOMATIC REINFORCEMENT']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2006.05.028,FEB 2007,22,"Training by the systematic application of operant conditioning has been widely applied in the care, management, exhibition, and study of nonhuman primates and many other species, but is less often used to control problematic animal behavior such as stereotyped behavior or self-injurious behavior. We review the topographical features and causal factors of stereotyped and self-injurious behavior in captive nonhuman primates, and the small number of published studies that have used operant conditioning to address these behavioral problems. The techniques developed in treating human stereotyped and self-injurious behavior are then described, and comparisons are made between the two approaches. Virtually all the techniques found to be effective treatments of stereotypy and self-injurious behavior in humans are directly applicable to similar behaviors in captive nonhuman primates. Thus the human work can serve as a model for how we can enhance our attempts to address behavioral problems in captive nonhuman primates. We advocate a philosophy of behavioral management, based partly on the science of behavior analysis, that includes a systematic, scientific approach to the discovery and description of behavioral problems and their treatment.

The shape of the hominoid proximal femur: a geometric morphometric analysis,"['Harmon, EH', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2006.00688.x,FEB 2007,24,"As part of the hip joint, the proximal femur is an integral locomotor component. Although a link between locomotion and the morphology of some aspects of the proximal femur has been identified, inclusive shapes of this element have not been compared among behaviourally heterogeneous hominoids. Previous analyses have partitioned complex proximal femoral morphology into discrete features (e.g. head, neck, greater trochanter) to facilitate conventional linear measurements. In this study, three-dimensional geometric morphometrics are used to examine the shape of the proximal femur in hominoids to determine whether femoral shape co-varies with locomotor category. Fourteen landmarks are recorded on adult femora of Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo and Hylobates. Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) is used to adjust for position, orientation and scale among landmark configurations. Principal components analysis is used to collapse and compare variation in residuals from GPA, and thin-plate spline analysis is used to visualize shape change among taxa. The results indicate that knucklewalking African apes are similar to one another in femoral shape, whereas the more suspensory Asian apes diverge from the African ape pattern. The shape of the human and orangutan proximal femur converge, a result that is best explained in terms of the distinct requirements for locomotion in each group. These findings suggest that the shape of the proximal femur is brought about primarily by locomotor behaviour."

Here we investigate population structure in the critically endangered Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli) by applying a suite of individual-based analyses to data obtained from between one-quarter and one-third of the estimated total population through the use of noninvasively collected DNA samples. The population structure inferred using data from 11 autosomal microsatellite loci was broadly consistent with geography and habitat fragmentation, but showed no simple isolation-by-distance effects. In contrast to previous field surveys, which suggested that all gorilla localities were isolated from one another, we infer low levels of gene flow and identify migrants between habitat fragments as well as individuals of admixed ancestry, suggesting persistent recent reproductive contact between many of the localities. These results are encouraging for the conservation of the Cross River gorilla population. Conservation efforts should strive to maintain connectivity between subpopulations that are still in migratory contact and attempt to restore connectivity where it has been lost."
"Variations of the mandibular shape in extant hominoids: Generic, specific, and subspecific quantification using elliptical Fourier analysis in lateral view","['Schmittbuhl, M', 'Rieger, J', 'Le Minor, JM', 'Schaaf, A', 'Guy, F']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20476,JAN 2007,14,"While a number of studies have documented the mandibular variations in hominoids, few focused on evaluating the variation of the whole outline of this structure. Using an efficient morphometrical approach, i.e. elliptical Fourier analysis, mandibular outlines in lateral view from 578 adult hominoids representing the genera Hylobates, Pongo, Gorilla, Pan, and Homo were quantified and compared. This study confirms that elliptical Fourier analysis provides an accurate characterization of the shape of the mandibular profile. Differences in mandibular shape between hominoid genera, species, subspecies, and to a lesser extent between sexes were demonstrated. Mandibles in great apes and hylobatids subspecies were generally less distinct from each other than were species. However, the magnitudes of differences among subspecies of Gorilla and Pongo approached or exceeded those between Pan troglodytes and P. paniscus. The powerful discrimination between taxa from the genus down to subspecific level associated to the relatively low level of intrageneric mandibular polymorphism in great apes provides strong evidences in support of the taxonomic utility of the shape of the mandibular profile in hominoids. In addition, morphological affinities between Pongo and Pan and the clear distinction between Homo and Pan suggest that the mandibular outline is a poor estimate of phylogenetic relationships in great apes and humans. The sexual dimorphism in mandibular shape exhibits two patterns of expression: a high degree of dimorphism in Gorilla, Pongo, and H. s. syndactylus and a relatively low one in modern humans and Pan. Besides, degree of mandibular shape dimorphism can vary considerably among closely related subspecies as observed in gorillas, arguing against the use of mandibular shape dimorphism patterns as characters in phylogenetic analyses. However, the quantification of the mandibular shape and of the variations among hominoids provides an interesting comparative framework that is likely to supply further arguments for a better understanding of the patterns of differentiation between living hominoids."

The unique functions of this hormone are provided by the FSH receptor-binding beta-subunit encoded by the FSHB gene. Resequencing and genotyping of FSHB in three European, two Asian and one African population, as well as in the great apes (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan), revealed low diversity and significant excess of polymorphisms with intermediate frequency alleles. Statistical tests for FSHB showed deviations from neutrality in all populations suggesting a possible effect of balancing selection. Two core haplotypes were identified (carried by 76-96.6% of each population's sample), the sequences of which are clearly separated from each other. As fertility most directly affects an organism's fitness, the carriers of these haplotypes have apparently had more success in human history to contribute to the next generation. There is a preliminary observation suggesting that the second most frequent FSHB haplotype may be associated with rapid conception success in females. Interestingly, the same haplotype is related to an ancestral FSHB variant shared with the ancestor of the great apes. The determination of the functional consequence of the two core FSHB variants may have implications for understanding and regulating human fertility, as well as in assisting infertility treatments."

Relationship of bone utilization and biomechanical competence in hominoid mandibles,"['Daegling, DJ']",ARCHIVES OF ORAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.archoralbio.2006.07.002,JAN 2007,20,"This investigation explores regional variation in bone mass in the mandibles of large-bodied hominoids with respect to the masticatory biomechanical environment. Cortical area, subperiosteal area, mandibular length, maximum and minimum area moments of inertia are sampled at 7 sections along the mandibular corpus in 20 specimens each of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus and Gorilla gorilla. The null hypothesis is that bone is utilized similarly among species, between sexes and among corpus locations in terms of economy of bone deployment (relative to subperiosteal area) and efficiency in producing structural stiffness (relative to cross-sectional moments of inertia). The alternative hypothesis is that dietary toughness and the scaling of muscular force recruitment produces an unfavourable stress environment in the mandible such that larger species (Gorilla and Pongo) use relatively more cortical bone than Pan and Homo.

Three-way factorial analysis of variance (with species, sex and location as main effects) indicates significant interaction of species and location for all indices of bone economy and efficiency. Sex is significant as a main effect or interacting with location in all indices of cortical area.

While allometric effects are not readily discernible in these data, the null hypothesis of a common pattern of bone utilization is decisively rejected. Human mandibles use relatively more cortical bone than those of great apes, particularly in anterior regions of the corpus. Among the apes, orangutans use very little cortical bone to achieve mechanical stiffness. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Evolutionary genomic remodelling of the human 4q subtelomere (4q35.2),"['Bodega, B', 'Cardone, MF', 'Muller, S', 'Neusser, M', 'Orzan, F', 'Rossi, E', 'Battaglioli, E', 'Marozzi, A', 'Riva, P', 'Rocchi, M', 'Meneveri, R', 'Ginelli, E']",BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1186/1471-2148-7-39,MAR 14 2007,8,"Background: In order to obtain insights into the functionality of the human 4q35.2 domain harbouring the facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) locus, we investigated in African apes genomic and chromatin organisations, and the nuclear topology of orthologous regions.

Results: A basic block consisting of short D4Z4 arrays (10-15 repeats), 4q35.2 specific sequences, and approximately 35 kb of interspersed repeats from different LINE subfamilies was repeated at least twice in the gorilla 4qter. This genomic organisation has undergone evolutionary remodelling, leading to the single representation of both the D4Z4 array and LINE block in chimpanzee, and the loss of the LINE block in humans. The genomic remodelling has had an impact on 4qter chromatin organisation, but not its interphase nuclear topology. In comparison with humans, African apes show very low or undetectable levels of FRG1 and FRG2 histone 4 acetylation and gene transcription, although histone deacetylase inhibition restores gene transcription to levels comparable with those of human cells, thus indicating that the 4qter region is capable of acquiring a more open chromatin structure. Conversely, as in humans, the 4qter region in African apes has a very peripheral nuclear localisation.

Conclusion: The 4q subtelomere has undergone substantial genomic changes during evolution that have had an impact on chromatin condensation and the region's transcriptional regulation. Consequently, the 4qter genes in African apes and humans seem to be subjected to a different strategy of regulation in which LINE and D4Z4 sequences may play a pivotal role. However, the effect of peripheral nuclear anchoring of 4qter on these regulation mechanisms is still unclear. The observed differences in the regulation of 4qter gene expression between African apes and humans suggest that the human 4q35.2 locus has acquired a novel functional relevance."

The replication profiles of three genes from different regions of chromosome X (ZFX, XIST and ATRX) were used as terms of reference. Particular emphasis was given to the evaluation of allelic replication asynchrony in relation to the inactivation status of each gene. The human cell types analysed include neuronal cells and ICF syndrome cells, considered to be a model system for the study of X inactivation. PCDH11 appeared to be generally characterized by replication asynchrony in both male and female cells, and no significant differences were observed between human and gorilla, in which this gene lacks X-Y homologous status. However, in differentiated human neuroblastoma and cerebral cortical cells PCDH11X replication profile showed a significant shift towards allelic synchrony. Our data are relevant to the complex relationship between X-inactivation, as a chromosome-wide phenomenon, and asynchrony of replication and expression status of single genes on chromosome X."

We sequenced the microsatellite of the TBP gene of 25 unrelated individuals from northern Germany (10 SCA17 patients and 15 unaffected control individuals). In addition, the microsatellites were sequenced from individuals of 10 northern German families with at least one family member affected by SCA17. To study also the evolutionary history of this CAG/CAA microsatellite in nonhuman primates, the homologous regions were analysed from Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, P. abellii, Hylobates lar, Nomascus leucogenys, Symphalangus syndactylus, Macaca mulatta, Papio hamadryas, Colobus polykomos and Callithrix jacchus. Three major conclusions were drawn: (i) Patterns of synonymous CAA interruptions in the microsatellite are characteristic and likely to result from selection for stabilizing the repetitive region; (ii) Interspecific comparisons indicate that SCA17 is likely to be a human trait. The most common allele in humans (37 repeats) is close to the threshold value upon which neurodegenerative changes can occur and may act as a repository for expanded, pathogenic alleles; (iii) The cassette-like structure of five out of 17 expanded alleles can be attributed to unequal crossing over. This can explain the rare and sporadic de novo generation of SCA17 alleles."
Influence of social and environmental factors on nesting behaviour in captive gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Weiche, I', 'Anderson, JR']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000099137,2007,1,"Field studies on gorilla sleeping sites usually emphasize environmental influences on nest site selection, as individual nesting behaviours are usually not observed directly. In captivity, nesting behaviour and influencing factors are often overlooked. In the present study, the sleeping sites of members of a captive group of 16 - 21 gorillas were analysed, based on 152 nights over a 5-year period. Subadults tended to sleep apart from adults but clustered around the oldest blackback male. Full siblings and mothers with offspring were often nearest neighbours. Some sleeping dyads notably endured. Neither age of offspring nor rank of adult females influenced neighbour choice or distances; an interadult distance of 1.5-3 m was typical. Group dynamics were reflected in nesting arrangements. We suggest that possibilities for co-nesting and choice of sleeping sites should be provided to improve the welfare of captive gorillas and other great apes. Copyright (C) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel"

It analyzes the main developments in the field, the critiques that they raised, the responses that they have generated and the current challenges faced by the field. Currently, the most plausible working hypothesis is that at least chimpanzees know what others can and cannot see. Using tasks with a high ecological validity and mapping out key concepts such association and inference are postulated as fundamental steps to further advance our knowledge in this area."
Play at work: revisiting data focusing on chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Palagi, E']",JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES,NA,2007,8,"In this article I combine old and new data to provide an up to date contribution on social play in primates and, particularly, in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Play behaviour is an ontogenetic trait in many mammalian species and is widely believed to have an important role in the assembly of adult behaviour. However play may be at work also during some peculiar situations favouring cohesion and social manipulation. Here, I investigate some topics on social play. Firstly, I investigate the social mechanisms which are at the basis of the play-partner choice by exploring the ""play intensity watching"" hypothesis. Original data are used to examine how young chimpanzees modulate play sessions by using play signals (meta-communication). Secondly, I present data on the distribution Of social play and grooming in the periods around feeding time and in a control condition, showing that play frequencies between adults and unrelated subjects are significantly higher during pre-feeding. I discuss the possibility that play behaviour can be used to prevent conflict escalation and to increase a peaceful co-feeding (pre-conflict management). Finally, in a comparative approach, I contrast data collected on the two Pan species in order to evaluate whether, despite their phylogenetic closeness and similar social structure (fission-fusion society), chimpanzees and bonobos (Pan paniscus) show differences in adult play behavior."
The role of behavioral research in the conservation of chimpanzees and gorillas,"['Lonsdorf, EV']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,NA,2007,5,"Chimpanzees and gorillas are among man's closest living relatives, sharing most of the human genetic code and having many similarities to humans in anatomy, physiology, and behavior. Like humans, these apes make and use tools and have strong family bonds. Chimpanzees even show population-specific behaviors similar to those of human cultures. However, chimpanzee and gorilla populations are in dramatic decline due to bushmeat hunting, habitat loss, and the varied risks of small, isolated populations. The first step in conserving the world's ape populations in the wild is to recognize and understand the complexities of these threats. Mitigating the risks takes a deeper understanding of ape behavior. This article provides examples of how gorilla and chimpanzee behavioral studies intersect with, and are critical to, conservation efforts."
The complex evolutionary history of gorillas: Insights from genomic data,"['Thalmann, OH', 'Fischer, AH', 'Lankester, FH', 'Paabo, SH', 'Vigilant, LH']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msl160,JAN 2007,66,"Relatively little is known about the evolutionary and demographic histories of gorillas, one of our closest living relatives. In this study, we used samples from both western (Gorilla gorilla) and eastern (Gorilla beringei) gorillas to infer the timing of the split between these geographically disjunct populations and to elaborate the demographic history of gorillas. Here we present DNA sequences from 16 noncoding autosomal loci from 15 western gorillas and 3 eastern gorillas, including 2 noninvasively sampled free-ranging individuals. We find that the genetic diversity of gorillas is similar to that of chimpanzees but almost twice as high as that of bonobos and humans. A significantly positive Fu & Li's D was observed for western gorillas, suggesting a complex demographic history with a constant, long-term population size and ancestral population structure. Among different population-split scenarios, our data suggest a complex history of western and eastern gorillas including an initial population split at around 0.9-1.6 MYA and subsequent, primarily male-mediated gene flow until approximately 80,000-200,000 years ago. Furthermore, simulations revealed that more gene flow took place from eastern to western gorilla populations than vice versa."
Primate TNF Promoters Reveal Markers of Phylogeny and Evolution of Innate Immunity,"['Baena, A', 'Mootnick, AR', 'Falvo, JV', 'Tsytsykova, AV', 'Ligeiro, F', 'Diop, OM', 'Brieva, C', 'Gagneux, P', ""O'Brien, SJ"", 'Ryder, OA', 'Goldfeld, AE']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0000621,JUL 18 2007,17,"Background. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a critical cytokine in the immune response whose transcriptional activation is controlled by a proximal promoter region that is highly conserved in mammals and, in particular, primates. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) upstream of the proximal human TNF promoter have been identified, which are markers of human ancestry. Methodology/Principal findings. Using a comparative genomics approach we show that certain fixed genetic differences in the TNF promoter serve as markers of primate speciation. We also demonstrate that distinct alleles of most human TNF promoter SNPs are identical to fixed nucleotides in primate TNF promoters. Furthermore, we identify fixed genetic differences within the proximal TNF promoters of Asian apes that do not occur in African ape or human TNF promoters. Strikingly, protein-DNA binding assays and gene reporter assays comparing these Asian ape TNF promoters to African ape and human TNF promoters demonstrate that, unlike the fixed differences that we define that are associated with primate phylogeny, these Asian ape-specific fixed differences impair transcription factor binding at an Sp1 site and decrease TNF transcription induced by bacterial stimulation of macrophages. Conclusions/significance. Here, we have presented the broadest interspecies comparison of a regulatory region of an innate immune response gene to date. We have characterized nucleotide positions in Asian ape TNF promoters that underlie functional changes in cell type-and stimulus-specific activation of the TNF gene. We have also identified ancestral TNF promoter nucleotide states in the primate lineage that correspond to human SNP alleles. These findings may reflect evolution of Asian and African apes under a distinct set of infectious disease pressures involving the innate immune response and TNF."

During an eight-month study 44 bed sites and 506 beds were found. Among these, 38.6% of bed sites and 4.1% of beds were reused. We analyzed the monthly frequency of bed-site reuse in relation to rainfall, fruit abundance, and fruit consumption by the gorillas. The different frequency of bed-site reuse in the rainy and dry seasons was not significant. More bed-site reuse was observed during the fruiting season than during the non-fruiting season. Results from fecal analysis suggested that gorillas ate more fruit in the fruiting season than in the non-fruiting season. The frugivorous diet of western gorillas may possibly cause gorillas to stay in some areas and, consequently, reuse their bed sites. Reuse of bed sites by gorillas suggests their frequent return to an area where preferred fruit is readily available. A higher percentage of arboreal beds may also affect bed-site reuse, because of the shortage of bed material."

Age-related patterns may be influenced by changes in maternal experience or physical condition, and they may reflect maternal investment trade-offs between current versus future reproduction. This article examines the influences of age and parity upon the interbirth intervals (IBI), offspring survival, and birth rates of 66 female mountain gorillas in the Virunga Volcano region from 1967-2004. Fertility was relatively low for females below age 12; improved as they matured; and then declined as they aged further. Primiparous mothers had 50% higher offspring mortality and 20% longer IBI than second-time mothers, though only the difference with IBI was statistically significant. The length of subsequent IBI was positively correlated with birth order but not with the mother's age. Mountain gorillas showed no evidence of an extended postreproductive lifespan. Age-related patterns seem most likely to reflect changes in the physical condition of the mother, but more detailed studies are needed to quantify those physical differences, and to obtain behavioral evidence that would provide more direct measures of maternal investment and experience."

We present results from a nationwide zoo-based study on behavioral and hormonal changes in female western gorillas. We evaluated progestogen concentrations via daily fecal sampling in 30 gorillas, 22 of which were geriatric (>= 30). We collected concurrent behavioral data 1-3 times weekly on 16 of the females. While control females cycled regularly, ca. 23% of geriatric females are acyclic (menopausal), and another 32% show variable hormonal patterns suggesting perimenopause. Patterns included increased variability in cycle length and peak progestogen values, and frequent insufficient increases in progestogen levels during the luteal phase. Acyclic females have significantly lower overall progestogen concentrations than the self cycling females, though differences are not significant when cycle phase is incorporated. We detected behavioral estrus in 9 of 10 cycling females for which data were available. In all but 1 case, proceptive behavior occurred during the follicular phase, preceding ovulation on average by 6.6 d. Females spent more time in proximity to the silverback male while in behavioral estrus than during other periods. To date, maximum longevity in captive female gorillas is 52 yr, with poor reproductive prognosis beginning from the age of 37. We demonstrate that both perimenopause and menopause characterize aged female gorillas, which may experience a postreproductive lifespan of > 25% of their lives. Continued study of aging apes is warranted, and apes may serve as models for age-related reproductive changes in humans."

These include the Hmg1 gene family in mice and the Hmgn2 family in humans. We investigated orthologous loci of several strains and species of Mus for presence or absence of apparently young Hmg1 retropseudogenes. Three of four analysed elements were specific toMusnuisculus, two of which were not fixed. indicative of recent evolutionary origins. Additionally we datamined a presumptive subfamily (Hmgz) of mouse Hmg1, but only identified one true element in the GenBank database. which is not consistent with a separate subfamily Status. Two of four analysed Hmgn2 retropseudogenes were specific for the human genome. whereas a third was identified in human. chimpanzee and gorilla genomes, and a fourth additionally found in orangutan but absent in African green monkey. Flanking target-site duplications were consistent with LINE integration sites supporting LINE machinery for their mechanism of amplification. The human Hmgn2 retropseudogenes. were full length, whereas the mouse Hmg1 elements were either full length or 3'-truncated at specific positions, most plausibly the result of use of alternative polyadenylation sites. The nature of their recent amplification success in relation to other retropseudogenes is unclear. although availability of a large number of transcripts during gametogenesis may be a reason. It is apparent that retropseudogenes continue to shape mammalian genomes. and may provide insight into the process of retrotransposition, as well as offer potential use as phylogenetic markers."

In order to investigate the prevalence of the blood-born hepatitis viruses in apes and monkeys living in the same area, we performed an epidemiological survey of HBV, HCV and HDV in wild-born non-human primates.

Methods We tested 441 wild-born non-human primates from Gabon and Congo and 132 imported monkeys for the presence of serological markers of HBV, HCV and HDV infections.

Results None of Cercopithecidae monkeys were reactive against HBV/HDV and HCV. In contrast, 29.2% of wild-born great apes (154 chimpanzees and 14 gorillas) were positive for HBV serological markers. Nine chimpanzees were in the replicative phase of HBV infection. None of these HBV infected chimpanzees exhibited symptoms or significant changes in serum clinical chemistry related to HBV infection.

Conclusions The negativity to HCV-related viruses and the negativity of the Cercopithecidae species tested against HBV/HDV do not allow us to definitively rule out the presence of an animal counterpart of human hepatitis viruses in non-human primates."

Researchers have used both cranial and postcranial characters to distinguish these two species. Unfortunately, of the fossil material attributed to each, only the face, palate, and upper dentition are preserved well enough in both species for direct comparisons. There are currently no known directly comparable postcranial elements. In this study, we reevaluated dental characters argued to distinguish the type specimens of Morotopithecus from Afropithecus: relative size of the upper premolars and M-3. Exact randomization methods were used to address two questions. First, is it possible to find the degree of dental-size difference observed between Morotopithecus (UMP 62-11) and Afropithecus (KNM-WK 16999) within extant African hominoids? Second, what is the probability of observing the levels of difference found between the fossils among pairs of extant individuals? Metric differences in relative premolar and M-3 size were calculated between all possible pairs within the extant sample and the observed difference of the fossil pair was then compared to the resulting distribution of extant pairs. The observed size differences for all comparisons in the fossil teeth were well within the variation observed in the extant African hominoid samples (p > 0.05). In light of these results and other currently available cranial evidence, we suggest that the type specimens of Morotopithecus and Afropithecus are not different enough to support taxonomic distinction.

Differential use of attentional and visual communicative signaling by orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) in response to the attentional status of a human,"['Poss, SR', 'Kuhar, C', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Hopkins, WD']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20304,OCT 2006,34,"In this study we investigated the communicative abilities of 10 orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and seven western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and particularly focused on their sensitivity to the attentional state of a human experimenter when choosing from a repertoire of both auditory and visual communication strategies. In experiment 1 a banana was placed in front of the subject's cage and a human experimenter was either present or absent. The subject's behavior was recorded for 60 sec. Both gorillas and orangutans gestured (t(16) = -3.58, P <.005) and vocalized (t(16) = -2.47, P <.05) more when the experimenter was present. In experiment 2 a human experimenter held a banana in front of the subject's cage and was oriented either toward or away from the subject. Again the subject's behavior was recorded for 60 sec. In this experiment both gorillas and orangutans gestured significantly more frequently (t(16) = 3.40, P <.005) when the experimenter was oriented toward them. In addition, gorillas and orangutans used other forms of visual communication signals, such as lip pout (t(16) = 3.66, P <.005), barter/trade (t(16) = 2.31, P <.05), and body present (t(16) = 2.31, P <.05) significantly more when an experimenter was facing them. The overall results indicate that both gorillas and orangutans are sensitive to the attentional state of a human experimenter and use appropriate communicative signals to gain that individual's attention. These results are also similar to previous findings on communicative behaviors in chimpanzees."
Inferences by exclusion in the great apes: the effect of age and species,"['Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-006-0037-4,OCT 2006,44,"This study investigated the ability of chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos to make inferences by exclusion using the procedure pioneered by Premack and Premack (Cognition 50:347-362, 1994) with chimpanzees. Thirty apes were presented with two different food items (banana vs. grape) on a platform and covered with identical containers. One of the items was removed from the container and placed between the two containers so that subjects could see it. After discarding this item, subjects could select between the two containers. In Experiment 1, apes preferentially selected the container that held the item that the experimenter had not discarded, especially if subjects saw the experimenter remove the item from the container (but without seeing the container empty). Experiment 3 in which the food was removed from one of the containers behind a barrier confirmed these results. In contrast, subjects performed at chance levels when a stimulus (colored plastic chip: Exp. 1; food item: Exp. 2 and Exp. 3) designated the item that had been removed. These results indicated that apes made inferences, not just learned to use a discriminative cue to avoid the empty container. Apes perceived and treated the item discarded by the experimenter as if it were the very one that had been hidden under the container. Results suggested a positive relationship between. age and inferential ability independent of memory ability but no species differences."
Evolutionary divergence of the pre-promotor region of ribosomal DNA in the great apes,"['Netchvolodov, KK', 'Boiko, AV', 'Ryskov, AP', 'Kupriyanova, NS']",DNA SEQUENCE,10.1080/10425170600752643,OCT 2006,3,"The human ribosomal intergenic spacer (rIGS) differs considerably on nucleotide sequence and regulatory elements positioning from their counterparts in the mouse, rat and Xenopus laevis. In the present study, we have PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced the rIGS fragments of about 4.5 kb length, located similar to 2 kb upstream of the rRNA transcription start point for the great apes, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus. Alignment of the primates' orthologic nucleotide sequences reveals high extent of similarity, with the exception of highly repetitious region between the two Alu repeats, nearest to the onset of transcription. Data obtained have been analyzed for further understanding of the evolution of repetitive sequences. We have also shown, that MARs/SARs; distribution patterns in the pre-promoter rIGSs of the great apes and the mouse are surprisingly similar in spite of an absence of similarity in the primary structure and regulatory elements organization in the region under study."

A survey of the Bwindi population was carried out in 2002 and results were compared with the previous census in 1997. Our estimate of total population size increased over that period by c. 7% to 320 individuals and the structure and distribution of the population were largely unchanged. Signs of human disturbance were more common in 2002 than 1997, and gorillas tended to be found in areas of relative low disturbance. This suggested that disturbance could be a constraint on population growth and distribution but demographic stochasticity may also be responsible for the observed level of population change over a short time period. Other potential limiting factors, including habitat availability and disease, are discussed. While conservation activities in Bwindi have probably contributed to the stability of the population, strengthening of law enforcement and continued vigilance are needed to ensure the population's long-term growth and survival."
The rules and the reality of mountain gorilla Gorilla beringei beringei tracking: how close do tourists get?,"['Sandbrook, C', 'Semple, S']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605306001323,OCT 2006,12,"Mountain gorilla Gorilla beringei beringei tracking tourism generates important revenue for conservation efforts but brings with it the threat of disease transmission into the gorilla population. This study quantifies for the first time aspects of encounters between gorillas and tourists at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park that are likely to contribute to the risk of disease transmission. These include how close tourists get to gorillas, how close encounters are initiated, how long they last, and the age class of gorillas involved. Tourists got significantly closer to gorillas than the park rules allow (a mean of 2.76 m, compared to the rule of 7 m), and remained close for long periods. Contacts with the gorillas most vulnerable to disease, the juveniles, were closer but of shorter duration than those with adults. Contacts initiated by gorillas were closer but shorter than those initiated by tourists. Taken together these results demonstrate that the present rules are failing, and that the risk of disease transmission may be greater than previously believed."
Food transfers in immature wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Nowell, AA', 'Fletcher, AW']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-006-0181-0,OCT 2006,10,"The transfer of food items between individuals has been described in primates as serving an informative purpose in addition to supplementing the diet of immature individuals. This behaviour has yet to be described in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and results are presented here of observations of food transfers in immature gorillas at Mbeli Bai, Republic of Congo. The frequency of food transfers decreased with increasing immature age, while the frequency of independent feeding and processing of food increased. Transfers between mothers and infants were the most frequent, with infants attempting to take items from the mother. These attempts were not always successful and the item was relinquished on less than 50% of attempts. Mothers also took items from their offspring. The results point to the functional significance of food transfers in western lowland gorillas being informational. In a bai environment, where one species forms the majority of a visiting gorilla's diet despite other species being available, the initiation of food transfers by immatures is proposed to serve the purpose of familiarising them with which species, and which parts of those species, may be eaten."
Decaying wood is a sodium source for mountain gorillas,"['Rothman, JM', 'Van Soest, PJ', 'Pell, AN']",BIOLOGY LETTERS,10.1098/rsbl.2006.0480,SEP 22 2006,39,"Like several other non-human primates, mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda consume decaying wood, an interesting but puzzling behaviour. This wood has little obvious nutritional value; it is low in protein and sugar, and high in lignin compared to other foods. We collected pieces of wood eaten and avoided by gorillas, and other foods consumed by gorillas, and measured their sodium content. Wood was substantially higher in sodium than other dietary items, and wood pieces from stumps eaten contained more sodium than those that were avoided. Wood represented only 3.9% of the wet weight food intake of gorillas, but contributed over 95% of dietary sodium, leading us to conclude that decaying wood is an important sodium source for Bwindi gorillas. Because sodium has been leached from the weathered soils characteristic of the subhumid and humid tropics, and because terrestrial plants generally do not require sodium, tropical herbivores, including gorillas, often encounter problems locating the sodium essential for their wellbeing. Decaying wood is an unexpected sodium source."
"Patterns of craniofacial integration in extant Homo, Pan, and Gorilla","['Polanski, JM', 'Franciscus, RG']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20421,SEP 2006,25,"Brain size increased greatly during Pleistocene human evolution, while overall facial and dentognathic size decreased markedly. This mosaic pattern is due to either selective forces that acted uniquely on each functional unit in a modularized, developmentally uncoupled craniofacial complex, or alternatively, selection that acted primarily on one unit, with the other responding passively as part of a coevolved set of ontogenetically and evolutionarily integrated structures. Using conditional independence modeling on homologous linear measurements of the height, breadth, and depth of the cranium in Pan (n = 95), Gorilla (n = 102), and recent Homo (n = 120), we reject the null hypothesis of equal levels of overall cranial integration. While all three groups share the pattern of greater neurocranial integration with distinct separation between the face and neurocranium (modularization), family differences do exist. The apes are more integrated in their entire crania, but display a particularly strong pattern of integration within the facial complex related to prognathism. Modern humans display virtually no facial integration, a pattern which is likely related to their markedly decreased facial projection. Modern humans also differ from their great ape counterparts in being more integrated within the breadth dimension of the cranial vault, likely tied to the increase in brain size and eventual globularity seen in human evolution. That the modern human integration pattern differs from the ancestral African great ape pattern along the inverse neurocranial-facial trend seen in human evolution indicates that this shift in the pattern of integration is evolutionarily significant, and may help to clarify aspects of the current debate over defining modern humans."

Anthrax in western and Central African great apes,"['Leendertz, FH', 'Lankester, F', 'Guislain, P', 'Neel, C', 'Drori, O', 'Dupain, J', 'Speede, S', 'Reed, P', 'Wolfe, N', 'Loul, S', 'Mpoudi-Ngole, E', 'Peeters, M', 'Boesch, C', 'Pauli, G', 'Ellerbrok, H', 'Leroy, EM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20298,SEP 2006,23,"During the period of December 2004 to January 2005, Bacillus anthracis killed three wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and one gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in a tropical forest in Cameroon. While this is the second anthrax outbreak in wild chimpanzees, this is the first case of anthrax in gorillas ever reported. The number of great apes in Central Africa is dramatically declining and the populations are seriously threatened by diseases, mainly Ebola. Nevertheless, a considerable number of deaths cannot be attributed to Ebola virus and remained unexplained. Our results show that diseases other than Ebola may also threaten wild great apes, and indicate that the role of anthrax in great ape mortality may have been underestimated. These results suggest that risk identification, assessment, and management for the survival of the last great apes should be performed with an open mind, since various pathogens with distinct characteristics in epidemiology and pathogenicity may impact the populations. An animal mortality monitoring network covering the entire African tropical forest, with the dual aims of preventing both great ape extinction and human disease outbreaks, will create necessary baseline data for such risk assessments and management plans.

Functional morphology of the first cervical vertebra in humans and nonhuman primates.,"['Manfreda, Evelyn', 'Mitteroecker, Philipp', 'Bookstein, Fred L', 'Schaefer, Katrin']","Anatomical record. Part B, New anatomist",10.1002/ar.b.20113,2006-Sep,15,"The cervical vertebral column bears or balances the weight of the head supported by the nuchal muscles that partly originate from the cervical vertebrae. The position of the head relative to the vertebral column, and consequently locomotion and posture behavior, could thus be associated with the form of the cervical vertebrae. In spite of this assumption and some empirical indications along these lines, primate vertebral morphologies have been reported to be very similar and not clearly related to locomotion. We therefore study the relationship between the morphology of the first cervical vertebra, the atlas, and the locomotion pattern within primates using a geometric morphometric approach. Our analysis is based on a total of 116 vertebrae of adult Homo sapiens, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, Hylobates lar, Macaca mulatta, Papio hamadryas, Ateles geoffroyi, and Alouatta palliata. On each atlas, 56 landmarks were digitized and superimposed by Procrustes registration. The resulting shape variables were analyzed by principal component analysis, multivariate regression, and partial least-squares analysis. We found that the nine primate species differ clearly in their atlas morphology and that allometric shape change is distinct between the nonhuman primates and Homo sapiens. We could further identify morphological features that relate to the species' locomotion pattern. Human atlas shape, however, cannot be predicted by an extrapolation of the nonhuman primate model. This implies that either the primate atlas is generalized enough to allow bipedal locomotion or else the human atlas morphology is a unique adaptation different from that in the more orthograde nonhuman primates.

Nucleotide variation and haplotype diversity in a 10-kb noncoding region in three continental human populations,"['Zhao, ZM', 'Yu, N', 'Fu, YX', 'Li, WH']",GENETICS,10.1534/genetics.106.060301,SEP 2006,18,"Noncoding regions are usually less subject to natural selection than coding regions and so may be more useful for studying human evolution. The recent surveys of worldwide DNA variation in four 10-kb noncoding regions revealed many interesting but also some incongruent patterns. Here we studied another 10-kb noncoding region, which is in 6p22. Sixty-six single-nucleotide polymorphisms were found among the 122 worldwide human sequences, resulting in 46 genotypes, from which 48 haplotypes were inferred. The distribution patterns of DNA variation, genotypes, and haplotypes suggest rapid population expansion in relatively recent times. The levels of polymorphism within human populations and divergence between humans and chimpanzees at this locus were generally similar to those for the other four noncoding regions. Fu and Li's tests rejected the neutrality assumption in the total sample and in the African sample but Tajima's test did not reject neutrality. A detailed examination of the contributions of various types of mutations to the parameters used in the neutrality tests clarified the discrepancy between these test results. The age estimates suggest a relatively young history in this region. Combining three autosomal noncoding regions, we estimated the long-term effective population size of humans to be 11,000 2800 using Tajima's estimator and 17,600 4700 using Watterson's estimator and the age of the most recent common ancestor to be 860,000 258,000 years ago."
"Evidence for involvement of TRE-2 (USP6) oncogene, low-copy repeat and acrocentric heterochromatin in two families with chromosomal translocations","['Ou, ZS', 'Jarmuz, M', 'Sparagana, SP', 'Michaud, J', 'Decarie, JC', 'Yatsenko, SA', 'Nowakowska, B', 'Furman, P', 'Shaw, CA', 'Shaffer, LG', 'Lupski, JR', 'Chinault, AC', 'Cheung, SW', 'Stankiewicz, P']",HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s00439-006-0200-7,SEP 2006,3,"We report clinical findings and molecular cytogenetic analyses for two patients with translocations [t(14;17)(p12;p12) and t(15;17)(p12;p13.2)], in which the chromosome 17 breakpoints map at a large low-copy repeat (LCR) and a breakage-prone TRE-2 (USP6) oncogene, respectively. In family 1, a 6-year-old girl and her 5-year-old brother were diagnosed with mental retardation, short stature, dysmorphic features, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). G-banding chromosome analysis showed a der(14)t(14;17)(p12;p12) in both siblings, inherited from their father, a carrier of the balanced translocation. Chromosome microarray and FISH analyses revealed that the PMP22 gene was duplicated. The chromosome 17 breakpoint was mapped within an similar to 383 kb LCR17pA that is known to also be the site of several breakpoints of different chromosome aberrations including the evolutionary translocation t(4;19) in Gorilla gorilla. In family two, a patient with developmental delay, subtle dysmorphic features, ventricular enlargement with decreased periventricular white matter, mild findings of bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria and a very small anterior commissure, a cryptic duplication including the Miller-Dieker syndrome region was identified by chromosome microarray analysis. The chromosome 17 breakpoint was mapped by FISH at the TRE-2 oncogene. Both partner chromosome breakpoints were mapped on the short arm acrocentric heterochromatin within or distal to the rRNA cluster, distal to the region commonly rearranged in Robertsonian translocations. We propose that TRE-2 together with LCR17pA, located similar to 10 Mb apart, also generated the evolutionary gorilla translocation t(4;19). Our results support previous observations that the USP6 oncogene, LCRs, and repetitive DNA sequences play a significant role in the origin of constitutional chromosome aberrations and primate genome evolution."
Evolution of an intronic microsatellite polymorphism in Toll-like receptor 2 among primates,"['Yim, JJ', 'Adams, AA', 'Kim, JH', 'Holland, SM']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s00251-006-0141-2,SEP 2006,5,"Nonhuman primates express varying responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis: New World monkeys appear to be resistant to tuberculosis (TB) while Old World monkeys seem to be particularly susceptible. The aim of this study was to elucidate the presence of the regulatory guanine-thymine (GT) repeat polymorphisms in intron 2 of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) associated with the development of TB in humans and to determine any variations in these microsatellite polymorphisms in primates. We sequenced the region encompassing the regulatory GT repeat microsatellites in intron 2 of TLR2 in 12 different nonhuman primates using polymerase chain reaction amplification, TA cloning, and automatic sequencing. The nonhuman primates included for this study were as follows: chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), bonobo (Pan paniscus), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), Celebes ape (Macaca nigra), rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), pigtail macaque (Macaca nemestrina), patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas), spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), Woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagotricha), tamarin (Saguinus labiatus), and ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta). Nucleotide sequences encompassing the regulatory GT repeat region are similar across species and are completely conserved in great apes. However, Old World monkeys lack GT repeats altogether, while New World monkeys and ring-tailed lemurs have much more complex structures around the position of the repeats. In conclusion, the genetic structures encompassing the regulatory GT repeats in intron 2 of human TLR2 are similar among nonhuman primates. The sequence is most conserved in New World monkeys and less in Old World monkeys."
Size and shape variation in Australopithecus afarensis proximal femora,"['Harmon, EH']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.01.009,SEP 2006,17,"The degree of size and shape variation in the A. afarensis fossil sample has been interpreted in a variety of ways. Size variation has been described as exceeding that of extant hominoids, similar to that of strongly sexually dimorphic hominoids, and best matched to modem humans. The degree of shape variation has been characterized both as great and negligible. Recent fieldwork has increased the proximal femora] sample, providing new data with which to examine variation. The proximal femur of A. afarensis is analyzed in a comparative framework in order to gauge the magnitude of size and shape variation in this element.

Seven of the best-preserved A. aprensis proximal femora contribute to the analysis (A.L. 128-1, A.L. 152-2, A.L. 211-1, A.L. 288-lap, A.L. 333-3, A.L. 333-123, A.L. 827-1). Comparative samples from Pan, Pongo, Gorilla, and Homo provide context for interpreting variation among the fossils. The coefficient of variation (CV) of linear measurements is used to estimate size variation. Bootstrap resampling of CVs from extant hominoids provides distributions for comparison to A. afarensis CVs. Ratios of linear measurements provide scale-free shape variables that are used in pairwise comparisons. The Euclidean distance between pairs of A. afarensis are compared to the Euclidean distances between extant hominoid pairs.

As found in some earlier analyses, size variation in A. afarensis is accommodated best in gorillas and orangutans. The magnitude of difference in shape between A. afarensis pairs is exceeded by most taxa, indicating that shape variation is not extreme. These general findings are contradicted by a few instances of excessive size and shape variation. These are uncharacteristic results and could point to temporal bias, although other alternatives are explored. The signal from the proximal femur is that size variation in A. afarensis is like that of the strongly sexually dimorphic apes, and shape variation is well within the range of most hominoids irrespective of their degree of size dimorphism.

Molar microwear in Praeanthropus afarensis: Evidence for dietary stasis through time and under diverse paleoecological conditions,"['Grine, FE', 'Ungar, PS', 'Teaford, MF', 'El-Zaatari, S', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.04.004,SEP 2006,70,"Molar microwear fabrics in extant mammals vary with diet and, more particularly, the physical properties of the items that are consumed. Praeanthropus afarensis is well represented in the fossil record over a prolonged and radiometrically controlled temporal span, and reasonably robust paleoecological reconstructions are available for the various localities from which it is known. We therefore examined molar microwear in this species to determine whether diet varied in relation to time or in response to different ecological conditions. Of more than 70 specimens of Pr. afarensis that contain one or more worn permanent molars, only 19 were found to be suitable for microwear analysis. These derive from eight temporal horizons in the Laetolil Beds and Hadar Formation spanning approximately 400 kyr (3.6-3.2 Ma). Six paleoecological categories have been reconstructed for these horizons, and these were ranked on the basis of floral cover. None of the microwear variables observed for Pr. afarensis is significantly associated with either temporal or paleoecological rank. Thus, microwear and, by extension, diet does not appear to have altered significantly in Pr. afarensis through time or in response to different paleoecological circumstances. The wear pattern that appears to have characterized Pr. afarensis overlaps extensively that of Gorilla gorilla beringei and differs notably from the fabrics of extant primates (e.g., Cebus apella and Cercocebus albigena) that consume hard objects. The high proportion of scratches on Pr. afarensis molars suggests the inclusion of fine abrasives in or on the food items consumed by those individuals sampled in this study. Although Pr. afarensis may have been morphologically equipped to process hard, brittle items, the microwear data suggest that it did not necessarily do so, even in the face of varying environmental circumstances. Explanatory scenarios that describe Pr. afarensis as part of an evolutionary trajectory involving a more heavily masticated diet with an increased reliance on hard, brittle items need to be reconsidered. However, fallback foods that were consumed during relatively short, albeit critical periods may have exerted sufficient selective pressure to explain the evolution of the comparatively robust Pr. afarensis trophic apparatus. Because it is unlikely that many individuals from such restricted temporal intervals would be sampled in the paleontological record, we suggest that the most productive approach to the elucidation of paleodiet is the integration of genetic (morphological) and epigenetic (microwear and isotopic) lines of evidence.

Cholesterol values in free-ranging gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei) and Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus),"['Schmidt, DA', 'Ellersieck, MR', 'Cranfield, MR', 'Karesh, WB']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/05-040.1,SEP 2006,8,"Cholesterol concentrations in captive gorillas and orangutans vary widely within species and average approximately 244 mg/dI for gorillas and 169 mg/dI for orangutans as published previously. The International Species Inventory System reports higher concentrations of 275 and 199 mg/dI for gorillas and orangutans, respectively. It is unknown whether these values were typical, influenced by captive management, or both. To answer this question, banked serum samples from free-ranging mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei), western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) were analyzed for total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Mountain gorillas did not differ significantly from free-ranging western lowland gorillas in cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, indicating mountain gorilla values could be a model for western lowland gorillas. Captive gorilla total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in free-ranging groups. Triglyceride concentrations for captive gorillas were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the male mountain and western lowland gorillas, but they were not significantly different from the female mountain gorillas. Captive orangutan total cholesterol concentrations were only higher (P < 0.05) than the free-ranging female orangutans, whereas captive orangutan low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than both free-ranging male and female orangutans. Calculated and measured low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were compared for all free-ranging animals and were significantly different (P < 0.05) for all groups, indicating Friedewald's equation for calculating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is not appropriate for use with nonfasted apes. The higher total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in captive apes may predispose them to cardiovascular disease and might be attributed to diets, limited energy expenditure, and genetics."
Identification of the ancestral killer immunoglobulin-like receptor gene in primates,"['Sambrook, JG', 'Bashirova, A', 'Andersen, H', 'Piatak, M', 'Vernikos, GS', 'Coggill, P', 'Lifson, JD', 'Carrington, M', 'Beck, S']",BMC GENOMICS,10.1186/1471-2164-7-209,AUG 15 2006,35,"Background: Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR) are essential immuno- surveillance molecules. They are expressed on natural killer and T cells, and interact with human leukocyte antigens. KIR genes are highly polymorphic and contribute vital variability to our immune system. Numerous KIR genes, belonging to five distinct lineages, have been identified in all primates examined thus far and shown to be rapidly evolving. Since few KIR remain orthologous between species, with only one of them, KIR2DL4, shown to be common to human, apes and monkeys, the evolution of the KIR gene family in primates remains unclear.

Results: Using comparative analyses, we have identified the ancestral KIR lineage ( provisionally named KIR3DL0) in primates. We show KIR3DL0 to be highly conserved with the identification of orthologues in human ( Homo sapiens), common chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes), gorilla ( Gorilla gorilla), rhesus monkey ( Macaca mulatta) and common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus). We predict KIR3DL0 to encode a functional molecule in all primates by demonstrating expression in human, chimpanzee and rhesus monkey. Using the rhesus monkey as a model, we further show the expression profile to be typical of KIR by quantitative measurement of KIR3DL0 from an enriched population of natural killer cells.

Conclusion: One reason why KIR3DL0 may have escaped discovery for so long is that, in human, it maps in between two related leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor clusters outside the known KIR gene cluster on Chromosome 19. Based on genomic, cDNA, expression and phylogenetic data, we report a novel lineage of immunoglobulin receptors belonging to the KIR family, which is highly conserved throughout 50 million years of primate evolution."
Adaptive selection of mitochondrial complex I subunits during primate radiation,"['Mishmar, D', 'Ruiz-Pesini, E', 'Mondragon-Palomino, M', 'Procaccio, V', 'Gaut, B', 'Wallace, DC']",GENE,10.1016/j.gene.2006.03.015,AUG 15 2006,46,"Mammalian oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV and V are assembled from both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) encoded subunits, with complex I encompassing 39 nDNA and seven mtDNA subunits. Yet the sequence variation of the mtDNA genes is more than ten fold greater than that of the nDNA encoded genes of the OXPHOS complexes and the mtDNA proteins have been found to be influenced by positive (adaptive) selection. To maintain a functional complex I, nDNA and mtDNA subunits must interact, implying that certain nDNA complex I genes may also have been influenced by positive selection. To determine if positive selection has influenced nDNA complex I genes, we analyzed the DNA sequences of all of the nDNA and mtDNA encoded complex I subunits from orangutan, gorilla, chimpanzee, human and all available vertebrate sequences. This revealed that three nDNA complex I genes (NDUFC2, NDUFA1, and NDUFA4) had significantly increased amino acid substitution rates by both PAML and Z-test, suggesting that they have been subjected to adaptive selection during primate radiation. Since all three of these subunits reside in the membrane domain of complex I along with the mtDNA subunits, we compared amino acid changes in these three nDNA genes with those of the mtDNA genes across species. Changes in the nDNA NDUFC2 cysteine 39 were found to correlate with those in the mtDNA ND5 cysteine 330. Therefore, adaptive selection has influenced some nDNA complex I genes and nDNA and mtDNA complex I genes may have co-evolved. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Postconflict behavior in captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Mallavarapu, S', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Bloomsmith, MA', 'Maple, TL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20279,AUG 2006,22,"Postconflict (PC) behaviors, including reconciliation and consolation, have been observed in many primate and several nonprimate species. Using the PC-matched control (MC) method, PC behavior was examined in two groups (n = 13) of captive western lowland gorillas, a species for which no conflict resolution data have been published. Analyses of 223 conflicts showed significantly more affiliation between former opponents after a conflict when compared to control periods, indicating reconciliation. Results also showed significantly more affiliation between the victim and a third-party after a conflict, indicating consolation. Both solicited and unsolicited consolation were observed. The majority of the affiliative interactions observed for both reconciliation and consolation were social proximity, which suggests that unlike most nonhuman primates, proximity, rather than physical contact, may be the main mechanism for resolving conflicts in western lowland gorillas. PC behavior was not uniform throughout the groups, but rather varied according to dyad type."
Pathogens as drivers of population declines: The importance of systematic monitoring in great apes and other threatened mammals,"['Leendertz, FH', 'Pauli, G', 'Maetz-Rensing, K', 'Boardman, W', 'Nunn, C', 'Ellerbrok, H', 'Jensen, SA', 'Junglen, S', 'Boesch, C']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2006.05.002,AUG 2006,101,"Until recently, the focus of great ape behavioural and ecological research has been distinct from the focus of scientists working in medical and veterinary sciences. More scientists are calling for a connection between medical and field research due to recent disease outbreaks in great apes, including Ebola, and indications of cross-transmission of Ebola and other viruses between primates and humans. A major limitation to progress is the lack of information on infectious diseases and their transmission in wild primates. Here, we present examples of successful pathogen detection in wild great apes and describe approaches and techniques that can be used in the field, focusing in particular on investigation of deaths and non-invasive sample collection. This interdisciplinary approach is providing new insights to infectious diseases of great apes and is helping to protect the health of great ape populations. This framework can also be applied to other mammals under threat from infectious diseases, including African wild dogs, seals and Tasmanian devils. In addition to providing benefits for great ape conservation, research that integrates infectious disease with primate ecology provides insights to emerging diseases in humans and the role of disease in primate evolution.

Density-based load estimation using two-dimensional finite element models: a parametric study.,"['Bona, Max A', 'Martin, Larry D', 'Fischer, Kenneth J']",Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering,10.1080/10255840600792451,2006-Aug,3,"A parametric investigation was conducted to determine the effects on the load estimation method of varying: (1) the thickness of back-plates used in the two-dimensional finite element models of long bones, (2) the number of columns of nodes in the outer medial and lateral sections of the diaphysis to which the back-plate multipoint constraints are applied and (3) the region of bone used in the optimization procedure of the density-based load estimation technique. The study is performed using two-dimensional finite element models of the proximal femora of a chimpanzee, gorilla, lion and grizzly bear. It is shown that the density-based load estimation can be made more efficient and accurate by restricting the stimulus optimization region to the metaphysis/epiphysis. In addition, a simple method, based on the variation of diaphyseal cortical thickness, is developed for assigning the thickness to the back-plate. It is also shown that the number of columns of nodes used as multipoint constraints does not have a significant effect on the method."
Impacts of roads and hunting on central African rainforest mammals,"['Laurance, WF', 'Croes, BM', 'Tchignoumba, L', 'Lahm, SA', 'Alonso, A', 'Lee, ME', 'Campbell, P', 'Ondzeano, C']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00420.x,AUG 2006,124,"Road expansion and associated increases in hunting pressure are a rapidly growing threat to African tropical wildlife. In the rainforests of southern Gabon, we compared abundances of larger (> 1 kg) mammal species at varying distances from forest roads and between hunted and unhunted treatments (comparing a 130-km(2) oil concession that was almost entirely protected from hunting with nearby areas outside the concession that had moderate hunting pressure). At each of 12 study sites that were evenly divided between hunted and unhunted areas, we established standardized 1-km transects at five distances (50, 300, 600, 900, and 1200 m) from an unpaved road, and then repeatedly surveyed mammals during the 2004 dry and wet seasons. Hunting had the greatest impact on duikers (Cephalophus spp.), forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), and red river bogs (Potamochoerus porcus), which declined in abundance outside the oil concession, and lesser effects on lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and carnivores. Roads depressed abundances of duikers, sitatungas (Tragelaphus spekei gratus), and forest elephants (Loxondonta africana cyclotis), with avoidance of roads being stronger outside than inside the concession. Five monkey species showed little response to roads or hunting, whereas some rodents and pangolins increased in abundance outside the concession, possibly in response to greater forest disturbance. Our findings suggest that even moderate hunting pressure can markedly alter the structure of mammal communities in central Africa. Roads had the greatest impacts on large and small ungulates, with the magnitude of road avoidance increasing with local bunting pressure."
A faithful record of stressful life events preserved in the dental developmental record of a juvenile Gorilla,"['Schwartz, GT', 'Reid, DJ', 'Dean, MC', 'Zihlman, AL']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-006-9051-2,AUG 2006,27,"The pattern and rate of dental development are critical components of the life history of primates. Much recent research has focused on dental development in chimpanzees and other hominoids, but comparatively little is known about dental development in Gorilla. To date, dental chronologies for Gorilla are based on a sample of 1 and information about variations in the time and timing of crown initiation and completion is lacking. We provide data on dental development in 1 captive, juvenile, female, western lowland Gorilla gorilla gorilla of known age, sex, life events, and date of death (carefully documented as part of zoo records) that experienced various physical insults during her first year of life. The perfect natural experiment allowed us to test the association of the timing of accentuated stress lines in teeth with significant physiological and psychological events during ontogeny of this juvenile gorilla. We analyzed histological sections from 14 permanent teeth (maxillary and mandibular I1-M2) and assessed crown initiation (CI) and crown formation times (CFT) using short- and long-period incremental lines in both enamel and dentine; they are advanced for all teeth compared to previously published chronology. The data suggest a relatively accelerated pace of dental development in gorillas compared to chimpanzees and fit an emerging pattern of an accelerated life history schedule in gorillas. Data on the timing of major accentuated lines in the developing dentition are tightly associated with exact dates of surgical procedures and follow-up hospital visits as recorded on zoo medical records. Our data highlight the importance of captive individuals with well-documented medical records for studying life history."
Characterization of Bacillus anthracis-like bacteria isolated from wild great apes from Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon,"['Klee, SR', 'Ozel, M', 'Appel, B', 'Boesch, C', 'Ellerbrok, H', 'Jacob, D', 'Holland, G', 'Leendertz, FH', 'Pauli, G', 'Grunow, R', 'Nattermann, H']",JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY,10.1128/JB.00303-06,AUG 2006,65,"We present the microbiological and molecular characterization of bacteria isolated from four chimpanzees and one gorilla thought to have died of an anthrax-like disease in Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon. These isolates differed significantly from classic Bacillus anthracis by the following criteria: motility, resistance to the gamma phage, and, for isolates from Cameroon, resistance to penicillin G. A capsule was expressed not only after induction by CO, and bicarbonate but also under normal growth conditions. Subcultivation resulted in beta-hemolytic activity and gamma phage susceptibility in some subclones, suggesting differences in gene regulation compared to classic B. anthracis. The isolates from Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon showed slight differences in their biochemical characteristics and MICs of different antibiotics but were identical in all molecular features and sequences analyzed. PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed the presence of both the toxin and the capsule plasmid, with sizes corresponding to the B. anthracis virulence plasmids pXO1 and pXO2. Protective antigen was expressed and secreted into the culture supernatant. The isolates possessed variants of the Ba813 marker and the SG-749 fragment differing from that of classic B. anthracis strains. Multilocus sequence typing revealed a close relationship of our atypical isolates with both classic B. anthracis strains and two uncommonly virulent Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. We propose that the newly discovered atypical B. anthracis strains share a common ancestor with classic B. anthracis or that they emerged recently by transfer of the B. anthracis plasmids to a strain of the B. cereus group."

The goal of the study was to assess the amounts of fiber, protein, and sugars in the foods eaten by the Bwindi gorillas, and to determine whether condensed tannins and cyanide are present in these foods. A total of 127 food plant parts representing 84 plant species eaten by two groups of Bwindi gorillas were collected, processed, and analyzed for their chemical contents. The Bwindi gorilla ate foods that contain 2-28% crude protein (CP), 21-88% neutral detergent fiber (NDF), 14-60% acid detergent fiber (ADF), 2-42% acid detergent lignin (ADL), and <= 1-50% water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) on a dry matter (DM) basis. Moisture in these foods ranged from 7% to 96%. Approximately 35% of the foods analyzed contained condensed tannins, and two foods contained cyanogenic glycosides. This is the first detailed report regarding the nutritional chemistry of gorilla foods in Bwindi, many of which are also eaten by other primates. This unique data set adds to our knowledge about the nutritional composition of foods eaten by gorillas across habitats, is useful for understanding aspects of feeding behavior, and provides valuable comparative data for optimizing the diets of gorillas ex situ."
How great apes perform on a modified trap-tube task,"['Mulcahy, NJ', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-006-0019-6,JUL 2006,58,"To date, neither primates nor birds have shown clear evidence of causal knowledge when attempting to solve the trap tube task. One factor that may have contributed to mask the knowledge that subjects may have about the task is that subjects were only allowed to push the reward away from them, which is a particularly difficult action for primates in certain problem solving situations. We presented five orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), two chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), two bonobos (Pan paniscus), and one gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) with a modified trap tube that allowed subjects to push or rake the reward with the tool. In two additional follow-up tests, we inverted the tube 180 degrees rendering the trap nonfunctional and also presented subjects with the original task in which they were required to push the reward out of the tube. Results showed that all but one of the subjects preferred to rake the reward. Two orangutans and one chimpanzee (all of whom preferred to rake the reward), consistently avoided the trap only when it was functional but failed the original task. These findings suggest that some great apes may have some causal knowledge about the trap-tube task. Their success, however, depended on whether they were allowed to choose certain tool-using actions."
"Tracking the displacement of objects: A series of tasks with great apes (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla gorilla, and Pongo pygmaeus) and young children (Homo sapiens)","['Barth, J', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-ANIMAL BEHAVIOR PROCESSES,10.1037/0097-7403.32.3.239,JUL 2006,59,"The authors administered a series of object displacement tasks to 24 great apes and 24 30-month-old children (Homo sapiens). Objects were placed under I or 2 of 3 cups by visible or invisible displacements. The series included 6 tasks: delayed response, inhibition test, A not B, rotations, transpositions, and object permanence. Apes and children solved most tasks performing at comparable levels except in the transposition task, in which apes performed better than children. Ape species performed at comparable levels in all tasks except in single transpositions, in which chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) performed better than gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and orangutans (Pongo pygmeatis). All species found nonadjacent trials and rotations especially difficult. The number of elements that changed locations, the type of displacement, and having to inhibit predominant reaching responses were factors that negatively affected the subjects' performance."
SSADH variation in primates: Intra- and interspecific data on a gene with a potential role in human cognitive functions,"['Blasi, P', 'Palmerio, F', 'Aiello, A', 'Rocchi, M', 'Malaspina, P', 'Novelletto, A']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-005-0154-8,JUL 2006,7,"In the present study we focus on the nucleotide and the inferred amino acid variation occurring in humans and other primate species for mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, a gene recently supposed to contribute to cognitive performance in humans. We determined 2527 bp of coding, intronic, and flanking sequences from chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, and macaque. We also resequenced the entire coding sequence on 39 independent chromosomes from Italian families. Four variable coding sites were genotyped in additional populations from Europe, Africa, and Asia. A test for constancy of the nonsynonymous vs. synonymous rates of nucleotide changes revealed that primates are characterized by largely variable d(N)/d(S) ratios. On a background of strong conservation, probably controlled by selective constraints, the lineage leading to humans showed a ratio increased to 0.42. Human polymorphic levels fall in the range reported for other genes, with a pattern of frequency and haplotype structure strongly suggestive of nonneutrality. The comparison with the primate sequences allowed inferring the ancestral state at all variable positions, suggesting that the c.538(C) allele and the associated functional variant is indeed a derived state that is proceeding to fixation. The unexpected pattern of human polymorphism compared to interspecific findings outlines the possibility of a recent positive selection on some variants relevant to new cognitive capabilities unique to humans."
Captive female gorilla agonistic relationships with clumped defendable food resources,"['Scott, J', 'Lockard, JS']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-005-0167-3,JUL 2006,10,"Minimal feeding competition among female mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) has resulted in egalitarian social relationships with poorly defined agonistic dominance hierarchies. Thus, gorillas are generally viewed as non-competitive egalitarian folivores that have had little need to develop effective competitive strategies to access food resources. However, this generalization is inconsistent with more recent research indicating that most gorillas are frugivorous, feeding on patchily distributed food resources. The current study at Howletts Wild Animal Park, Kent, England, explores the effects of clumped and defendable foods on female gorilla agonistic relationships among three groups of western lowland gorillas (G. g. gorilla), conditions that are predicted to lead to well-differentiated agonistic dominance hierarchies among female primates. The Howletts gorillas foraged all day on low-energy/-nutrient, high-fiber foods widely distributed around their enclosure by the keepers. However, they also had periodic access to high-energy foods (e.g., nuts, raisins, strawberries, etc.) that the keepers would spread in a clumped and defendable patch. Frequencies of agonistic and submissive behaviors between females and proximity data were gathered. High-status females were found to monopolize the food patch and kept the low-status females at bay with cough-grunt threat vocalizations or by chasing them away. Agonistic interactions were initiated mostly by females of high status; these were directed towards females of low status and were generally not reciprocal. In addition, females of low status engaged in submissive behaviors the most often, which they directed primarily at females of high status, especially in response to aggression by the latter. Agonistic interactions between high- and low-status females had decided outcomes more often than not, with low-status females the losers. Competition over highly desirable foods distributed in defendable clumps at Howletts appears to have led to well-defined dominance relationships among these female gorillas."
Comparative and familial analysis of handedness in great apes,"['Hopkins, WD']",PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN,10.1037/0033-2909.132.4.538,JUL 2006,87,"Historically, population-level handedness has been considered a hallmark of human evolution. Whether nonhuman primates exhibit population-level handedness remains a topic of considerable debate. This paper summarizes published data on handedness in great apes. Comparative analysis indicated that chimpanzees and bonobos show population-level right handedness, whereas gorillas and orangutans do not. All ape species showed evidence of population-level handedness when considering specific tasks. Familial analyses in chimpanzees indicated that offspring and maternal (but not paternal) handedness was significantly positively correlated, but this finding was contingent upon the classification criteria used to evaluate hand preference. Overall, the proportion of right handedness is lower in great apes compared with humans, and various methodological and theoretical explanations for this discrepancy are discussed."
Biological and cultural anthropology of a changing tropical forest: A fruitful collaboration across subfields,"['Hardin, R', 'Remis, MJ']",AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST,10.1525/aa.2006.108.2.273,JUN 2006,8,"In this article, we integrate approaches from biological and cultural anthropology to describe changing relationships between humans and animals in the Dzanga-Ndoki Park and Dzanga-Sangha Dense Forest Reserve (RDS), Central African Republic (CAR). Recent decades have seen a rapid proliferation of human activities, with striking tensions between logging and conservation economies. Our data suggest that certain animals and humans initially adapted successfully to these forest uses, and that local residents have crafted culturally rich new ways of living in the forest. However, our longitudinal data indicate animal declines and expanding frontiers of increasingly intensive human use. These trends are altering previous territorial arrangements and coming to undermine today's remarkably rich spectrum of human-animal encounters there. Our combined approach offers an alternative to increasingly distinct method and theory between anthropology's subfields. We sketch a research agenda for integrated anthropological attention to environmental change, especially to transformations in human-animal interactions and entanglements."
Interpretation of bootstrap values in phylogenetic analysis.,"['Wiesemuller, Bernhard', 'Rothe, Hartmut']",Anthropologischer Anzeiger; Bericht uber die biologisch-anthropologische Literatur,NA,2006-Jun,2,"Bootstrap Analysis is a common tool in cladistics, and consequently many authors tend to believe that it could be close to a test of monophyly. In fact, it is only a procedure to calculate the redundancy of a certain character pattern among taxa. To demonstrate this, we set up a study with questionable data: Four skulls of great apes and humans were digitally photographed, and the pixels' brightness values were simply transformed to a one-zero-matrix, which was then used to calculate a Wagner tree with PHYLIP. As a rule, the higher the resolution of the photos is, the higher are the bootstrap values of supported taxa (and the lower are the bootstrap values of non-supported data). Redundancy of intertaxic information might indeed be an indicator of phylogenetic relationship, but can also be due to other reasons, like functional-adaptive needs in morphology, or semantic needs in a DNA-code. As a result, we tend to believe that high bootstrap values are actually less important than low ones. It is safer, based on a low bootstrap value, to claim that a certain taxon is not well supported by certain data. Therefore, we recommend discussions of low bootstrap values in future publications."
Morphological analysis of the hindlimb in apes and humans. I.

Muscle mass and fascicle length data were obtained for all major hindlimb muscles. Physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) was estimated. Data were normalized assuming geometric similarity to allow for comparison of animals of different size/species. Muscle mass scaled closely to (body mass)(1.0) and fascicle length scaled closely to (body mass)(0.3) in most species. However, human hindlimb muscles were heavy and had short fascicles per unit body mass when compared with non-human apes. Gibbon hindlimb anatomy shared some features with human hindlimbs that were not observed in the non-human great apes: limb circumferences tapered from proximal-to-distal, fascicle lengths were short per unit body mass and tendons were relatively long. Non-human great ape hindlimb muscles were, by contrast, characterized by long fascicles arranged in parallel, with little/no tendon of insertion. Such an arrangement of muscle architecture would be useful for locomotion in a three dimensionally complex arboreal environment."

Moment arms varied with joint motion and were generally longer in proximal limb muscles than distal limb muscles. The shape of the moment arm curves (i.e. the plots of moment arm against joint angle) differed in different hindlimb muscles and in the same muscle in different subjects (both in the same and in different ape species). Most moment arms increased with increasing joint flexion, a finding which may be understood in the context of the employment of flexed postures by most non-human apes (except orang-utans) during both terrestrial and arboreal locomotion. When compared with humans, non-human great apes tended to have muscles better designed for moving the joints through large ranges. This was particularly true of the pedal digital flexors in orang-utans. In gibbons, the only lesser ape studied here, many of the moment arms measured were relatively short compared with those of great apes. This study was performed on a small sample of apes and thus differences noted here warrant further investigation in larger populations."

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) was found to decrease more rapidly with age than total cholesterol, resulting in an increasing ratio of cholesterol HDL with age. The ratio of apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A1 also increased with age. Establishment of a database of blood lipid values for captive gorillas with correlative analysis of animals with known atherosclerosis status may help to identify sensitive predictors of coronary heart disease risk."

However, the sample size is extremely small, relying upon mostly fractured specimens and a few sectioned specimens, providing an estimate of enamel thickness only. What is needed to fully understand the significance of enamel thickness is a non-destructive technique that is able to obtain the thickness, density, and volume of the dental hard tissues of large samples, thereby providing an accurate means of relating thickness, area, volume, and the pattern of distribution of both enamel and dentin. Investigators have attempted to circumvent this problem by developing a variety of indexes. However, we are still left with subjective descriptions, such as 'thin', 'thick', 'intermediate thick', and 'hyperthick'. The purpose of this investigation was therefore to demonstrate the ability of high-resolution X-ray computed microtomography (HRXCT), as a non-destructive method, to produce, accurately and reliably, contiguous slices revealing the thickness and area of enamel, dentin, and pulp chamber. Using imaging software, three-dimensional reconstructions were produced, which provided volume data for enamel and dentin. Three-dimensional reconstruction of HRXCT images provide, for the first time, the capability of accurately quantifying enamel and dentin thickness, distribution and volume, thereby eliminating the necessity of destructive thin-sectional analysis."
Independent evolution of bitter-taste sensitivity in humans and chimpanzees,"['Wooding, S', 'Bufe, B', 'Grassi, C', 'Howard, MT', 'Stone, AC', 'Vazquez, M', 'Dunn, DM', 'Meyerhof, W', 'Weiss, RB', 'Bamshad, MJ']",NATURE,10.1038/nature04655,APR 13 2006,69,"It was reported over 65 years ago that chimpanzees, like humans, vary in taste sensitivity to the bitter compound phenylthiocarbamide (PTC)(1). This was suggested to be the result of a shared balanced polymorphism, defining the first, and now classic, example of the effects of balancing selection in great apes. In humans, variable PTC sensitivity is largely controlled by the segregation of two common alleles at the TAS2R38 locus, which encode receptor variants with different ligand affinities(2-4). Here we show that PTC taste sensitivity in chimpanzees is also controlled by two common alleles of TAS2R38; however, neither of these alleles is shared with humans. Instead, a mutation of the initiation codon results in the use of an alternative downstream start codon and production of a truncated receptor variant that fails to respond to PTC in vitro. Association testing of PTC sensitivity in a cohort of captive chimpanzees confirmed that chimpanzee TAS2R38 genotype accurately predicts taster status in vivo. Therefore, although Fisher et al.'s observations(1) were accurate, their explanation was wrong. Humans and chimpanzees share variable taste sensitivity to bitter compounds mediated by PTC receptor variants, but the molecular basis of this variation has arisen twice, independently, in the two species."

Apes' use of iconic cues in the object-choice task,"['Herrmann, E', 'Melis, AP', 'Tomasello, M']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-005-0013-4,APR 2006,9,"In previous studies great apes have shown little ability to locate hidden food using a physical marker placed by a human directly on the target location.

In the first two experiments, we found that if an iconic cue is given in addition to a spatial/indexical cue - e.g., picture or replica of a banana placed on the target location - apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, gorillas) as a group performed above chance. However, we also found in two further experiments that when iconic cues were given on their own without spatial/indexical information (iconic cue held up by human with no diagnostic spatial/indexical information), the apes were back to chance performance. Our overall conclusion is that although iconic information helps apes in the process of searching hidden food, the poor performance found in the last two experiments is due to apes' lack of understanding of the informative (cooperative) communicative intention of the experimenter."
Sumatran orangutans and a yellow-cheeked crested gibbon know what is where,"['Scheumann, M', 'Call, J']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-006-9024-5,APR 2006,8,"In their natural habitats orangutans and gibbons have to solve spatial problems to find enough food, which is distributed over large areas and available at different times of the year. Therefore both species should evolve spatial memory skills to remember spatial locations and their content. We conducted 2 studies in a 1900-m(2) naturalistic outdoor enclosure. In the 1st study, we hid kiwi pieces in 10 different locations and placed kiwi pieces in a visible location. Individuals of both species approached significantly more food locations in the test condition than in the control condition in which no food was hidden. In the 2nd study, we hid 2 types of food in 10 different locations so that individuals had to remember which food type was where. We hid bananas on trees (banana condition) and grapes under bamboo shrubs (grape condition). We also placed oranges in full view (control condition) to rule out the possibility that finding food may automatically trigger an indiscriminate search. Individuals approached the banana locations more often in the banana than in the other 2 conditions. Some orangutans, but not the gibbon, also approached the grape locations more often in the grape than in the other 2 conditions. Individuals often returned to locations in which they previously found food and rarely revisited locations in the same session. We detected little influence of the food quantity and no influence of the distance to each location on the subjects' foraging behavior."
Effects of forest type and human presence on bonobo (Pan paniscus) density in the Salonga National Park,"['Reinartz, GE', 'Isia, IB', 'Ngamankosi, M', 'Wema, LW']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-006-9020-9,APR 2006,21,"Our study elucidates how forest type characteristics and human presence influence bonobo (Pan paniscus) densities and assesses whether the Salonga National Park harbors a substantial bonobo population. We searched 11 locations in the Salonga for the presence of bonobos and sampled 9 study sites using line transects to estimate relative bonobo nest density, the proportion of forest types, and the intensity of human activity. We classified forests into broad types by overstory and understory composition, canopy cover, and hydrology, and calculated encounter rates for bonobo, human, and large mammal signs. Bonobo signs occurred in 8 of 11 locations but varied widely in frequency. Mean density was 0.72 nest-builders/km(2), but density was not uniform across sites (range=0-2.8 nest-builders/km(2)). Of 11 forest types encountered, the most common were mixed mature forest with an herbaceous (Marantaceae) understory (36.8%), with a woody understory (23.6%), and old secondary forest with a Marantaceae understory (10.5%). Nest sites occurred only in these forest types, called nest-forest types. Bonobo density was highest in locations comprising > 80% nest-forest types. Nests occurred more frequently in the mixed mature/Marantaceae forest. Nest-site density correlates positively with the nest-forest patch length we encountered on transects, implying that forest patch size and consistency may influence bonobo density. Mean nest group size correlates positively with proportion of nest-forest types found at a site, suggesting that increased resource availability-nesting sites and food-allows larger group size. A significant inverse association existed between bonobo density and human presence."
Sequencing and haplotype analysis of the Activator of CREM in the Testis (ACT) gene in populations of fertile and infertile males,"['Christensen, GL', 'Wooding, SP', 'Ivanov, IP', 'Atkins, JF', 'Carrell, DT']",MOLECULAR HUMAN REPRODUCTION,10.1093/molehr/ga1006,APR 2006,14,"cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) is a key transcription factor in the differentiation of round spermatids into mature spermatozoa. During spermiogenesis, CREM is regulated in part by activator of CREM in the testis (ACT), which activates CREM in a phosphorylation-independent fashion. We hypothesized that the ACT gene, which is expressed exclusively in the testis, could be involved in male factor infertility in patients with idiopathic-impaired spermatogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the coding regions and flanking intronic regions of the ACT gene in 96 azoo- or oligospermic patients and 69 fertile controls. A total of 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was identified, and four of them leading to amino acid substitutions. An association study was performed based on calculated haplotype frequencies, and statistically significant differences were found between the patient and control populations for some haplotypes. To help establish the evolutionary relationships between the haplotypes, the coding regions of both the chimpanzee and the gorilla ACT gene were sequenced and evaluated. To test whether the different haplotypes conferred a functional change to the ACT protein, a yeast two-hybrid assay was designed to test the interaction between the two most divergent ACT haplotypes and their known binding partners, CREM and KIF17b. We identified one ACT haplotype that had a 45% reduction in its interaction with CREM. Our results suggest that different haplotypes within the ACT gene may contribute to male factor subfertility."
Living in nonbreeding groups: An alternative strategy for maturing gorillas,"['Levrero, F', 'Gatti, S', 'Menard, N', 'Petit, E', 'Caillaud, D', 'Gautier-Hion, A']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20223,MAR 2006,15,"The one-male reproductive strategy implies that maturing males are temporarily excluded from reproduction. In gorillas, these excluded males live either solitarily or in nonbreeding groups (NBGs) that are devoid of adult females. The dynamics of NBGs are not well known. In this study, which was conducted on a gorilla population (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) of 377 individuals that visited the Lokoue clearing in the Republic of Congo, we detail how the NBGs formed, and analyze their dynamics according to age-sex classes, the relatedness of members, and the origin and destination of transferring individuals. We discuss the potential benefits gained by individuals living in these groups. The NBGs included mainly immature males, most of which appeared to have migrated voluntarily from their natal groups. Some individuals (including juvenile females) came from disbanded breeding groups (BGs). Migrants preferentially joined NBGs that included a silverback male. Their dispersal patterns were not determined by their degree of relatedness, but they tended to associate with related silverbacks. In this way, the migrants could enhance their protection against predators and gain experience with different environmental conditions. By tolerating and protecting offspring, aging silverbacks could enhance their inclusive fitness. Finally, young and healthy silverbacks could increase their likelihood of forming a future BG when unrelated females joined them."
"Object manipulation to obtain a food reward in hoolock gibbons, Bunopithecus hoolock","['Cunningham, CL', 'Anderson, JR', 'Mootnick, AR']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.05.013,MAR 2006,23,"Gibbons (family Hylobatidae) have rarely been studied in terms of object manipulation and tool use. We assessed whether hoolock gibbons can learn to pull on a rake-like object to gain a food reward, in a zero-order manipulation task, without specific training. Their learning style was assessed along with their understanding of the tertiary relationships between the rake, a goal object and an environmental feature. Hoolocks used a rake to pull in an out-of-reach food item in less than 90 s on first presentation. The gibbons' behaviour suggests that perceptually restructuring the environment may be within this species' abilities. Their causal understanding of three factors, the rake, the reward and a trap into which the reward could fall and be lost, was moderately better than that of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, and capuchins, Cebus spp., on a similar task. Learning of simple associative rules, rather than understanding the physical properties of the trap, might explain the gibbons' performance.

Identification of large-scale human-specific copy number differences by inter-species array comparative genomic hybridization,"['Goidts, V', 'Armengol, L', 'Schempp, W', 'Conroy, J', 'Nowak, N', 'Muller, S', 'Cooper, DN', 'Estivill, X', 'Enard, W', 'Szamalek, JM', 'Hameister, H', 'Kehrer-Sawatzki, H']",HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s00439-005-0130-9,MAR 2006,26,"Copy number differences (CNDs), and the concomitant differences in gene number, have contributed significantly to the genomic divergence between humans and other primates. To assess its relative importance, the genomes of human, common chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan and macaque were compared by comparative genomic hybridization using a high-resolution human BAC array (aCGH). In an attempt to avoid potential interference from frequent intra-species polymorphism, pooled DNA samples were used from each species. A total of 322 sites of large-scale inter-species CND were identified. Most CNDs were lineage-specific but frequencies differed considerably between the lineages; the highest CND frequency among hominoids was observed in gorilla. The conserved nature of the orangutan genome has already been noted by karyotypic studies and our findings suggest that this degree of conservation may extend to the sub-microscopic level. Of the 322 CND sites identified, 14 human lineage-specific gains were observed. Most of these human-specific copy number gains span regions previously identified as segmental duplications (SDs) and our study demonstrates that SDs are major sites of CND between the genomes of humans and other primates. Four of the human-specific CNDs detected by aCGH map close to the breakpoints of human-specific karyotypic changes [e.g., the human-specific inversion of chromosome 1 and the polymorphic inversion inv(2)(p11.2q13)], suggesting that human-specific duplications may have predisposed to chromosomal rearrangement. The association of human-specific copy number gains with chromosomal breakpoints emphasizes their potential importance in mediating karyotypic evolution as well as in promoting human genomic diversity."

This is the first report of Cryptosporidium and other protozoan infections (Entamoeba spp., lodamoeba, Chilomastix, and Balantidium Spp.) in wild primates that inhabit the natural forest of Sri Lanka. It is unclear if non-human primates serve as a reservoir for these parasites under certain conditions. A cross-sectional coprologic survey among 125 monkeys (89 toque macaques, 21 gray langurs, and 1.5 purple-faced langurs) indicated that Cryptosporidium was detected in all three primate species and was most common among monkeys using areas and water that had been heavily soiled by human feces and livestock. Most macaques (96%) ;shedding Cryptosporidium oocysts were co-infected with other protozoans and important anthropozoonotic gastrointestinal parasites (e.g., Enterobius and Strongyloides). The transmission of these parasites among primates in the wild may have important implications for public health as well as wildlife conservation management."
Lumbar diskectomy in a human-habituated mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei),"['Aryan, HE', 'Jandial, R', 'Nakaji, P', 'Greenberg, MS', 'Janssen, DL', 'Huang, J', 'Taylor, WR']",CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY,10.1016/j.clineuro.2004.12.011,FEB 2006,2,"The authors report a case of a human-habituated mountain gorilla, Alvila, resident at the San Diego Zoo, who was found to have a herniated intervertebral lumbar disc after being attacked by the gorilla troop's silverback male gorilla. Ultimately, the gorilla required surgical intervention for her disease and made a full recovery. To our knowledge, this is the only known case of spine surgery. A 36-year-old female human-habituated mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei), resident at the San Diego Zoo, was noticed by caregivers to walk with a substantial limp after being attacked by the gorilla troop's silverback male gorilla. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of her lumbar spine revealed a large herniated disk at the L1-2 level on the right. This finding appeared to correlate well with the gorilla's symptoms. The gorilla underwent a lumbar diskectomy under loupe. Post-operatively the gorilla did very well. The right leg weakness was immediately improved post-operatively. The gorilla continued to ""crutch walk"" initially, swinging on the upper extremities and not bearing weight on the lowers. However, by 2 weeks the limp was no longer noticeable to the zoo caregivers. The wound healed well and there was no evidence of wound infection or CSF leak. The gorilla was reunited with her troop and has reintegrated well socially. With 10 months of follow-up, the gorilla continues to do well. This is the only known case of spine surgery in a gorilla. For best surgical results, one needs to consider the similarities and differences between the gorilla and human vertebral anatomy. We believe that careful pre-operative planning contributed to the good early post-operative result. Ultimate assessment of the long-term outcome will require additional follow-up.

Structural variation of the monoamine oxidase A gene promoter repeat polymorphism in nonhuman primates,"['Wendland, JR', 'Hampe, M', 'Newman, TK', 'Syagailo, Y', 'Meyer, J', 'Schempp, W', 'Timme, A', 'Suomi, SJ', 'Lesch, KP']",GENES BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2005.00130.x,FEB 2006,16,"By conferring allele-specific transcriptional activity on the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene in humans, length variation of a repetitive sequence [(variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR)] in the MAOA promoter influences a constellation of personality traits related to aggressive and antisocial behavior and increases the risk of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Here, we have analyzed the presence and variability of this MAOA promoter repeat in several species of nonhuman primates. Sequence analysis of MAOA's transcriptional control region revealed the presence of the VNTR in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), bonobo (Pan paniscus), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and Gelada baboon (Theropithecus gelada). The majority of P. troglodytes and P. paniscus showed a single repeat with a sequence identical to the VNTR sequence in humans. In contrast, analyses of the remaining species revealed shorter sequences similar to the first 18 bp of human VNTR. Compared with other nonhuman primates, the VNTR sequence of M. mulatta showed the highest length variability with allele frequencies of 35, 25 and 40% for the five, six and seven repeat variants, respectively. The extent of variability of the MAOA promoter repeat in both rhesus monkeys and humans supports the notion that there may be a relationship between functional MAOA expression and aggression-related traits in humans and rhesus macaque populations."
Fixation of the human-specific CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase pseudogene and implications of haplotype diversity for human evolution,"['Hayakawa, T', 'Aki, I', 'Varki, A', 'Sattax, Y', 'Takahata, N']",GENETICS,10.1534/genetics.105.046995,FEB 2006,30,"The human CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase gene (CMAH) suffered deletion of an exon that encodes an active center for the enzyme similar to 3.2 million years ago (MYA). We analyzed a 7.3-kb intronic region of 132 CMAH genes to explore the fixation process of this pseudogene and the demographic implication of its haplotype diversity. Fifty-six variable sites were sorted into 18 different haplotypes with significant linkage disequilibrium. Despite the rather low nucleotide diversity, the most recent common ancestor at CMAH dates to 2.9 MYA. This deep genealogy follows shortly after the original exon deletion, indicating that the deletion has fixed in the population, although whether this fixation was facilitated by natural selection remains to be resolved. Remarkable features are exceptionally long persistence of two lineages and the confinement of one lineage in Africa, implying that some African local populations were in relative isolation while others were directly involved in multiple African exoduses of the genus Homo. Importantly, haplotypes found in Eurasia suggest interbreeding between then-contemporaneous human species. Although population structure within Africa complicates the interpretation of phylogeographic information of haplotypes, the data support a single origin of modern humans, but not with complete replacement of archaic inhabitants by modern humans."
Identification by full-coverage array CGH of human DNA copy number increases relative to chimpanzee and gorilla,"['Wilson, GM', 'Flibotte, S', 'Missirlis, PI', 'Marra, MA', 'Jones, S', 'Thornton, K', 'Clark, AG', 'Holt, RA']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.4456006,FEB 2006,36,"Duplication of chromosomal segments and associated genes is thought to be a primary mechanism for generating evolutionary novelty. By comparative genome hybridization using a full-coverage (tiling) human BAC array with 79-kb resolution, we have identified 63 chromosomal segments, ranging in size from 0.65 to 1.3 Mb, that have inferred copy number increases in human relative to chimpanzee. These segments span 192 Ensembl genes, including 82 gene duplicates (41 reciprocal best BLAST matches). Synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates across these pairs provide evidence for general conservation of the amino acid sequence, consistent with the maintenance of function of both copies, and one case of putative positive selection for an uncharacterized gene. Surprisingly, the core histone genes H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 have been duplicated in the human lineage since our split with chimpanzee. The observation of increased copy number of a human cluster of core histone genes suggests that altered dosage, even of highly constrained genes, may be an important evolutionary mechanism."
Human F7 sequence is split into three deep clades that are related to FVII plasma levels,"['Sabater-Lleal, M', 'Soria, JM', 'Bertranpetit, J', 'Almasy, L', 'Blangero, J', 'Fontcuberta, J', 'Calafell, F']",HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s00439-005-0045-5,FEB 2006,11,"It is widely accepted that FVII levels are strongly, consistently, and independently related to cardiovascular risk. These levels are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Among the genetic factors, only a limited number of polymorphisms in the F7 gene have been reported, and they explain only a small proportion of the genetic variability. Recently, we have accomplished the complete dissection of the F7 quantitative trait locus responsible for all of the genetic variability observed in FVII levels. Now, we present the thorough study of the haplotype organization of F7 DNA sequence variation among individuals and the evolutionary processes that produced this variation, by sequencing 15 kb of genomic DNA sequence from the F7 locus in 40 unrelated individual (80 chromosomes) from the genetic analysis of idiopathic thrombophilia (GAIT) project as well as four non-human primate species. Our study revealed 49 polymorphisms, of which 39 SNPs were further considered. Genotyping of these DNA variations in the whole family-based GAIT sample helped resolve linkage phases, and a total of 37 distinct haplotypes were identified.

Tajima's D was significantly positive in this sample, suggesting balancing selection. This parameter was a reflection of the phylogenetic structure of F7 haplotype, which was deeply split into three well-supported clades or haplogroups, suggesting that functional differences among F7 variants do not depend on a few single-site variations. Moreover, haplogroup 2 was associated with high FVII levels and haplogroup 3 with low levels. In this study, we have for the first time established a clear relation between genotypic variability structure and phenotypic variability of a particular quantitative trait involved in a complex disease."
"Ape abundance and habitat use in the Goualougo Triangle, Republic of Congo","['Morgan, D', 'Sanz, C', 'Onononga, JR', 'Strindberg, S']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-005-9013-0,FEB 2006,42,"Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) populations in central Africa are rapidly declining as a result of disease epidemics, commercial bushmeat hunting, and habitat destruction. Our main objective was to estimate the absolute abundance and habitat utilization of chimpanzees and gorillas in the intact forests of the Goualougo Triangle in the Republic of Congo, and in an adjacent area in which selective logging will take place in the near future. The estimates provide a unique baseline for apes inhabiting an undisturbed environment. A second objective was to compare estimates of abundance and patterns of habitat utilization generated by different techniques: 1) distance sampling of individual ape nests and nest sites along line transects, 2) direct observations of apes during reconnaissance surveys, and 3) observations of ape traces during reconnaissance surveys. We completed a total of 222 km of line transect surveys in 4 sampling areas, resulting in overall density estimates of 1.53 chimpanzees/km(2) and 2.34 gorillas/km(2) from nest sites. We generated a density estimate of 2.23 chimpanzees/km(2) from direct observations during reconnaissance surveys of a semihabituated community in 1 of the 4 sampling areas. Habitat use profiles that nest surveys depicted on transects differed from those of direct observations and traces we encountered on reconnaissance surveys. We found the highest overall abundance of chimpanzee nests in monodominant Gilbertiodendron forest, whereas our direct observations showed that chimpanzees preferred mixed species forest. Transects that traversed the core area of the community range had the highest encounter rates of chimpanzee nests and nest sites. Gorilla nests on transects showed a preference only for mixed species forest with an open canopy, but direct observations and traces on reconnaissance surveys clearly indicated that gorillas use several habitat types. We conclude by evaluating the precision of these nest surveys and our ability to detect future trends in ape densities in the Goualougo Triangle."
Fetal ultrasonography: biometric data from four African primate species,"['Bourry, O', 'Ouwe-Missi-Oukem-Boyer, O', 'Blanchard, A', 'Rouquet, P']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1111/j.1600-0684.2005.001410.x,FEB 2006,3,"Background Nonhuman primates are raised in large numbers in research centers and zoos. Reproductive monitoring is required to improve breeding performances. Ultrasonography is a safe method to determine gestational age and to estimate the date of parturition. However only few data are available in nonhuman primates.

Methods Fetal biometric data were obtained throughout pregnancy on four African primate species, namely chimpanzee, gorilla, mandrill and patas monkey. Measurements included biparietal diameter, transverse abdominal diameter, femur and humerus length, external interorbital diameter, and fetal heart rate. Curves established from these data were compared with previously published data in chimpanzees and gorillas and with those for humans and other closely related primate species.

Results The curves for the different hominids were very similar, while those for mandrills more closely resembled baboons and data for patas monkeys were comparable to those for macaques.

Conclusions These data, by providing a tool to evaluate precise gestational age, will be useful for centers raising these four primate species."
Size and shape dimorphism in great ape mandibles and implications for fossil species recognition,"['Taylor, AB', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20266,JAN 2006,17,"Sexual dimorphism is an important source of morphological variation, and species differences in dimorphism may be reflected in magnitude, pattern, or both. While the extant great apes are commonly used as a reference sample for distinguishing between sexual dimorphism and intertaxic variation in the fossil record, few studies have evaluated mandibular dimorphism in these taxa. In this study, percentage, degree, and pattern of mandibular dimorphism are evaluated in Pongo, Gorilla, and Pan. Mandibular dimorphism patterns are explored to determine the extent to which such patterns accurately track great ape phylogeny. Pattern stability is assessed to determine whether there are stable patterns of mandibular size and shape dimorphism that may be usefully applied to hominoid or hominid fossil species recognition studies. Finally, the established patterns of dimorphism are used to address recent debates surrounding great ape taxonomy. Results demonstrate that mandibular dimorphism is universally expressed in size, but only Pongo and Gorilla exhibit shape dimorphism. Pattern similarity tends to be greater between subspecies of the same species than between higher-order taxa, suggesting that within the great apes, there is a relationship between dimorphism pattern and phylogeny. However, this relationship is not exact, given that dimorphism patterns are weakly correlated between some closely related taxa, while great ape subspecies may be highly correlated with taxa belonging to other species or genera. Furthermore, dimorphism patterns are not significantly correlated between great ape genera, even between Gorilla and Pan. Dimorphism patterns are more stable in Gorilla and Pongo as compared to Pan, but there is little pattern stability between species or genera. Importantly, few variables differ significantly between taxa that simultaneously show consistently relatively low levels of dimorphism and low levels of variation within taxa. Combined, these findings indicate that mandibular dimorphism patterns can and do vary considerably, even among closely related species, and suggest that it would be difficult to employ great ape mandibular dimorphism patterns for purposes of distinguishing between intra- and interspecies variation in fossil samples. Finally, the degree of pattern similarity in mandibular dimorphism is lower than previously observed by others for craniofacial dimorphism. Thus, the possibility cannot be ruled out that patterns of craniofacial dimorphism in great apes may be associated with a stronger phylogenetic signal than are patterns of mandibular dimorphism."

This study examined patterns of space use by 14 gorillas and six chimpanzees housed in similar non-naturalistic environments at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, IL. The location of each individual was recorded in relation to elements of the environment over a two-year period. These data were compared to volumetric measurements of the enclosures to determine ""preferences"" for particular environmental elements. Chimpanzees preferred the highest tier of the enclosure and the gorillas preferred the floor level. Both species showed preferences for doorways, corners and the mesh barriers adjacent to keeper areas. These data supplement data from wild populations of apes and provide information useful for those seeking to design new ape enclosures or renovate existing facilities. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The human PCDH11X/Y gene pair is located in the non-pseudoautosomal X-Y homologous region (Xq21.3/Yp11.2). The possible existence of PCDH11 gene dosage differences between human and non-human primates is of evolutionary significance with respect to species differences and escape from X inactivation, and has been repeatedly debated. Previous investigations on the X/Y homologous status of PCDH11 and adjacent sequences in non-human primates have highlighted the complexity of the molecular pattern and evolutionary history of this genomic region. This paper provides for the first time direct evidence for the absence of the PCDH11 gene from the Y chromosome of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) as well as gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). By confirming the suspected lack of X-Y homologous status for PCDH11 in non-human primates, our results reinforce the hypothesis of a hominid-specific role for this gene in brain development.

Moreover, we found evidence at hand for different types of heterochromatin in the chimpanzee genome. Finally, shedding new light on the human/chimpanzee speciation, karyotypes of three members of the genus Pan were studied by mMCB and no cytogenetic differences were found although the phylogenetic distance between these subspecies is suggested to be 2.5 million years.

A contact algorithm for density-based load estimation,"['Bona, MA', 'Martin, LD', 'Fischer, KJ']",JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2005.01.006,2006,5,"An algorithm, which includes contact interactions within a joint, has been developed to estimate the dominant loading patterns in joints based on the density distribution of bone. The algorithm is applied to the proximal femur of a chimpanzee, gorilla and grizzly bear and is compared to the results obtained in a companion paper that uses a non-contact (linear) version of the density-based load estimation method. Results from the contact algorithm are consistent with those from the linear method. While the contact algorithm is substantially more complex than the linear method, it has some added benefits. First, since contact between the two interacting surfaces is incorporated into the load estimation method, the pressure distributions selected by the method are more likely indicative of those found in vivo. Thus, the pressure distributions predicted by the algorithm are more consistent with the in vivo loads that were responsible for producing the given distribution of bone density. Additionally, the relative positions of the interacting bones are known for each pressure distribution selected by the algorithm. This should allow the pressure distributions to be related to specific types of activities. The ultimate goal is to develop a technique that can predict dominant joint loading patterns and relate these loading patterns to specific types of locomotion and/or activities.

"How the great apes (Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, Pan paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla) perform on the reversed contingency task: The effects of food quantity and food visibility","['Vlamings, PHJM', 'Uher, J', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-ANIMAL BEHAVIOR PROCESSES,10.1037/0097-7403.32.1.60,JAN 2006,41,"S. T. Boysen and G. G. Berntson (1995) found that chimpanzees performed poorly on a reversed contingency task in which they had to point to the smaller of 2 food quantities to acquire the larger quantity. The authors compared the performance of 4 great ape species (Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, Pan paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla) on the reversed contingency task while manipulating food quantity (0-4 or 1-4) and food visibility (visible pairs or covered pairs). Results showed no systematic species differences but large individual differences. Some individuals of each species were able to solve the reversed contingency task. Both quantity and visibility of the food items had a significant effect on performance. Subjects performed better when the disparity between quantities was smaller and the quantities were not directly visible."
Dental microwear and diets of African early Homo,"['Ungar, PS', 'Grine, FE', 'Teaford, MF', 'El Zaatari, S']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.08.007,JAN 2006,50,"Conventional wisdom ties the origin and early evolution of the genus Homo to environmental changes that occurred near the end of the Pliocene. The basic idea is that changing habitats led to new diets emphasizing savanna resources, such as herd mammals or underground storage organs. Fossil teeth provide the most direct evidence available for evaluating this theory. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of dental microwear in Plio-Pleistocene Homo from Africa. We examined all available cheek teeth from Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, and South Africa and found 18 that preserved antemortem microwear. Microwear features were measured and compared for these specimens and a baseline series of five extant primate species (Cebus apella, Gorilla gorilla, Lophocebus albigena, Pan troglodytes, and Papio ursinus) and two protohistoric human foraging groups (Aleut and Arikara) with documented differences in diet and subsistence strategies. Results confirmed that dental microwear reflects diet, such that hard-object specialists tend to have more large microwear pits, whereas tough food eaters usually have more striations and smaller microwear features. Early Homo specimens clustered with baseline groups that do not prefer fracture resistant foods. Still, Homo erectus and individuals from Swartkrans Member I had more small pits than Homo habilis and specimens from Sterkfontein Member 5C. These results suggest that none of the early Homo groups specialized on very hard or tough foods, but that H. erectus and Swartkrans Member 1 individuals ate, at least occasionally, more brittle or tough items than other fossil hominins studied.

Inventory of large and medium-sized mammals in south-western Cameroon,"['Matthews, A', 'Matthews, A']",MAMMALIA,10.1515/MAMM.2006.041,2006,0,"The results of an inventory of large and medium-sized mammals in the Campo and Ma'an Forests in southwestern Cameroon are presented. In 24 months between 1997 and 2000, observations of live animals, tracks, faeces and night nests of apes were recorded on a total of 665.5 km of line transects. The presence of 33 species, including 12 diurnal and three nocturnal primate species, eight ungulates and five carnivores, was confirmed. Hunters confirmed the occurrence of 15 additional species. In the Campo Forest, the species diversity and density of most mammals were higher than in the Ma'an Forest, although a large part of the Campo Forest has been logged. Only three guenon species and chimpanzees were found at the same or even higher densities in the as yet unlogged Ma'an Forest. Gorillas, elephants, buffaloes and mangabeys were extremely rare in the Ma'an Forest. High hunting pressure in the Ma'an Forest seems to have led to a drastic population decline for most species. In the Campo Forest, mammal densities were lower in the northern and western parts of the area subjected to high levels of habitat destruction by logging and hunting than in the less exploited southern and eastern areas of the logging concession and within the National Park."

The role of taste in food selection by African apes: implications for niche separation and overlap in tropical forests,"['Remis, MJ']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-005-0145-9,JAN 2006,7,"Ripe fruit eating shapes the behavior of most of the apes. Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are very different sizes and, consequently, have been traditionally viewed as ecologically distinct, but few studies have explored the behavioral and physiological foundations of their diets. Debate continues on the extent that large-bodied gorillas may be less selective and more opportunistic fruit eaters than chimpanzees. Taste responses have been predicted to relate to body size and digestive strategies. This study employs laboratory research on taste perception and discrimination among captive zoo-housed chimpanzees and relates it to previous work on gorillas to better characterize diets and niche separation among these apes. During the captive trials, differences were recorded in consumption patterns of water and varying concentrations of dilute aqueous fructose (sweet), and tannic acid solutions (astringent), compounds commonly found in wild foods. The chimpanzees exhibited similar preference thresholds for fructose (50 mM) to other primates studied. They exhibited slightly lower inhibition thresholds for tannic acid solutions than gorillas, but higher than smaller primates studied to date. These preliminary findings suggest that tannin tolerance may well be mediated by body size, though possible species differences in salivary proteins or other sensory differences remain to be explored. This research furthers our efforts to understand the roles of body size and physiological adaptations in shaping diet and niche separation of chimpanzees and gorillas."
"Is the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes an endangered species? It depends on what ""endangered"" means","['Oates, JF']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-005-0149-5,JAN 2006,25,"I review information on the status in the wild of the robust chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, and consider whether this evidence is consistent with the designation of P. troglodytes as Endangered in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List, and with public statements to the effect that great apes as a whole will be extinct within a few decades. Chimpanzees remain widespread in tropical Africa, occurring in a variety of forested habitats. Estimates of total surviving numbers have increased from about 200,000 in the 1980s to a maximum of almost 300,000 in 2003. However, this apparent increase comes about from new survey data, rather than representing a measured increase in actual population numbers. Infectious disease decimated several chimpanzee populations during the 1990s, and data from parts of Gabon, extrapolated to that country as a whole, suggest a major decline in great ape populations caused by disease and hunting. However, accurate data on population numbers are absent for the majority of wild chimpanzee Populations. I found reports of the presence of Pan troglodytes in at least 51 national parks in at least 19 countries; some of these parks have been established very recently. Chimpanzees also occur in many non-park conservation areas. A set of large, well-protected parks could safeguard chimpanzees for the foreseeable future. Although many African parks do not function well at present, mechanisms to improve their function are understood and available. By a strict application of IUCN threat criteria, P. troglodytes can be considered Endangered, based on estimated rates of past decline and on the species' long generation time. Relatively speaking, however, P. troglodytes is less endangered than are orangutans or gorillas, and the species is unlikely to go extinct by the year 2100, especially if existing conservation measures improve. The IUCN threat-rating system has become overly complex; the system can produce results that do not accord with common sense and these results must therefore be interpreted with care."
Diet and seasonal changes in sympatric gorillas and chimpanzees at Kahuzi-Biega National Park,"['Yamagiwa, J', 'Basabose, AK']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-005-0147-7,JAN 2006,28,"Based on 8 years of observations of a group of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri) and a unit-group of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) living sympatrically in the montane forest at Kahuzi-Biega National Park, we compared their diet and analyzed dietary overlap between them in relation to fruit phenology. Data on fruit consumption were collected mainly from fecal samples, and phenology of preferred ape fruits was estimated by monitoring. Totals of 231 plant foods (116 species) and 137 plant foods (104 species) were recorded for gorillas and chimpanzees, respectively. Among these, 38% of gorilla foods and 64% of chimpanzee foods were eaten by both apes. Fruits accounted for the largest overlap between them (77% for gorillas and 59% for chimpanzees). Gorillas consumed more species of vegetative foods (especially bark) exclusively whereas chimpanzees consumed more species of fruits and animal foods exclusively. Although the number of fruit species available in the montane forest of Kahuzi is much lower than that in lowland forest, the number of fruit species per chimpanzee fecal sample (average 2.7 species) was similar to that for chimpanzees in the lowland habitats. By contrast, the number of fruit species per gorilla fecal sample (average 0.8 species) was much lower than that for gorillas in the lowland habitats. Fruit Consumption by both apes tended to increase during the dry season when ripe fruits were more abundant in their habitat. However, the number of fruit species consumed by chimpanzees did not change according to ripe fruit abundance. The species differences in fruit consumption may be attributed to the wide ranging of gorillas and repeated usage of a small range by chimpanzees and/or to avoidance of inter-specific contact by chimpanzees. The different staple foods (leaves and bark for gorillas and fig fruits for chimpanzees) characterize the dietary divergence between them in the montane forest of Kahuzi, where fruit is usually scarce. Gorillas rarely fed on insects, but chimpanzees occasionally fed on bees with honey, which possibly compensate for fruit scarcity. A comparison of dietary overlap between gorillas and chimpanzees across I habitats suggests that sympatry may not influence dietary overlap in fruit consumed but may stimulate behavioral divergence to reduce feeding competition between them."

Human specific AluY element was identified on human chromosome 21q22 (accession no. AL163282), and then that was a new member of AluYj subfamily. From the bio-informatic analysis, AluYj subfamily was investigated in human whole genome using AluYj4 consensus sequence (accession no. AL163282). Thirteen members of the AluYj4 elements (4 diagnostic mutations) and eight members of the AluYj3 elements (3 diagnostic mutations) were identified with distinct diagnostic mutation from AluY consensus sequence. The results of the molecular clock calculation of non-CpG region substitution indicated that, AluYj4 elements (2.1 million years old) may be proliferated more recent time than AluYj3 elements (14.1 million years old). For the verification of recent insertion time, four of AluYj4 elements (ch2-AC017101, ch10-AC044786, chl2-AC007656 and ch21-AL163282) from human chromosomes 2, 10, 12, 21 were analyzed by PCR amplification using various human and primate DNA samples. Though, no polymorphism was detected in human population, we identified the new AluYj4 subfamily as the human specific elements."

Dental microwear variability on buccal tooth enamel surfaces of extant catarrhini and the miocene fossil Dryopithecus laietanus (Hominoidea),"['Galbany, J', 'Moya-Sola, S', 'Perez-Perez, A']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000089531,2005,11,"Analyses of buccal tooth microwear have been used to trace dietary habits of modern hunter-gatherer populations. In these populations, the average density and length of striations on the buccal surfaces of teeth are significantly correlated with the abrasive potential of food items consumed. In non-human primates, tooth microwear patterns on both occlusal and buccal wear facets have been thoroughly studied and the results applied to the characterization of dietary habits of fossil species. In this paper, we present inter- and intra-specific buccal microwear variability analyses in extant Cercopithecoidea (Cercopithecus mitis, C. neglectus, Chlorocebus aethiops, Colobus spp., Papio anubis) and Hominoidea (Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus). The results are tentatively compared to buccal microwear patterns of the Miocene fossils Dryopithecus and Oreopithecus. Significant differences in striation density and length are found among the fossil taxa studied and the extant primates, suggesting that buccal microwear can be used to identify dietary differences among taxa. The Dryopithecus buccal microwear pattern most closely resembles that of abrasive, tough plant foods consumers, such as the gorilla, in contrast to studies of dental morphology that suggest a softer, frugivorous diet. Results for Oreopithecus were equivocal, but suggest a more abrasive diet than that previously thought."
Neural connectivity and cortical substrates of cognition in hominoids,"['Schenker, NM', 'Desgouttes, AM', 'Semendeferi, K']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.06.004,NOV 2005,55,"Cognitive functions and information processing recruit discrete neural systems in the cortex and white matter. We tested the idea that specific regions in the cerebrum are differentially enlarged in humans and that some of the neural reorganizational events that took place during hominoid evolution were species-specific and independent of changes in absolute brain size.

We used magnetic resonance images of the living brains of 10 human and 17 ape subjects to obtain volumetric estimates of regions of interest. We parcellated the white matter in the frontal and temporal lobes into two sectors, including the white matter immediately underlying the cortex (gyral white matter) and the rest of white matter (core). We outlined the dorsal, mesial, and orbital subdivisions of the frontal lobe and analyzed the relationship between cortex and gyral white matter within each subdivision.

For all regions analyzed, the observed human values are as large as expected, with the exception of the gyral white matter, which is larger than expected in humans. We found that orangutans had a relatively smaller orbital sector than any other great ape species, with no overlap in individual values. We found that the relative size of the dorsal subdivision is larger in chimpanzees than in bonobos, and that the ratio of gyral white matter to cortex stands out in Pan in comparison to Gorilla and Pongo. Individual variability, possible sex differences, and hemispheric asymmetries were present not only in humans, but in apes as well.

Differences in the distribution of neural connectivity and cortical sectors were identified among great ape species that share similar absolute brain sizes. Given that these regions are part of neural systems with distinct functional attributes, we suggest that the observed differences may reflect different evolutionary pressures on regulatory mechanisms of complex cognitive functions, including social cognition.

A 3D quantitative comparison of trapezium and trapezoid relative articular and nonarticular surface areas in modern humans and great apes,"['Tocheri, MW', 'Razdan, A', 'Williams, RC', 'Marzke, MW', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.06.005,NOV 2005,32,"The structure and functions of the modern human hand are critical components of what distinguishes Homo sapiens from the great apes (Gorilla, Pan, and Pongo). In this study, attention is focused on the trapezium and trapezoid, the two most lateral bones of the distal carpal row, in the four extant hominid genera, representing the first time they have been quantified and analyzed together as a morphological-functional complex. Our objective is to quantify the relative articular and nonarticular surface areas of these two bones and to test whether modern humans exhibit significant shape differences from the great apes, as predicted by previous qualitative analyses and the functional demands of differing manipulative and locomotor strategies. Modern humans were predicted to show larger relative first metacarpal and scaphoid surfaces on the trapezium because of the regular recruitment of the thumb during manipulative behaviors; alternatively, great apes were predicted to show larger relative second metacarpal and scaphoid surfaces on the trapezoid because of the functional demands on the hands during locomotor behaviors. Modern humans were also expected to exhibit larger relative mutual joint surfaces between the trapezoid and adjacent carpals than do the great apes because of assumed transverse loads generated by the functional demands of the modern human power grip. Using 3D bone models acquired through laser digitizing, the relative articular and nonarticular areas on each bone are quantified and compared. Multivariate analyses of these data clearly distinguish modern humans from the great apes. In total, the observed differences between modern humans and the great apes support morphological predictions based on the fact that this region of the human wrist is no longer involved in weight-bearing during locomotor behavior and is instead recruited solely for manipulative behaviors. The results provide the beginnings of a 3D comparative standard against which further extant and fossil primate wrist bones can be compared within the contexts of manipulative and locomotor behaviors.

Wave-like spread of Ebola Zaire,"['Walsh, PD', 'Biek, R', 'Real, LA']",PLOS BIOLOGY,10.1371/journal.pbio.0030371,NOV 2005,69,"In the past decade the Zaire strain of Ebola virus (ZEBOV) has emerged repeatedly into human populations in central Africa and caused massive die-offs of gorillas and chimpanzees. We tested the view that emergence events are independent and caused by ZEBOV variants that have been long resident at each locality. Phylogenetic analyses place the earliest known outbreak at Yambuku, Democratic Republic of Congo, very near to the root of the ZEBOV tree, suggesting that viruses causing all other known outbreaks evolved from a Yambuku-like virus after 1976. The tendency for earlier outbreaks to be directly ancestral to later outbreaks suggests that outbreaks are epidemiologically linked and may have occurred at the front of an advancing wave. While the ladder-like phylogenetic structure could also bear the signature of positive selection, our statistical power is too weak to reach a conclusion in this regard. Distances among outbreaks indicate a spread rate of about 50 km per year that remains consistent across spatial scales. Viral evolution is clocklike, and sequences show a high level of small-scale spatial structure. Genetic similarity decays with distance at roughly the same rate at all spatial scales. Our analyses suggest that ZEBOV has recently spread across the region rather than being long persistent at each outbreak locality. Controlling the impact of Ebola on wild apes and human populations may be more feasible than previously recognized."
First observation of tool use in wild gorillas,"['Breuer, T', 'Ndoundou-Hockemba, M', 'Fishlock, V']",PLOS BIOLOGY,10.1371/journal.pbio.0030380,NOV 2005,67,"Descriptions of novel tool use by great apes in response to different circumstances aids us in understanding the factors favoring the evolution of tool use in humans. This paper documents what we believe to be the first two observations of tool use in wild western gorillas ( Gorilla gorilla). We first observed an adult female gorilla using a branch as a walking stick to test water deepness and to aid in her attempt to cross a pool of water at Mbeli Bai, a swampy forest clearing in northern Congo. In the second case we saw another adult female using a detached trunk from a small shrub as a stabilizer during food processing. She then used the trunk as a self-made bridge to cross a deep patch of swamp. In contrast to information from other great apes, which mostly show tool use in the context of food extraction, our observations show that in gorillas other factors such as habitat type can stimulate the use of tools."

Recent findings indicated an increasing importance of AE for non-human primates living in regions endemic for E. multilocularis. The death of five cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and a lowland gorilla (Gorilla g. gorilla) due to A-E raised concern about the incidence of this parasite in the Basle Zoo. Consequently, a project was initiated to investigate the prevalence amongst an affected group of cynomolgus monkeys, as well as in foxes and mice. Three out of 46 monkeys were seropositive for E. multilocularis antigen. In two of these monkeys and in another three animals, which were seronegative, structures compatible with metacestodal cysts were observed using ultrasonography. Seven out of 35 free roaming foxes caught at the zoo were positive for an intestinal E. multilocularis copro-antigen ELISA, four of them shed taeniid eggs simultaneously. No lesions compatible with AE were present in 50 necropsied mice from the zoo area. These results indicate that the fox population is a potential source to introduce E. multilocularis and may thus represent a risk for the zoo animals."

The International Gorilla Conservation Programme working with the protected area authorities in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo has developed a ranger based monitoring system, using basic protocols for data collection that guide protected area staff in park management. This programme is a key management tool for the three park authorities responsible for the conservation of the mountain gorilla ( Gorilla beringei beringei) in the Virunga and Bwindi forest blocks. The programme was initiated in 1997 and has enabled the gathering of extensive information on illegal activities, key species of fauna and. ora, and habituated and unhabituated groups of gorillas. Ranger based monitoring is a simple and cost effective tool that can be sustained in the parks in the Virunga-Bwindi region with limited external support. It provides park managers with information that prompts appropriate responses to threats to the ecosystem. For example information on the distribution of illegal activities determines targeted patrol coverage to address specific threats. The bottom-up approach of ranger based monitoring includes a strong capacity building component and empowers field staff in park management activities."

Principal component analysis indicated that human activities significantly influence the distribution of large mammals, even within this protected area. Distance from the village and the main road as well as the distance from secondary roads appeared to have the greatest influence. Elephants in particular were significantly less common in areas related to human use. Our study showed that poachers use roads, both primary and secondary, to penetrate into the National Park. Thus increasing anti-poaching efforts along these roads could be an effective protection measure."

Independent intrachromosomal recombination events underlie the pericentric inversions of chimpanzee and gorilla chromosomes homologous to human chromosome 16,"['Goidts, V', 'Szamalek, JM', 'de Jong, PJ', 'Cooper, DN', 'Chuzhanova, N', 'Hameister, H', 'Kehrer-Sawatzki, H']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.3732505,SEP 2005,27,"Analyses of chromosomal rearrangements that have occurred during the evolution of the hominoids can reveal much about the mutational mechanisms underlying primate chromosome evolution. We characterized the breakpoints of the pericentric inversion of chimpanzee chromosome 18 (PTR XVI), which is homologous to human chromosome 16 (HSA 16). A conserved 23 similar to kb inverted repeat composed of satellites, LINE and Alu elements was identified near the breakpoints and could have mediated the inversion by bringing the chromosomal arms into close proximity with each other, thereby facilitating intrachromosomal recombination. The exact positions of the breakpoints may then have been determined by local DNA sequence homologies between the inversion breakpoints, including a 22-base pair direct repeat. The similarly located pericentric inversion of gorilla (GGO) chromosome XVI, was studied by FISH and PCR analysis. The p- and q-arm breakpoints of the inversions in PTR XVI and GGO XVI were found to occur at slightly different locations, consistent with their independent origin. Further, FISH studies of the homologous chromosomal regions in macaque and orangutan revealed that the region represented by HSA BAC RP11-696PI9, which spans the inversion breakpoint on HSA 16qll-12, was derived from the ancestral primate chromosome homologous to HSA 1. After the divergence of orangutan from the other great apes -12 million years ago (Mya), a duplication of the corresponding region occurred followed by its interchromosomal transposition to the ancestral chromosome l6q. Thus, the most parsimonious interpretation is that the gorilla and chimpanzee homologs exhibit similar but nonidentical derived pericentric inversions, whereas HSA 16 represents the ancestral form among hominoids."

These haplotypes appear to have been evolving almost independently for tens of millions of years. By complete resequencing of 20 haplotypes across the similar to 100-kbp region that spans the HLA-DQA1, -DQB1, and -DRB1 genes, we provide a detailed view of the way in which the genome structure at this locus has been shaped by the interplay of selection, gene-gene interaction, and recombination."
Optimal storage conditions for highly dilute DNA samples: A role for trehalose as a preserving agent,"['Smith, S', 'Morin, PA']",JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES,NA,SEP 2005,24,"DNA extraction from trace samples or noninvasively collected samples often results in the recovery of low concentration solutions of DNA that are prone to DNA degradation or other loss. Because of the difficulty in obtaining such samples, and their potentially high value in wildlife and forensic studies, it is critical that optimal methods are employed for their long-term storage. We assessed the amplification yield of samples kept under different storage conditions with the addition of potential preserving agents. We stored dilutions of known concentration human placental DNA, and gorilla fecal DNA, under four conditions (+4 degrees C, -20 degrees C, -80 degrees C, dry at room temperature), and with three additives (Tris EDTA (TE) buffer, Hind III digested Lambda DNA, trehalose). The effectiveness of the treatment methods was tested at regular intervals using qPCR to assess the quantity of amplifiable DNA, and a PCR assay of a larger 757 by fragment to evaluate the quality of that remaining DNA. The highest quantity of DNA remained in samples stored at -80 degrees C, regardless of storage additives, and those dried at room temperature in the presence of trehalose. Surprisingly, DNA was best preserved in the presence of trehalose, either dried or at -80 degrees C; significant quality loss occurred with -20 degrees C and +4 degrees C storage."

Bilateral ophthalmic examinations of western lowland gorillas (n = 5) while under general anesthesia were performed opportunistically, including slit-lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundus examination, cycloplegic retinoscopy, Schiotz tonometry, corneal diameter and thickness measurements, A-scan and B-scan ultrasonography, keratometry, and cultures of the eyelid margins and bulbar conjunctiva. Mean spherical equivalent refractive error by cycloplegic retinoscopy was +1.20 +/- 0.59 diopters. Mean intraocular pressure by Schiotz tonometry was 12.0 +/- 4.3 mm Hg. Mean optic nerve head cup to disc ratio was 0.42 +/- 0.11. Mean horizontal corneal diameter was 13.4 +/- 0.8 mm, and mean vertical cornea diameter was 12.7 +/- 0.8 mm. Mean central corneal thickness by ultrasound pachymetry was 489 +/- 52 mu m. Mean axial length of the eye by A-scan was 22.75 +/- 0.71 mm. Mean lens thickness by A-scan was 4.23 +/- 0.34 mm. Mean anterior chamber depth by A-scan was 4.00 +/- 0.26 mm. Mean keratometry reading was 44.38 +/- 1.64 diopters. Eyelid margin and bulbar conjunctival cultures isolated Candida sp.

This study suggests important similarities between western lowland gorilla and human eyes. These similarities may allow diagnostics, techniques, and equipment for human eye surgery, such as those used for cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation, to be successfully utilized for gorillas."

Non-invasive fecal hormone analysis and behavioral observations for monitoring stress responses in captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Peel, AJ', 'Vogelnest, L', 'Finnigan, M', 'Grossfeldt, L', ""O'Brien, JK""]",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/ZOO.20055,SEP-OCT 2005,13,"Non-invasive techniques for monitoring the stress response in captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) were investigated. Fecal samples for cortisol measurement and concurrent behavioral data were collected from six individuals in a socially housed gorilla group (one adult male, three adult females and their three offspring) over a 7-month period. Despite inter-individual variation in the dynamics of fecal cortisol concentrations over time, several major secretory peaks coincided across individuals. High cortisol concentrations in feces were correlated with induced stressors or behavioral observations indicating high social tension, with a 1-2 day lag period. Entry progression order of the gorillas into a den complex and a supplant-based dominance index were suitable indicators of overall dominance hierarchies, and fluctuations over time reflected periods of instability. Diurnal variation in fecal cortisol was not apparent when comparing afternoon and morning samples, however the sample collection interval was relatively short (3-5 hr). These results demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring stress responses based on the dynamics of both fecal cortisol excretion and behavior. This non-invasive approach may be used for gauging responses to"
Flow cytometric sorting of fresh and frozen-thawed spermatozoa in the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"[""O'Brien, JK"", 'Stojanov, T', 'Crichton, EG', 'Evans, KM', 'Leigh, D', 'Maxwell, WMC', 'Evans, G', 'Loskutoff, NM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20158,AUG 2005,12,"We adapted flow cytometry technology for high-purity sorting of X chromosome-bearing spermatozoa in the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Our objectives were to develop methodologies for liquid storage of semen prior to sorting, sorting of liquid-stored and frozen-thawed spermatozoa, and assessment of sorting accuracy. In study 1, the in vitro sperm characteristics of gorilla ejaculates from one male were unchanged (P > 0.05) after 8 hr of liquid storage at 15 degrees C in a non-egg yolk diluent (HEPES-buffered modified Tyrode's medium). In study 2, we examined the efficacy of sorting fresh and frozen-thawed spermatozoa using human spermatozoa as a model for gorilla spermatozoa. Ejaculates from one male were split into fresh and frozen aliquots. X-enriched samples derived from both fresh and frozen-thawed human semen were of high purity, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; 90.7%+/- 2.3%, overall), and contained a high proportion of morphologically normal spermatozoa (86.0%+/- 1.0%, overall). In study 3, we processed liquid-stored semen from two gorillas for sorting using a modification of methods for human spermatozoa. The sort rate. for enrichment of X-bearing spermatozoa was 7.3+2.5 spermatozoa per second. The X-enriched samples were of high purity (single-sperm PCR: 83.7%) and normal morphology (79.0%+/- 3.9%). In study 4 we examined frozen-thawed gorilla semen, and the sort rate (8.3 +/- 2.9 X-bearing sperm/sec), purity (89.7%), and normal morphology (81.4%+/- 3.4%) were comparable to those of liquid-stored semen. Depending on the male and the type of sample used (fresh or frozen-thawed), 0.8-2.2% of gorilla spermatozoa in the processed ejaculate were present in the X-enriched sample. These results demonstrate that fresh or frozen-thawed gorilla spermatozoa can be flow cytometrically sorted into samples enriched for X-bearing spermatozoa."
Genetic diversity among African great apes based on mitochondrial DNA sequences,"['Guillen, AKZ', 'Barrett, GM', 'Takenaka, O']",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,10.1007/s10531-004-4781-y,AUG 2005,8,"The mitochondrial DNA D-Loop region was sequenced, analyzed and used as a molecular marker for populations of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), bonobo (P. paniscus) and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla and G. beringei), and also compared with data previously reported for these taxa. In Gorilla, a main disjunction between western (G. gorilla) and eastern (G. beringei, including G. b. graueri) species was observed, as well as high mitochondrial diversity within the western species. The genetic distance values within G. gorilla (0.14) were higher than those between subspecies (eastern lowland and mountain 0.12). Likewise, values of genetic diversity within this species (0.05) were higher than those between species (western and eastern lowland gorilla 0.04). Similarly, in genus Pan a main differentiation between western (P. t. verus) and central forms (P. t. troglodytes and P. t. schweinfurthii) was observed. The obtained values of genetic distance and genetic diversity revealed that the central subspecies are closer to each other than either of them is to the western one, while bonobos composed a distinct clade that expresses a well-defined specific identity. The current distribution, phylogeny and levels of genetic diversity in African great ape populations are consistent with the hypothesis that Pleistocene climatic events led to cyclical periods of isolation in forest refugia followed by expansion and dispersal. The implications of this high level of genetic diversity for taxonomic classification, wildlife management and conservation are discussed."
Evaluating the steady state assumption: Simulations of gorilla nest decay,"['Walsh, PD', 'White, LJT']",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,10.1890/03-5283,AUG 2005,20,"Large mammal surveys are often based on indices of animal abundance such as dung or, for great apes, sleeping nests. They also tend to rely on the ""steady state"" assumption that the rate at which an index is deposited in the environment is exactly balanced by the rate at which it disappears (decays). Here we use a data set on western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) sleeping nest decay rates to show that this assumption is likely to be strongly violated often and in ways that have serious implications for our ability to accurately survey and monitor a wide range of endangered species, particularly in tropical forests. We first fit the data using a model describing the daily probability of nest decay as a function of nest age. and monthly rainfall. We then use this decay model to simulate time series of gorilla nest standing stock, given observed rainfall regimes from a series of sites in the equatorial African country of Gabon. These simulations suggest that, within a given site, the relationship between nest standing stock and true gorilla density fluctuates wildly and is, on average, tens of percent away from the mean nest decay time for the empirical data set. The behavior of nest standing stock is extremely sensitive to variability in rainfall, not just annual mean rainfall. Differences between sites in rainfall variability produce counterintuitive differences between sites in nest standing stock. Multiyear trends in the mean and variance of rainfall produce the spurious impression of trends in animal abundance. Furthermore, heterogeneity in rainfall exists at all spatial and temporal scales, so that attempts to use regression models based on rainfall measurements taken at one location or time are not likely to accurately predict the nest decay regime at other places or times. We close with some suggestions on alternative estimation methods that do not rely on extrapolations of environmental conditions from one time or place to another."

The majority of gorillas did not reliably select the larger quantity in Experiment I until receiving training to do so in Experiment 2. Experiment 3 evaluated their ability to select the larger of 2 pairs of quantities. All gorillas selected the larger pair more often than chance, and the old were less accurate and slower than were the young. For most gorillas, performance in relative numerousness judgment with training and summation was comparable with previous reports in chimpanzees and orangutans."

We studied the occurrence of various forms of arthritis to examine possible nature/nurture causality. The macerated skeletons of 38 G. beringei and 99 G. gorilla individuals were examined macroscopically for the presence of articular and osseous pathologies. Contrasting with only isolated osteoarthritis and infectious arthritis was the frequent occurrence of a form of erosive arthritis associated with joint fusion. Twenty-one percent of the G. beringei and 20% of G. gorilla specimens were afflicted, which are statistically indistinguishable frequencies. While both had prominent axial disease, they differed in patterns of peripheral arthritis. Whereas G. beringei showed a pauciarticular pattern, the pattern in G. gorilla was more often polyarticular. Susceptibility to spondyloarthropathy was apparently genetically imprinted before Gorilla separated into G. gorilla and G. beringei. However, the different patterns of peripheral joint involvement suggest a causality resulting from lifestyle (e.g., the presence/absence or extent of knuckle walking) or a habitat-related infectious agent."
Primates and the ecology of their infectious diseases: How will anthropogenic change affect host-parasite interactions?,"['Chapman, CA', 'Gillespie, TR', 'Goldberg, TL']",EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/evan.20068,JUL-AUG 2005,85,"The sudden appearance of diseases like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome(1)), the devastating impacts of diseases like Ebola on both human and wildlife communities,(2,3) and the immense social and economic costs created by viruses like HIV4 underscore our need to understand the ecology of infectious diseases. Given that monkeys and apes often share parasites with humans, understanding the ecology of infectious diseases in nonhuman primates is of paramount importance. This is well illustrated by the HIV viruses, the causative agents of human AIDS, which evolved recently from related viruses of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys(5)), as well as by the outbreaks of Ebola virus, which trace their origins to zoonotic transmissions from local apes.(6) A consideration of how environmental change may promote contact between humans and nonhuman primates and thus increase the possibility of sharing infectious diseases detrimental to humans or nonhuman primates is now paramount in conservation and human health planning."

Mountain gorilla tug-of-war: Silverbacks have limited control over reproduction in multimale groups,"['Bradley, BJ', 'Robbins, MM', 'Williamson, EA', 'Steklis, HD', 'Steklis, NG', 'Eckhardt, N', 'Boesch, C', 'Vigilant, L']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0502019102,JUN 28 2005,80,"To determine who fathers the offspring in wild mountain gorilla groups containing more than one adult male silverback, we genotyped nearly one-fourth (n = 92) of the mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) living in the Virunga Volcanoes region of Africa. Paternity analysis of 48 offspring born into four groups between 1985 and 1999 revealed that, although all infants were sired by within-group males, the socially dominant silverback did not always monopolize reproduction within his group. Instead, the second-ranking male sired an average of 15 % of group offspring. This result, in combination with previous findings that second-ranking males fare best by not leaving the group but by staying and waiting to assume dominance even if no reproduction is possible while waiting, is not consistent with expectations from a reproductive skew model in which the silverback concedes controllable reproduction to the second-ranking male. Instead, the data suggest a ""tug-of-war"" scenario in which neither the dominant nor the second-ranking male has full control over his relative reproductive share. The two top-ranked males were typically unrelated and this, in combination with the mixed paternity of group offspring, means that multimale gorilla groups do not approximate family groups. Instead, as long-term assemblages of related and unrelated individuals, gorilla groups are similar to chimpanzee groups and so offer interesting possibilities for kin-biased interactions among individuals."
Variation in hominoid molar enamel thickness,"['Smith, TM', 'Olejniczak, AJ', 'Martin, LB', 'Reid, DJ']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.02.004,JUN 2005,50,"Enamel thickness has figured prominently in discussions of hominid origins for nearly a century, although little is known about its intra-taxon variation. It has been suggested that enamel thickness increases from first to third molars, perhaps due to varying functional demands or developmental constraints, but this has not been tested with appropriate statistical methods. We quantified enamel cap area (c), dentine area (b), and enamel-dentine junction length (c) in coronal planes of sections through the mesial and distal cusps in 57 permanent molars of Pan and 59 of Pongo, and calculated average (c/e) and relative enamel thickness (([c/e]/root b) * 100). Posteriorly increasing or decreasing trends in each variable and average (AET) and relative enamel thickness (RET) were tested among molars in the same row. Differences between maxillary and mandibular analogues and between mesial and distal sections of the same tooth were also examined. In mesial sections of both genera, enamel cap area significantly increased posteriorly, except in Pan maxillary sections. In distal sections of maxillary teeth, trends of decreasing dentine area were significant in both taxa, possibly due to hypocone reduction. Significant increases in AET and RET posteriorly were found in all comparisons, except for AET in Pongo distal maxillary sections. Several significant differences were found between maxillary and mandibular analogues in both taxa. Relative to their mesial counterparts, distal sections showed increased enamel cap area and/or decreased dentine area, and thus increased AET and RET. This study indicates that when AET and RET are calculated from samples of mixed molars, variability is exaggerated due to the lumping of tooth types. To maximize taxonomic discrimination using enamel thickness, tooth type and section plane should be taken into account. Nonetheless, previous findings that African apes have relatively thinner enamel than Pongo is supported for certain molar positions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Individuals from all species reliably followed the human's gaze direction and sometimes even checked back when they found no target. In a 2nd experiment, the human looked behind some kind of barrier. Results showed that individuals from all species reliably put themselves in places from which they could see what the experimenter was looking at behind the barrier.

Episodic-like memory in a gorilla: A review and new findings,"['Schwartz, BL', 'Hoffman, ML', 'Evans, S']",LEARNING AND MOTIVATION,10.1016/j.lmot.2005.02.012,MAY 2005,29,"The current paper examines if gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) possess an episodic memory system. Episodic memory, in humans, is a neurocognitive system that stores information about the personal past. Unique to episodic memory is its palinscopic or past-focused orientation; most memory systems serve to provide the organism with up to date knowledge of the current state of the world. We review four operational definitions that have been used to address issues of episodic memory in non-humans and review the literature with a focus on the studies previously done on gorillas. We describe two new studies with King, an adult male western lowland gorilla. We show that King can remember the order of past events (Experiment 1) and that King can remember where events occurred (Experiment 2). We conclude by discussing alternate explanations of our findings and speculate on future directions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Horizontal transmissions between species have been proposed, but little evidence exists for such events in the human/great ape lineage of evolution. Based on analysis of finished BAC chimpanzee genome sequence, we characterize a retroviral element (Pan troglodytes endogenous retrovirus 1 [PTERV1]) that has become integrated in the germline of African great ape and Old World monkey species but is absent from humans and Asian ape genomes. We unambiguously map 287 retroviral integration sites and determine that approximately 95.8% of the insertions occur at non-orthologous regions between closely related species. Phylogenetic analysis of the endogenous retrovirus reveals that the gorilla and chimpanzee elements share a monophyletic origin with a subset of the Old World monkey retroviral elements, but that the average sequence divergence exceeds neutral expectation for a strictly nuclear inherited DNA molecule. Within the chimpanzee, there is a significant integration bias against genes, with only 14 of these insertions mapping within intronic regions. Six out of ten of these genes, for which there are expression data, show significant differences in transcript expression between human and chimpanzee. Our data are consistent with a retroviral infection that bombarded the genomes of chimpanzees and gorillas independently and concurrently, 3-4 million years ago. We speculate on the potential impact of such recent events on the evolution of humans and great apes."

These sequences, the oldest reported fossil primate protein sequences, are of bone osteocalcin, which was extracted and sequenced by using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Through a combination of direct sequencing and peptide mass mapping, we determined that Neanderthals have an osteocalcin amino acid sequence that is identical to that of modern humans. We also report complete osteocalcin sequences for chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and a partial sequence for orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), all of which are previously unreported. We found that the osteocalcin sequences of Neanderthals, modern human, chimpanzee, and orangutan are unusual among mammals in that the ninth amino acid is proline (Pro-9), whereas most species have hydroxyproline (Hyp-9). Posttranslational hydroxylation of Pro-9 in osteocalcin by prolyl-4-hydroxylase requires adequate concentrations of vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid), molecular O-2, Fe2+, and 2-oxoglutarate, and also depends on enzyme recognition of the target proline substrate consensus sequence Leu-Gly-Ala-Pro-9-Ala-Pro-Tyr occurring in most mammals. in five species with Pro-9-Val-10, hydroxylation is blocked, whereas in gorilla there is a mixture of Pro-9 and Hyp-9. We suggest that the absence of hydroxylation of Pro-9 in Pan, Pongo, and Homo may reflect response to a selective pressure related to a decline in vitamin C in the diet during omnivorous dietary adaptation, either independently or through the common ancestor of these species."

In this article, I review a recent wave of comparative studies conducted with similar methodologies and similar theoretical frameworks on how two core components of human cognition - object permanence and gaze following - develop in different species. These comparative findings call for an integration of current competing accounts of developmental change. They further suggest that evolution has produced developmental devices capable at the same time of preserving core adaptive components, and opening themselves up to further adaptive change, not only in interaction with the external environment, but also in interaction with other co-developing cognitive systems."

To analyse the polymorphisms of these almost identical regions, it resulted mandatory to identify the presence of divergent sequences, in order to select distinctive primers for specific PCR genomic amplifications. To this aim, we first compared the two entire IgH3'ECs in silicio, utilising the updated GenBank (GB) contigs, then we analysed the two IgH3'ECs by cloning and sequencing amplicons from independent genomes. In silicio analysis showed that several inversions, deletions and short insertions had occurred after the duplication. We analysed in detail, by sequencing specific regions, the polymorphisms occurring in enhancer HS1,2-A (which lies in IgH3'EC-1, 3' to the C alpha-1 gene) and in enhancer HS1,2-B (which lies in IgH3'EC-2, 3' to C alpha-2). Polymorphisms are due to the repetition (occurring one to four times) of a 38-bp sequence present at the 3' of the core of enhancers HS1,2. The structure of both human HS1,2 enhancers has revealed not yet described polymorphic features due to the presence of variable spacer elements separating the 38-bp repetitions and to variable external elements bordering the repetition cluster. We found that one of the external elements gave rise to a divergent allele 3 in the two clusters. The frequency of the different alleles of the two loci varies in the Italian population and allele 3 of both loci are very rare. The analysis of the Callicebus moloch, Gorilla gorilla and Pan troglodytes HS1,2 enhancers showed the transformation from the ancestral structure with the 31- to the 17-by external element in hominids.

The relevance of the polymorphisms in the HS1,2 enhancers is due to the variable number of binding sites for the transcription factors: NF-kappa B, CMYB, BSAP1/2, AP1/4, E47, MyoD and mu E5 and thus to the possible influence of these variations on switch, production of Ig and on maturation of B cells.

Survey of stereotypic behavior in prosimians,"['Tarou, LR', 'Bloomsmith, MA', 'Maple, TL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20107,FEB 2005,15,"Captive animals have been observed to perform a variety of stereotypic behaviors. However, little is known about stereotypic behavior in prosimians. We sent surveys to 96 AZA-accredited institutions to examine stereotypic behavior in these primates. Forty-eight surveys were returned, providing information on 440 individuals of 10 genera. According to the responses, 13.2% of the prosimians surveyed exhibited some form of stereotypic behavior. Pacing was the most common behavior. A logistic regression was used to examine intrinsic characteristics that might influence the performance of stereotypic behavior. The genus of the prosimian was a significant predictor of stereotypic behavior. Individuals of the genus Varecia and Microcebus were more likely to engage in stereotypic behavior than members of the other genera. Rearing history, age, and sex were not significant predictors of stereotypic behavior. To examine the influence of extrinsic variables on stereotypic behavior, we transformed the data into the percentage of individuals within the enclosure that were reported to exhibit stereotypic behavior, and analyzed them at the enclosure level using a general linear model (GLM) analysis of variance (ANOVA). The only environmental variable that significantly predicted stereotypic behavior was the frequency with which enrichment was provided. Frequent enrichment was provided to those exhibits with a higher percentage of prosimians that engaged in stereotypic behavior. The results of this survey suggest that stereotypic behavior in prosimians may be associated with intrinsic factors (i.e., individual or genus differences) in addition to extrinsic factors related to housing. This knowledge may be helpful in identifying the causes of and effective treatments for stereotypic behavior in prosimians. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
How does the zoo environment affect the behaviour of captive primates?,"['Hosey, GR']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2004.08.015,FEB 2005,70,"It is important for us to be able to understand the behaviour of primates in zoos for at least three reasons: firstly as a means towards ensuring their welfare. secondly to use that understanding to ensure a positive zoo experience for zoo visitors, and thirdly so that results of basic research undertaken on zoo primates can be properly evaluated. Often, however. the results of studies of how the zoo environment affects primate behaviour are not easy to interpret. We should recognize that the zoo environment is only one of a number of environments in which primates live. and should identify in which ways the zoo environment is different from those other environments. Here, it is suggested that the zoo environment may be defined in terms of three dimensions: regular presence of tame. numbers of unfamiliar humans, restricted space, and being managed. Individually all three of these can also be found in other. non-zoo environments, but all three together are characteristic of zoo environments. This paper is an initial attempt to compare studies of primate responses to the variables associated with each of these three dimensions across different primate environments. It is concluded that there is a need for at least two different types of study in future: comparisons across a range of primate environments using the same species and measures. and studies of the interactions between the three dimensions identified for zoo environments.

Preliminary comparisons of male/male interactions within bachelor and breeding groups of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Pullen, PK']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2004.08.016,FEB 2005,9,"The establishment of bachelor groups of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in captivity was considered to be a necessary husbandry step in response to growing concern within the European and North American co-operative breeding programmes that breeding situations are limited [Harcourt, A.H.. 1988. Bachelor groups of gorillas in captivity: the situation in the wild. Dodo 25, 54-61: Johnstone-Scott, R.A., 1988. The potential for establishing bachelor groups of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Dodo 25. 61-66]. Comparisons of behaviour between bachelor groups and breeding groups. targeting situations of social conflict, give an insight into the functions of male/male interactions within bachelor groups.

Observations were undertaken at two zoos in the United Kingdom. one housing a bachelor group and one housing a breeding group of G. g. gorilla. Data were, collected on the frequencies of escalated and non-escalated aggression (aggression), display, play-fighting and displacement (avoidance of aggression), and food-sharing and resource-sharing behaviours (tolerance) between males in three age-classes: silverback, black-back and sub-adult.

Significant differences in behaviour were found between the three age-classes. In both the bachelor (Kruskal-Wallis: K-[2] = 13.58, p < 0.001, post hoc critical value = 9.43) and breeding group (K-[2] = 14.50 p < 0.001, post hoc critical value = 9.87) the silverback exhibited higher levels of escalated aggression than the sub-adults and higher levels of non-escalated aggression than either the blackbacks or the sub-adults (K-[2] = 14.90, p < 0.001. post hoc critical value = 9.43: K-[2] = 21.16 p < 0.001, post hoc critical value = 9.87 for bachelor and breeding groups, respectively). The bachelor group sub-adult initiated significantly lower numbers of displacements (approach-retreat behaviour) than either the silverback or the blackback (K-[2] = 9.72, p < 0.01, post hoc critical value = 9.43), whereas in the breeding group the sub-adult only initiated significantly lower numbers of displacements than the silverback (K-[2] = 11.52, p < 0.01, post hoc critical value = 9.87). Significant differences in play-fighting between the age-classes were only seen in the breeding group, the blackback initiating more play-fights than the silverback (K-[2] = 8.63, p < 0.01, post hoc critical value = 9.87).

Significant differences in behaviour were also found between the groups. In all age-classes the breeding group individuals exhibited higher levels of chest beat display than the bachelor group (Mann-Whitney: U-[10.10] = 9.00, p < 0.01; U-[10.10] = 26.0, p < 0.05; U-[10.10] = 10-5, p = 0.001 for silverbacks, blackbacks and sub-adults, respectively). The breeding group silverback also showed higher levels of non-escalated aggression than the bachelor group silverback (U-[10.10] = 20.0, p < 0.05). The blackbacks in the bachelor group exhibited higher levels of displacements than the breeding group blackback (U-[10.10] = 13.00, p < 0.01).

These results indicate possible differences between bachelor and breeding groups of captive gorillas in their methods of managing social interaction. However, these results are based on a small sample size and represent the initial findings of a larger study. They should be treated with caution until the full study is completed.

We assessed the conservation significance of this site using data on wildlife and habitat conditions collected during a comprehensive primate survey. Scores were attributed to a system of variables and sub-variables to assess the conservation value of the proposed park at the national level. We identified a total of 10 diurnal primate species ( eight monkeys, two apes) and flooded forests were considered as a key habitat for primates as they hold a greater number of species than terra firma forests. We recorded the presence of 12 mammal species listed under the 2000 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, including four classified as Endangered ( two Primates, one Proboscidae and one Insectivora). We found that the conservation value of the proposed park ranked second out of the 15 existing protected areas of the country. Primate abundance was found to be generally higher than in the nearby Dzanga-Ndoki National Park ( the sole other park located in the same vegetation unit), in particular for the species occurring in flooded forests. This highlights the fact that the proposed Mbaere-Bodingue National Park is an important area for the conservation of species associated with flooded forests, a habitat which is currently underrepresented in the national protected area system. Poaching pressure was identified as the main current threat to the integrity of the proposed park."

When the array remained stationary, the chimpanzees remembered both item locations. When arrays were rotated, however, chimpanzees found only I item. In Experiment 3, 2 items were hidden in an array of 7 cups. Both items were found at levels significantly better than chance. Ninety percent of errors were made after the 1st item was found, and errors reflected memory failure rather than a failure of inhibitory control."

F. MacNeilage, M. G. Studdert-Kennedy, and B. Lindblom (1987) proposed a progression for handedness in primates that was supposed to account for the evolution of a right bias in human handedness. To test this proposal, the authors performed meta-analyses on 62 studies that provided individual data (representing 31 species: 9 prosimians, 6 New World monkeys, 10 Old World monkeys, 2 lesser apes, and 4 greater apes), of the 118 studies of primate handedness published since 1987. Although evidence of a population-level left-handed bias for prosimians and Old World monkeys supports P. F. MacNeilage et al., the data from apes, New World monkeys, and individual species of prosimians and New World monkeys do not. Something other than primate handedness may have been the evolutionary precursor of the right bias in hand-use distribution among hominids."
From the ape's dilemma to the weanling's dilemma: early weaning and its evolutionary context,"['Kennedy, GE']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.09.005,FEB 2005,70,"Although humans have a longer period of infant dependency than other hominoids, human infants, in natural fertility societies, are weaned far earlier than any of the great apes: chimps and orangutans wean, on average, at about 5 and 7.7 years, respectively, while humans wean, on average, at about 2.5 years. Assuming that living great apes demonstrate the ancestral weaning pattern, modern humans display a derived pattern that requires explanation, particularly since earlier weaning may result in significant hazards for a child. Clearly, if selection had favored the survival of the child, humans would wean later like other hominoids; selection, then, favored some trait other than the child's survival. It is argued here that our unique pattern of prolonged, early brain growth-the neurological basis for human intellectual ability-cannot be sustained much beyond one year by a human mother's milk alone, and thus early weaning, when accompanied by supplementation with more nutritious adult foods, is vital to the ontogeny of our larger brain, despite the associated dangers. Therefore, the child's intellectual development, rather than its survival, is the primary focus of selection. Consumption of more nutritious foods-derived from animal protein-increased by ca. 2.6 myr ago when a group of early hominins displayed two important behavioral shifts relative to ancestral forms: the recognition that a carcass represented a new and valuable food source-potentially larger than the usual hunted prey-and the use of stone tools to improve access to that food source. The shift in the hominin ""prey image"" to the carcass and the use of tools for butchery increased the amount of protein and calories available, irrespective of the local landscape. However, this shift brought hominins into competition with carnivores, increasing mortality among young adults and necessitating a number of social responses, such as alloparenting. The increased acquisition of meat ca. 2.6 Ma had significant effects on the later course of human evolution and may have initiated the origin of the genus Homo. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Molecular epidemiology of simian T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 in wild and captive sooty mangabeys,"['Traina-Dorge, VL', 'Lorino, R', 'Gormus, BJ', 'Metzger, M', 'Telfer, P', 'Richardson, D', 'Robertson, DL', 'Marx, PA', 'Apetrei, C']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.4.2541-2548.2005,FEB 2005,8,"A study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV) isolates within the long-established Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC) colony of sooty mangabeys (SMs; Cercocebus atys). Serological analysis determined that 22 of 39 animals (56%) were positive for STLV type 1 (STLV-1). A second group of thirteen SM bush meat samples from Sierra Leone in Africa was also included and tested only by PCR. Twenty-two of 39 captive animals (56%) and 3 of 13 bush meat samples (23%) were positive for STLV-1, as shown by testing with PCR. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of viral strains obtained demonstrated that STLV-1 strains from SMs (STLV-Ism strains) from the TNPRC colony and Sierra Leone formed a single cluster together with the previously reported STLV-1sm strain from the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. These data confirm that Africa is the origin for TNPRC STLV-Ism and suggest that Sierra Leone is the origin for the SM colonies in the United States. The TNPRC STLV-Ism strains further divided into two subclusters, suggesting STLV-1sm infection of two original founder SMs at the time of their importation into the United States. STLV-1sm diversity in the TNPRC colony matches the high diversity of SIVsm in the already reported colony. The lack of correlation between the lineage of the simian immunodeficiency virus from SMs (SIVsm) and the STLV-1sm subcluster distribution of the TNPRC strains suggests that intracolony transmissions of both viruses were independent events."
3D-kinematics of vertical climbing in hominoids,"['Isler, K']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10419,JAN 2005,45,"Vertical climbing has played an important role in theories about the evolution of habitual bipedalism in early hommids and of locomotor specialization in hominoids. However, empirical data on vertical climbing in nonhuman primates are scarce, especially regarding kinematics. In this paper, the kinematics of flexed-elbow vertical climbing of four hominoid species are reported: western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), bonobos (Pan paniscus), Sumatran orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus abelii), and yellow-cheeked crested gibbons (Hylobates concolor gabriellae). The climbing sequences were recorded simultaneously by four digital video cameras in European zoos. Analyzed parameters include intersegmental flexion/extension angles of the shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee joints, horizontal abduction/adduction angles of the upper arm and thigh, and distance of the body center of gravity from the substrate. Analyses reveal that differences in climbing kinematics between individuals of different age/sex classes of one species are mostly size-related, whereas interspecific differences reflect specific locomotor adaptations. The climbing kinematics of bonobos and gorillas are more similar to each other than to those of orangutans or gibbons. The range of motion of the major limb joints in adult orangutans is larger than in African apes, although the hip is not more extended. Gibbons horizontally abduct the arm more and the thigh less during climbing than any of the great apes. These results allow us to question some qualitative descriptions of vertical climbing kinematics reported in the literature, and to discuss implications for the evolution of locomotor adaptations in hominoids.

Nucleotide sequence comparison of a chromosome rearrangement on human chromosome 12 and the corresponding ape chromosomes,"['Shimada, MK', 'Kim, CG', 'Kitano, T', 'Ferrell, RE', 'Kohara, Y', 'Saitou, N']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000080805,2005,15,"Chromosome rearrangement has been considered to be important in the evolutionary process. Here, we demonstrate the evolutionary relationship of the rearranged human chromosome 12 and the corresponding chromosome XII in apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon) by examining PCR products derived from the breakpoints of inversions and by conducting shotgun sequencing of a gorilla fosmid clone containing the breakpoint and a ""duplicated segment"" (duplicon). We confirmed that a pair of 23-kb duplicons flank the breakpoints of inversions on the long and short arms of chimpanzee chromosome XII. Although only the 23-kb duplicon on the long arm of chimpanzee chromosome XII and its telomeric flanking sequence are found to be conserved among the hominoids (human, great apes, and gibbons), the duplicon on the short arm of chimpanzee chromosome XII is suggested to be the result of a duplication from that on the long arm. Furthermore, the shotgun sequencing of a gorilla fosmid indicated that the breakpoint on the long arm of the gorilla is located at a different position 1.9 kb from that of chimpanzee. The region is flanked by a sequence homologous to that of human chromosome 6q22. Our findings and sequence analysis suggest a close relationship between segmental duplication and chromosome rearrangement (or breakpoint of inversion) in Hominoidea.

Breakpoint analysis of the pericentric inversion between chimpanzee chromosome 10 and the homologous chromosome 12 in humans,"['Kehrer-Sawatzki, H', 'Sandig, CA', 'Goidts, V', 'Hameister, H']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000080806,2005,32,"During this study, we analysed the pericentric inversion that distinguishes human chromosome 12 (HSA12) from the homologous chimpanzee chromosome (PTR10). Two large chimpanzee-specific duplications of 86 and 23 kb were observed in the breakpoint regions, which most probably occurred associated with the inversion. The inversion break in PTR10p caused the disruption of the SLCO1B3 gene in exon 11. However, the 86-kb duplication includes the functional SLCO1B3 locus, which is thus retained in the chimpanzee, although inverted to PTR10q. The second duplication spans 23 kb and does not contain expressed sequences. Eleven genes map to a region of about 1 Mb around the breakpoints. Six of these eleven genes are not among the differentially expressed genes as determined previously by comparing the human and chimpanzee transcriptome of fibroblast cell lines, blood leukocytes, liver and brain samples. These findings imply that the inversion did not cause major expression differences of these genes. Comparative FISH analysis with BACs spanning the inversion breakpoints in PTR on metaphase chromosomes of gorilla (GGO) confirmed that the pericentric inversion of the chromosome 12 homologs in GGO and PTR have distinct breakpoints and that humans retain the ancestral arrangement. These findings coincide with the trend observed in hominoid karyotype evolution that humans have a karyotype close to an ancestral one, while African great apes present with more derived chromosome arrangements.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization to chromosomes as a tool to understand human and primate genome evolution,"['Wienberg, J']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000080811,2005,23,"For the last 15 years molecular cytogenetic techniques have been extensively used to study primate evolution. Molecular probes were helpful to distinguish mammalian chromosomes and chromosome segments on the basis of their DNA content rather than solely on morphological features such as banding patterns. Various landmark rearrangements have been identified for most of the nodes in primate phylogeny while chromosome banding still provides helpful reference maps. Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) techniques were used with probes of different complexity including chromosome painting probes, probes derived from chromosome sub-regions and in the size of a single gene. Since more recently, in silico techniques have been applied to trace down evolutionarily derived chromosome rearrangements by searching the human and mouse genome sequence databases. More detailed breakpoint analyses of chromosome rearrangements that occurred during higher primate evolution also gave some insights into the molecular changes in chromosome rearrangements that occurred in evolution. Hardly any ""fusion genes"" as known from chromosome rearrangements in cancer cells or dramatic ""position effects"" of genes transferred to new sites in primate genomes have been reported yet. Most breakpoint regions have been identified within gene poor areas rich in repetitive elements and/or low copy repeats ( segmental duplications). The progress in various molecular and molecular-cytogenetic approaches including the recently launched chimpanzee genome project suggests that these new tools will have a significant impact on the further understanding of human genome evolution.

The chromosomal bands that are boundaries of ancestral segments are identified. We have analyzed from data published in the literature 35 different primate species from 19 genera, using the order Scandentia, as well as other published mammalian species as out-groups, and propose an ancestral chromosome number of 2n = 54 for primates, which includes the following chromosomal forms: 1(a+c(1)), 1(b+ c(2)), 2a, 2b, 3/21, 4, 5, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9, 10a, 10b, 11, 12a/22a, 12b/22b, 13, 14/15, 16a, 16b, 17, 18, 19a, 19b, 20 and X and Y. From this analysis, we have been able to point out the human chromosome bands more ""prone"" to breakage during the evolutionary pathways and/or pathology processes. We have observed that 89.09% of the human chromosome bands, which are boundaries for ancestral chromosome segments, contain common fragile sites and/or intrachromosomal telomeric-like sequences. A more in depth analysis of twelve different human chromosomes has allowed us to determine that 62.16% of the chromosomal bands implicated in inversions and 100% involved in fusions/fissions correspond to fragile sites, intrachromosomal telomeric-like sequences and/or bands significantly affected by X irradiation. In addition, 73% of the bands affected in pathological processes are co-localized in bands where fragile sites, intrachromosomal telomeric-like sequences, bands significantly affected by X irradiation and/or evolutionary chromosomal bands have been described. Our data also support the hypothesis that chromosomal breakages detected in pathological processes are not randomly distributed along the chromosomes, but rather concentrate in those important evolutionary chromosome bands which correspond to fragile sites and/or intrachromosomal telomeric-like sequences.

New insights into the evolution of chromosome 1,"['Weise, A', 'Starke, H', 'Mrasek, K', 'Claussen, U', 'Liehr, T']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000080819,2005,19,"A complex low-repetitive human DNA probe (BAC RP11-35B4) together with two microdissection-derived region-specific probes of the multicolor banding (MCB) probe-set for chromosome 1 were used to re-analyze the evolution of human chromosome 1 in comparison to four ape species. BAC RP11-35B4 derives from 1q21 and contains 143 kb of nonrepetitive DNA; however, it produces three specific FISH signals in 1q21, 1p12 and 1p36.1 of Homo sapiens (HSA). Human chromosome 1 was studied in comparison to its homologues in Hylobates lar (HLA), Pongo pygmaeus (PPY), Gorilla gorilla (GGO) and Pan troglodytes (PTR). A duplication of sequences homologous to human 1p36.1 could be detected in PPY plus an additional signal on PPY 16q. The region homologous to HSA 1p36.1 is also duplicated in HLA, and split onto chromosomes 7q and 9p; the region homologous to HSA 1q21/1p12 is present as one region on 5q. Additionally, the breakpoint of a small pericentric inversion in the evolution of human chromosome 1 compared to other great ape species could be refined. In summary, the results obtained here are in concordance with previous reports; however, there is evidence for a deletion of regions homologous to human 1p34.2 -->p34.1 during evolution in the Pongidae branch after separation of PPY.

Furthermore, the chromosomal position of CLDN1 was determined in mouse chromosomes by FISH. The position of fluorescent signals is confined to a single chromosomal site in both great apes and mouse and in each case maps to the chromosomal region that has conserved synteny with HSA3 (PTR2q28, GGO2q28, PPY2q38 and MMU16B1).

Genetic evidence of a strong functional constraint of neurotrypsin during primate evolution,"['Xu, HL', 'Su, B']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000081523,2005,4,"Neurotrypsin is one of the extra-cellular serine proteases that are predominantly expressed in the brain and involved in neuronal development and function. Mutations in humans are associated with autosomal recessive non-syndromic mental retardation (MR). We studied the molecular evolution of neurotrypsin by sequencing the coding region of neurotrypsin in 11 representative non-human primate species covering great apes, lesser apes, Old World monkeys and New World monkeys. Our results demonstrated a strong functional constraint of neurotrypsin that was caused by strong purifying selection during primate evolution, an implication of an essential functional role of neurotrypsin in primate cognition. Further analysis indicated that the purifying selection was in fact acting on the SRCR domains of neurotrypsin, which mediate the binding activity of neurotrypsin to cell surface or extracellular proteins. In addition, by comparing primates with three other mammalian orders, we demonstrated that the absence of the first copy of the SRCR domain (exon 2 and 3) in mouse and rat was due to the deletion of this segment in the murine lineage.

Inferring the mode of speciation from genomic data: A study of the great apes,"['Osada, N', 'Wu, CI']",GENETICS,10.1534/genetics.104.029231,JAN 2005,60,"The strictly allopatric model of speciation makes definable predictions on the pattern of divergence, one of which is the uniformity in the divergence time across genomic regions. Using 345 coding and 143 intergenic sequences from the African great apes, we were able to reject the mill hypothesis that the divergence time in the coding sequences (CDSs) and intergenic sequences (IGSs) is the same between human and chimpanzee. The conclusion is further supported by the analysis of whole-genome sequences between these species. The difference suggests a prolonged period of genetic exchange during the formation of these two species. Because the analysis should be generally applicable, collecting DNA sequence data from many genomic regions between closely related species should help to settle the debate over the prevalence of the allopatric mode of speciation."
Patterns of size sexual dimorphism in Australopithecus afarensis: Another look,"['Lee, SH']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jchb.2005.07.001,2005,7,"Size sexual dimorphism is one of the major components of morphological variation and has been associated with socioecology and behavioral variables such as mating patterns, Although several studies have addressed the magnitude and pattern of sexual dimorphism in Australopithecus afarensis, one of the earliest hominids, consensus has yet to be reached. This paper uses assigned resampling method, a data resampling method to estimate the magnitude of sexual dimorphism without relying on individual sex assessments, to examine the fossil hominid sample from Hadar. Two questions are asked: first, whether sexual dimorphism in a selected sample of skeletal elements of A. afarensis is the same as that in living humans, chimpanzees, or gorillas; and second, whether different skeletal elements reflect variation in sexual dimorphism in the same way. All possible metric variables were used as data in applying the method, including seven variables from three elements (mandibular canine, humerus, femur). Analyses show that A. afarensis is similar in size sexual dimorphism to gorillas in femoral variables, to humans in humeral variables, and to chimpanzees in canine variables. The results of this study are compatible with the hypothesis that the pattern of sexual dimorphism in A. afarensis is different from any that are observed in living humans or apes.

Sex differences in the relative lengths of metacarpals and metatarsals in gorillas and chimpanzees,"['McFadden, D', 'Bracht, MS']",HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR,10.1016/j.yhbeh.2004.08.013,JAN 2005,29,"Sex differences other than the simple dimorphism in size were documented for the metapodials of two primate species. Lengths of metacarpals and metatarsals were obtained from the skeletons of 64 gorillas and 42 chimpanzees. Length ratios were constructed for all possible pairings of the five bones in each individual hand and foot. For both species, several of these length ratios exhibited substantial differences between the sexes. Body size was not the basis for these sex differences; when specimens of similar size were compared, the sex differences remained. In humans, length ratios for the fingers and toes also have previously been demonstrated to exhibit sex differences, and the length ratio for the index and ring fingers (the 213:413 ratio) has been shown to correlate with various medical conditions. Various facts suggest that length ratios in human digits are associated with androgen exposure, probably during prenatal development. For gorillas, the metacarpal length ratio showing the largest sex difference was 4Mc:5Mc in both hands, and the metatarsal length ratio showing the largest sex difference was 1Mt:2Mt in the left foot. Sex differences in length ratios also existed for chimpanzees, but they were generally smaller than for gorillas. Apparently, both gorillas and chimpanzees are affected by developmental mechanisms, possibly androgenic mechanisms, similar to those in humans. Analyses of previous measurements [Susman, R.L., 1979 Comparative and functional morphology of hominoid fingers. Am. J, Phys. Anthropol. 50, 215-236] revealed that all components of the rays are not affected equally by whatever mechanisms are responsible for the sex differences in length ratios. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Nuclear insertions help and hinder inference of the evolutionary history of gorilla mtDNA,"['Thalmann, O', 'Serre, D', 'Hofreiter, M', 'Lukas, D', 'Eriksson, J', 'Vigilant, L']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02382.x,JAN 2005,34,"Numts are fragments of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that have been translocated to the nucleus, where they can persist while their mitochondrial counterparts continue to rapidly evolve. Thus, numts represent 'molecular fossils' useful for comparison with mitochondrial variation, and are particularly suited for studies of the fast-evolving hypervariable segment of the mitochondrial control region (HV1). Here we used information from numts found in western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei) to estimate that these two species diverged about 1.3 million years ago (Ma), an estimate similar to recent calculations for the divergence of chimpanzee and bonobo. We also describe the sequence of a gorilla numt still possessing a segment lost from all contemporary gorilla mtDNAs. In contrast to that sequence, many numts of the HV1 are highly similar to authentic mitochondrial organellar sequences, making it difficult to determine whether purported mitochondrial sequences truly derive from that genome. We used all available organellar HV1 and corresponding numt sequences from gorillas in a phylogenetic analysis aimed at distinguishing these two types of sequences. Numts were found in several clades in the tree. This, in combination with the fact that only a limited amount of the extant variation in gorillas has been sampled, suggests that categorization of new sequences by the indirect means of phylogenetic comparison would be prone to uncertainty. We conclude that for taxa such as gorillas that contain numerous numts, direct approaches to the authentication of HV1 sequences, such as amplification strategies relying upon the circularity of the mtDNA molecule, remain necessary."

Detecting genetic drift versus selection in human evolution,"['Ackermann, RR', 'Cheverud, JM']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0405919102,DEC 28 2004,69,"Recent paleoanthropological discoveries reveal a diverse, potentially speciose human fossil record. Such extensive morphological diversity results from the action of divergent evolutionary forces on an evolving lineage. Here, we apply quantitative evolutionary theory to test whether random evolutionary processes alone can explain the morphological diversity seen among fossil australopith and early Homo crania from the Plio-Pleistocene. We show that although selection may have played an important role in diversifying hominin facial morphology in the late Pliocene, this is not the case during the early evolution of the genus Homo, where genetic drift was probably the primary force responsible for facial diversification."
Wide faces or large canines?

We resolve this paradox by examining sex differences in hominoid facial morphology. We show that chimpanzees, but not gorillas, exhibit clear sexual dimorphism in face width, over and above that expected based on sex differences in body size. We show that this facial dimorphism, expressed as an index, is negatively correlated with canine dimorphism among anthropoid primates. Our findings suggest that a lack of canine dimorphism in anthropoids is not owing to weak sexual selection, but rather is associated with strong sexual selection for broader face width. Enlarged cheekbones are linked with attractiveness in humans, and we propose that the evolution of a broad face and loss of large canines in hominid males results from mate choice."
Inter- and intra-specific variation in the ontogeny of the hominoid facial skeleton: testing assumptions of ontogenetic variability,"['Vioarsdottir, US', 'Cobb, S']",ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER,NA,DEC 2004,16,"In this paper we use geometric morphometric techniques to test two assumptions that are commonly made about variations in facial ontogeny: closely related species, or members of the same species, will share a common early post-natal ontogeny; and closely related species, or members of the same species, will share a common ontogenetic scaling trajectory. To test these assumptions we use four species of hominines: Homo sapiens, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus. The first assumption is falsified, both inter- and intra-specifically, using discriminant analysis with crossvalidation of subadults prior to the onset of the eruption of the permanent dentition. The second assumption only holds true for inter-specific comparisons of ontogenetic scaling trajectories, while assumptions of variation in intra-specific scaling trajectories are falsified with these data."
Craniofacial sexual dimorphism patterns and allometry among extant hominids,"['Schaefer, K', 'Mitteroecker, P', 'Gunz, P', 'Bernhard, M', 'Bookstein, FL', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER,10.1016/S0940-9602(04)80086-4,DEC 2004,35,"Craniofacial sexual dimorphism in primates varies in both magnitude and pattern among species. In the past two decades, there has been an increasing emphasis in exploring the correlations of these patterns with taxonomy and the variation in patterns within and among the craniofacial regions.

Scrutinising these relationships for hominids, we decompose the craniofacial morphology in five taxa: Homo sapiens, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus. 3D coordinates of 35 traditional landmarks and 61 semilandmarks, covering five ridge curves, are measured for each of 268 adult and sub-adult specimens and analysed using geometric morphometric methods.

A multivariate analysis in size-shape space shows that ontogenetic scaling contributes to the development of sexual dimorphism in all five taxa, but to a varying extent. In absolute as well as in relative terms P pygmaeus shows the greatest allometric component, followed by G. gorilla. Homo is intermediate, while in Pan the non-allometric constituent part contributes a large fraction to the actual sexual dimorphism, most markedly in the pygmy chimpanzee. An eigendecomposition of the five vectors of sexual dimorphism reveals two dimensions independent of allometry. One separates orang-utan sexual dimorphism from the African apes and Homo, and the other differentiates between the great apes and Homo with Pan mediating.

We discuss these patterns and speculate on their use as characters for taxonomic analysis in the fossil record."
"A biomechanical approach to craniofacial shape in primates, using FESA","['Preuschoft, H', 'Witzel, U']",ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER,10.1016/S0940-9602(04)80071-2,DEC 2004,11,"The head of a land-living vertebrate is exposed to the forces of acceleration, in particular the permanent earth acceleration (= gravity) and the muscle-generated bite and chewing forces. In mammals, at least, the latter seem to play the dominant role. Bite forces are applied to the teeth and close the circle of forces by passing through the facial skeleton to the insertions of the mandibular adductors. With the aid of three-dimensional Finite Element Systems Analysis (FESA), the stress flows in homogenous bodies are investigated, whereby the braincase, the orbits and the nasal channel are taken as preconditions. The muscle insertions are varied systematically. The resulting stress flows in all cases turn out to be very similar to the bony structures of a skull. Little or not stressed parts of the available homogenous body indicate the external surface or hollow spaces (= sinuses) inside the skull. The possible applications of forces (i.e., the forms and positions of the dental arcade in relation to the braincase) determine the pathways along which the forces are transmitted. It seems that the factors mentioned above as preconditions represent the selective pressures exerted by the lifestyle of the animal and its environment (= ecological conditions). The results that can be obtained by our deductive approach in comparison to inductive, experimental procedures are discussed briefly."
On the scaling relationship between enamel prisin length and enamel thickness in primate molars: a comment,"['Macho, GA']",ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER,10.1016/S0940-9602(04)80073-6,DEC 2004,3,"As part of a larger study we developed a computer programme which allows the recreation of the complex 3-dimensional arrangement of prisms. Data presented in these earlier publications are re-analyzed to assess the relationship between projected prism length (i.e., enamel thickness) and the true prism length. Across primates, proportional prism deviation increases as the enamel becomes thicker. This supports suggestions that prism decussation may be particularly marked in large-bodied and thick-enameled species. There are differences, however, in scaling relationships between species, which correspond to the species' dietary adaptations. Finally, the findings highlight the importance of employing species-specific correction factors for the calculation of prism length (i.e., life-span of the ameloblast) for life history enquiry."
A geometric morphometric assessment of hominoid crania: conservative African apes and their liberal implications,"['McNulty, KP']",ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER,10.1016/S0940-9602(04)80077-3,DEC 2004,5,"This study examined the cranial affinities of all extant hominoids using 3D geometric morphometric analysis. A least squares Procrustean superimposition was used to eliminate differences due to location, orientation, and size. Because of a persistent correlation between centroid size and shape variation, an allometric size adjustment was also applied to these data. Phenetic affinities were then examined through a battery of multivariate statistical analyses.

Results of this study indicate a strong affinity between Hylobates and Gorilla; Pan is also similar to these genera, while Pongo and Homo are each very different. The autapomorphic morphologies of orangutan and modern human crania have been well established from previous studies. The similarity between Hylobates and Gorilla, however, has important implications for studies of hominoid morphology. First, these results suggest that African ape crania - and particularly those of Gorilla - retain an overall morphology that is conservative among hominoids. Secondly, this similarity suggests that character coding of cranial features may tend to overestimate the degree of polymorphism among extant apes. This study concludes that allometry may play a greater role in the morphogenesis of hominoid cranial variation than has been previously thought. While this problem likely has negligible impact on systematic studies of extant hominoids, it seriously affects our ability to place fossil taxa within a phylogenetic framework."
The evolution of eutherian chromosomes,"['Wienberg, J']",CURRENT OPINION IN GENETICS & DEVELOPMENT,10.1016/j.gde.2004.10.001,DEC 2004,43,"The gross organization of the genome of Eutheria (placental mammals) into chromosomes follows a simple architecture that, with some minor changes, is almost completely conserved for more than 100 million years in various species of almost all extant mammalian orders. Recent molecular cytogenetic results - especially those from the assumed oldest clade, the Afrotheria - suggest an ancestral karyotype that would calculate the 'default' frequency of gross rearrangements to less than two changes within 10 million years of mammalian evolution. The main changes are the fission, movement and subsequent fusion of large chromosome segments or of chromosome arms. Reciprocal translocations are the exception. Chromosome numbers may have increased or decreased significantly in this fusion/fission process but, in most instances, the main architecture still remains evident. There are, however, some exceptions in mammals with extremely derived karyotypes."
Analysis of the human and ape foot during bipedal standing with implications for the evolution of the foot,"['Wang, WJ', 'Crompton, RH']",JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.02.036,DEC 2004,23,"The ratio of the power arm (the distance from the heel to the talocrural joint) to the load arm (that from the talocrural joint to the distal head of the metatarsals), or RPL, differs markedly between the human and ape foot. The arches are relatively higher in the human foot in comparison with those in apes. This study evaluates the effect of these two differences on biomechanical effectiveness during bipedal standing, estimating the forces acting across the talocrural and tarsometatarsal joints, and attempts to identify which type of foot is optimal for bipedal standing. A simple model of the foot musculoskeletal system was built to represent the geometric and force relationships in the foot during bipedal standing, and measurements for a variety of human and ape feet applied. The results show that: (1) an RPL of around 40% (as is the case in the human foot) minimizes required muscle force at the talocrural joint; (2) the presence of an high arch in the human foot reduces forces in the plantar musculature and aponeurosis; and (3) the human foot has a lower total of force in joints and Muscles than do the ape feet. These results indicate that the proportions of the human foot, and the height of the medial arch are indeed better optimized for bipedal standing than those of apes, further suggesting that their current state is to some extent the product of positive selection for enhanced bipedal standing during the evolution of the foot.

Helminth eggs, larvae, and protozoan cysts were isolated by sodium nitrate flotation and fecal sedimentation. Helminth parasites were identified, and infection prevalence was determined for all 4 guenon species. Coprocultures facilitated identification of strongylate nematodes. For the most common species, the redtail guenon, we documented prevalence of protozoan parasites and examined the effect of season and host sex on infection prevalence. Six nematodes (Strongyloides fulleborni, Oesophagostomum sp., unidentified strongyle, Trichuris sp., Streptopharagus sp., and Enterobius sp.), 1 cestode (Bertiella sp.), 1 trematode (Dicrocoeliidae), and 5 protozoans (Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba histolytica, Iodameoba butschlii, Giardia lamblia, and Chilomastix mesnili) were detected. Seasonal patterns of infection were not readily apparent for any parasite species infecting redtail guenons. Although prevalence never differed between male and female guenons, only adult females were infected with Oesophagostomum sp. and S. fulleborni."

Gorilla B was treated at the age of 17 mo, and normal visual development proceeded in both eyes. This animal developed bilateral after-cataract and therefore needed a second intervention in both eyes using Nd:YAG laser treatment. The genetic component of juvenile cataracts should be considered in breeding management programs."

Serial segmental duplications during primate evolution result in complex human genome architecture,"['Stankiewicz, P', 'Shaw, CJ', 'Withers, M', 'Inoue, K', 'Lupski, JR']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.2746604,NOV 2004,79,"The human genome is particularly rich in low-copy repeats (LCRs) or segmental duplications (5%-10%), and this characteristic likely distinguishes us from lower mammals such as rodents. How and why the complex human genome architecture consisting of multiple LCRs has evolved remains an open question. Using molecular and computational analyses of human and primate genomic regions, we analyzed the structure and evolution of LCRs that resulted in complex architectural features of the human genome in proximal 17p. We found that multiple LCRs of different origins are situated adjacent to one another, whereas each LCR changed at different time points between >25 to 3-7 million years ago (Mya) during primate evolution. Evolutionary studies in primates suggested communication between the LCRs by gene conversion. The DNA transposable element MERI-Charlie3 and retroviral ERVL elements were identified at the breakpoint of the t(4;19) chromosome translocation in Gorilla gorilla, suggesting a potential role for transpositions in evolution of the primate genome. Thus, a series of consecutive segmental duplication events during primate evolution resulted in complex genome architecture in proximal 17p. Some of the more recent events led to the formation of novel genes that in human are expressed primarily in the brain. Our observations support the contention that serial segmental duplication events might have orchestrated primate evolution by the generation of novel fusion/fission genes as well as potentially by genomic inversions associated with decreased recombination rates facilitating gene divergence."

Sequences of a 425 bp fragment of the integrase gene were obtained for 11 animals. Phylogenetic studies indicated that strains from gorillas, mandrills and drills each formed a highly supported phylogenetic clade with, moreover, the existence of two different gorilla SFVs. This study demonstrates for the first time that these animals are naturally infected with specific SFVs. In the context of simian-to-human interspecies transmission, the results confirm that such viruses can also infect humans, as the SFVs identified in wild-caught animals were the same as those recently reported as infecting hunters living in the same geographical areas."

Our comparative sequence analysis showed that only the hominoid species (humans and apes) have the intact open reading frame of the type II splice form, indicating that the type II neuropsin originated recently in the primate lineage about 18 MYA. Expression analysis using RT-PCR detected abundant expression of the type II form in the frontal lobe of the adult human brain, but no expression was detected in the brains of lesser apes and Old World monkeys, indicating that the type II form of neuropsin only became functional in recent time, and it might contribute to the progressive change of cognitive abilities during primate evolution."
Major histocompatibility complex and microsatellite variation in two populations of wild gorillas,"['Lukas, D', 'Bradley, BJ', 'Nsubuga, AM', 'Doran-Sheehy, D', 'Robbins, MM', 'Vigilant, L']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02353.x,NOV 2004,28,"In comparison to their close relatives the chimpanzees and humans, very little is known concerning the amount and structure of genetic variation in gorillas. Two species of gorillas are recognized and while the western gorillas number in the tens of thousands, only several hundred representatives of the mountain gorilla subspecies of eastern gorillas survive. To analyse the possible effects of these different population sizes, this study compares the variation observed at microsatellite and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci in samples of wild western and mountain gorillas, collected using a sampling scheme that targeted multiple social groups within defined geographical areas. Noninvasive samples proved a viable source of DNA for sequence analysis of the second exon of the DRB loci of the MHC. Observed levels of variation at the MHC locus were similar between the two gorilla species and were comparable to those in other primates. Comparison of results from analysis of variation at multiple microsatellite loci found only a slight reduction in heterozygosity for the mountain gorillas despite the relatively smaller population size."
Variations in adrenal androgen production among (nonhuman) primates,"['Conley, AJ', 'Pattison, JC', 'Bird, IM']",SEMINARS IN REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE,10.1055/s-2004-861548,NOV 2004,44,"The synthesis and secretion of the adrenal androgens dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DS) is a phenomenon apparently unique to humans and nonhuman primates. It occurs at three life stages: in utero from the fetal zone (FZ) cells of the developing adrenal cortex, during adolescence with the onset of adrenarche and the development of the zona reticularis (ZR), and in ever decreasing amounts from the ZR with aging (adrenal senescence). Insufficient data exist to know if any single nonhuman primate exactly mirrors human adrenal androgen secretion through an three life stages, and detailed morphological, biochemical, and endocrinologic studies are required to do so. Androgen synthesis requires that cells express three key enzymes, 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase cytochrome P450 (P450c17), nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR), and cytochrome b5, and that they do not express 3beta-hydroxysterold dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD). Cytochrome b5 has emerged as a particularly useful marker of androgen synthetic potential. Although a reliable index of the rate of adrenal androgen secretion, DS concentrations may not accurately reflect total adrenal androgen output because rates and routes of androgen metabolism may vary greatly among species. Based on the very limited available data, the most promising nonhuman primate models are marmosets for the human FZ, chimpanzees for human adrenarche, and macaques and baboons for mature ZR function that declines with senescence."
Common aspects of human and primate seronegative arthritis,"['Hyrich, KL', 'Kim, TH', 'Payne, U', 'Zhang, X', 'Chiu, B', 'Mehren, K', 'Inman, RD']",JOURNAL OF RHEUMATOLOGY,NA,NOV 2004,2,"A 27-year-old female lowland gorilla developed an asymmetric oligoarthritis 3 months post-partum. There was no evidence of an antecedent gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection. Serum was negative for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody. Synovial fluid revealed 2000 white blood cells with negative cultures and polarized microscopy. Studies on synoviocytes were the following: (1) FACS analysis revealed surface expression of a B27-like epitope of the cells. (2) Analysis of intracellular clearance kinetics of arthritogenic organisms showed peak intracellular colony-forming units at 48 hours after bacterial invasion, and clearance by 13 days post-invasion. (3) Interferon-gamma (0.1-10.0 ng/ml) accelerated intracellular microbicidal pathways in a dose-dependent fashion. These findings closely parallel those seen in human synoviocytes of patients with spondyloarthropathy. Primate and human seronegative arthritis share clinical and immunologic features, as well as aspects of host:pathogen defense mechanisms. The interplay of genetic and microbial factors underlying this arthritis appears to be conserved across these species boundaries."

Apes and monkeys have been reported to be differentially susceptible to developing tau pathology. Despite this, only little is known about the organisation and sequence of Tau from nonhuman primates. Here we have sequenced Tau exons 1-13, including flanking intronic regions, and the region in intron 9 that contains Saitohin in chimpanzees.. gorillas, and gibbons. Partial sequences were obtained for cynomolgus macaque and green monkey. Chimpanzee brain tau was 100% identical to human tau. Identities were 99.5% for gorilla tau and 99.0% for gibbon tau. Chimpanzee DNA was polymorphic for a repeat in intron 9, which was present in human and gorilla tau, and for the nucleotide at position +29 of the intron that follows exon 10. As was the case of the other nonhuman primates examined, chimpanzee DNA was homozygous for nucleotides used to define the H2 haplotype in human Tau. These differences between human and chimpanzee Tau may contribute to the apparent resistance of chimpanzee brain to developing tau pathology.

Social structure and life-history patterns in western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Robbins, MM', 'Bermejo, M', 'Cipolletta, C', 'Magliocca, F', 'Parnell, RJ', 'Stokes, E']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20069,OCT 2004,73,"Life-history traits and ecological conditions have an important influence on primate social systems. Most of what we know about the life-history patterns and social structure of gorillas comes from studies of eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei sp.), which live under dramatically different ecological conditions compared to western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla sp.). In this paper we present new data on western gorilla social structure and life histories from four study sites, and make comparisons with eastern gorilla populations. Data were obtained from two study sites with gorilla groups undergoing the habituation process (Lossi, Democratic Republic of Congo; and Bai Hokou, Central African Republic) and two ""bai"" studies (Maya Nord and Mbeli Bai, Republic of Congo). The size and structure of these groups were similar to those seen in eastern gorillas. However, differences in the occurrence of various group transitions (group formations, changes between one-male and multimale composition, and group disintegrations) exist, and western gorillas notably exhibit much higher rates of male emigration and correspondingly fewer multimale groups compared to mountain gorillas. Certain phenomena have been observed only rarely, including predation by leopards. The preliminary data show no significant differences in birth rates between western gorillas and mountain gorillas. The ecological variability across gorilla habitats likely explains the flexibility in the social system of gorillas, but we need more information on the social relationships and ecology of western gorillas to elucidate the causes for the similarities and differences between western and eastern gorillas on the levels of individuals, social groups, and population dynamics.

Genetic variation in gorillas,"['Vigilant, L', 'Bradley, BJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20070,OCT 2004,11,"This review summarizes what is currently known concerning genetic variation in gorillas, on both inter- and intraspecific levels. Compared to the human species, gorillas, along with the other great apes, possess greater genetic varation as a consequence of a demographic history of rather constant population size. Data and hence conclusions from analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the usual means of describing intraspecific patterns of genetic diversity, are limited at this time. An important task for future studies is to determine the degree of confidence with which gorilla mtDNA can be analyzed, in view of the risk that one will inadvertently analyze artifactual rather than genuine sequences. The limited information available from sequences of nuclear genomic segments does not distinguish western from eastern gorillas, and, in comparison with results from the two chimpanzee species, suggests a relatively recent common ancestry for all gorillas. In the near future, the greatest insights are likely to come from studies aimed at genetic characterization of all individual members of social groups. Such studies, addressing topics such as behavior of individuals with kin and non-kin, and the actual success of male reproductive strategies, will provide a link between behavioral and genetic studies of gorillas.

Western gorilla diet: A synthesis from six sites,"['Rogers, ME', 'Abernethy, K', 'Bermejo, M', 'Cipolletta, C', 'Doran, D', 'McFarland, K', 'Nishihara, T', 'Remis, M', 'Tutin, CEG']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20071,OCT 2004,89,"The objective of this paper is to collate information on western gorilla diet from six study sites throughout much of their current range, including preliminary information from two sites (Afi and Lossi), where studies of diet have begun only recently. Food lists were available from each site, derived from indirect signs of gorilla feeding (such as feces), with some observational data. Important staple, seasonal, and fallback foods have been identified, and a number of striking similarities across sites have been revealed based on a much larger data set than was previously available. It was confirmed that the western gorilla diet is always eclectic, including up to 230 items and 180 species. The greatest diversity is found among the fruit species eaten, fruit being included in western gorilla diets from all sites and throughout most or all of the year. Eight plant families provide important foods at five, or all six, sites, suggesting that it may be possible in the future to predict which habitats are the most suitable for gorillas. Gorillas exploit both rare and common forest species. Similarities and differences among sites can be explained superficially on the basis of geography and the past history of the forest. Gorilla density across sites appears to be most affected by the density of monocotyledonous bulk food plants, but its relationship to the density of important tree food species has yet to be tested.

"Effects of group dynamics and diet on the ranging patterns of a western gorilla group (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic","['Cipolletta, C']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20072,OCT 2004,23,"This study describes how group dynamics and diet have influenced the ranging patterns of a western gorilla group at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic. The results are compared with those from an earlier study [Cipolletta, International Journal of Primatology, 2003], when the same group was larger and undergoing the process of habituation to humans. Data were obtained from maps of the gorillas' travel routes, direct observations, and analysis of fecal samples. Through the years, the group has experienced a decrease in size, from eight to three individuals, with periods of membership fluctuation. The male's search for new mates resulted in a larger home range than was recorded when the group consisted of more individuals. Moreover, despite an average group size of three throughout this study, the monthly range and mean daily path length (DPL) were also larger when the group was acquiring/losing members in new areas, than when no new members joined or left the group. Fruit was consumed year-round, although more heavily so during wet months. The influence of fruit consumption on the ranging patterns was concealed initially by the effect of habituation [Cipolletta, International Journal of Primatology, 2003], and later (at least partially) by the male's search for new mates. In the last 14 months of the study, when the group numbered only three individuals and was ranging in a restricted area, the average DPL, but not the monthly range, increased when the gorillas were consuming more fruit.

Impact of ecological and social factors on ranging in western gorillas,"['Doran-Sheehy, DM', 'Greer, D', 'Mongo, P', 'Schwindt, D']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20075,OCT 2004,53,"We examined the influence of ecological (diet, swamp use, and rainfall) and social (intergroup interaction rate) factors on ranging behavior in one group of western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) during a 16-month study. Relative to mountain gorillas, western gorillas live in habitats with reduced herb densities, more readily available fruit (from seasonal and rare fruit trees), and, at some sites, localized large open clearings (swamps and ""bais""). Ranging behavior reflects these ecological differences. The daily path length (DPL) of western gorillas was longer (mean = 2,014 m) than that of mountain gorillas, and was largely related to fruit acquisition. Swamp use occurred frequently (27% of days) and incurred a 50% increase in DPL, and 77% of the variation in monthly frequency of swamp use was explained by ripe fruit availability within the swamp, and not by the absence of resources outside the swamp. The annual home-range size was 15.4 km(2). The western gorilla group foraged in larger areas each month, and reused them more frequently and consistently through time compared to mountain gorillas. In contrast to mountain gorillas, intergroup encounters occurred at least four times more frequently, were usually calm rather than aggressive, and had no consistent effect on DPL or monthly range size for one group of western gorillas. High genetic relatedness among at least some neighboring males [Bradley et al., Current Biology, in press] may help to explain these results, and raises intriguing questions about western gorilla social relationships.

The total home-range size of the focal group, which I calculated by superimposing a 100 m x 100 mm grid over the mapped daily path traveled, was 11 km(2). The majority (73%) of the group's home range was used exclusively, although at the periphery it overlapped with the ranges of three other groups. Most encounters (86%) with other groups (n = 14) took place in the periphery of the home range, and appeared to involve access to fruit trees. The focal group silverback's encounters with solitary silverbacks occurred throughout the focal group's home range, did not involve access to fruit, and typically resulted in aggressive or avoidance behavior. The focal group silverback's response to other group males was more varied: it included tolerance (64%), avoidance (14%), and aggression (21%), and was dependent upon the identity of the extragroup male. The focal group exhibited an unusual form of tolerant behavior toward some other groups by occasionally forming ""nesting supergroups"" (two groups nested together overnight at distances of 30-50 m). The western gorillas at Lossi were somewhat fluid in their grouping. Subgrouping and supergrouping occurred, although more infrequently than reported previously, and with a new twist: subgrouping did not necessarily require a silverback's presence. I stress the need for intraspecific comparisons and more complete data sets on western gorilla social organization. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Within-group social relationships among females and adult males in wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Stokes, EJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20074,OCT 2004,28,"Within-group female relationships, and relationships between females and adult males have not been described for wild western lowland gorillas. New data are presented here from Mbeli Bai in the Nouabale-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo. Nine groups were observed over a continuous 2-year period, and affiliative and agonistic interactions, as well as time spent by females and adult males in proximity to each other were recorded. Affiliative behavior was extremely rare in the bai, and measures of proximity between individuals were inconclusive because of the small sample sizes. Rates of agonistic interaction among females were highly variable between groups. The majority of agonistic interactions were undecided, and the supplant rate was low. Evidence for an agonistic dominance hierarchy is weak. The data do not support hypotheses that increased frugivory in western lowland gorillas raises levels of within-group contest competition; however, the need for intersite comparisons is stressed. In contrast, rates of agonistic behavior between females and silverback males were higher and more consistent between groups. Agonistic relationships between males and females conformed with patterns seen in mountain gorillas, where male protection from intraspecific aggression is important. The benefit females gain by forming long-term cooperative alliances appears to be small, and is likely outweighed by reproductive advantages associated with male protection.

Positive selection in MAOA gene is human exclusive: determination of the putative amino acid change selected in the human lineage,"['Andres, AM', 'Soldevila, M', 'Navarro, A', 'Kidd, KK', 'Oliva, B', 'Bertranpetit, J']",HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s00439-004-1179-6,OCT 2004,26,"Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is the X-linked gene responsible for deamination and subsequent degradation of several neurotransmitters and other amines. Among other activities, the gene has been shown to play a role in locomotion, circadian rhythm, and pain sensitivity and to have a critical influence on behavior and cognition. Previous studies have reported a non-neutral evolution of the gene attributable to positive selection in the human lineage. To determine whether this selection was human-exclusive or shared with other species, we performed a population genetic analysis of the pattern of nucleotide variation in non-human species, including bonobo, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. Footprints of positive selection were absent in all analyzed species, suggesting that positive selection has been recent and unique to humans. To determine which human-unique genetic changes could have been responsible for this differential evolution, the coding region of the gene was compared between human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. Only one human exclusive non-conservative change is present in the gene: Glu151Lys. This human substitution affects protein dimerization according to a three-dimensional structural model that predicts a non-negligible functional shift. This is the only candidate position at present to have been selected to fixation in humans during an episode of positive selection. Divergence analysis among species has shown that, even under positive selection in the human lineage, the MAOA gene did not experience accelerated evolution in any of the analyzed lineages, and that tools such as K-a/K-s would not have detected the selective history of the gene."

"Intrapopulation differences in ant eating in the mountain gorillas of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda","['Ganas, J', 'Robbins, MM']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-004-0089-5,OCT 2004,15,"Variability in ant eating has been observed in several populations of eastern and western gorillas. We investigated the occurrence of ant (Dorylus sp.) eating in two groups of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) with overlapping home ranges within Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda from September 2001 to August 2002. We calculated the frequency of ant eating by an indirect method of analyzing fecal samples from silverbacks, adult females, and juveniles. One group consumed ants significantly more often than the other (3.3 vs 17.6% of days sampled). Furthermore, the group that consumed ants more often also consumed them on a seasonal basis (September-February monthly range: 0-8%; March-August monthly range: 30-42.9%). Finally, females and juveniles of this group consumed ants significantly more often than did the silverback (total samples containing ants: silverback, 2.1%; adult female, 13.2%; juvenile, 11.2%). Differences in ant eating between groups are likely due to variability in use of habitats where ants occur (particularly secondary forests). Surveys of ant densities in differing habitats, nutritional analysis of ants, and quantification of the amount of ants in their diets are necessary to understand if ant consumption is due to availability, nutritional value, group traditions, or taste preference."
Bony ponticles of the atlas (C1) over the groove for the vertebral artery in humans and primates: Polymorphism and evolutionary trends,"['Le Minor, JM', 'Trost, O']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10270,SEP 2004,18,"The aim of this study was to ascertain the distribution in primates of the three possible bony ponticles over the groove for the vertebral artery (ventral, lateral, and dorsal ponticles), in order to attempt to understand the variants observed in humans and to ascertain possible evolutionary trends in primates. The material consisted of 393 atlases of extant nonhuman primates representative of 41 genera, and of 500 human atlases (dried bones of adults). For each atlas, we studied the existence and morphology of the ponticles, and the type of association of these three ponticles on a given side, which are theoretically of eight in number (types A-H). The occurrence of these ponticles varied from complete absence to constant presence, according to the genera and taxa of primates. The presence of each of these ponticles in primates can be interpreted as a primitive or plesiomorphic character, and their absence as a derived or apomorphic character. The strepsirhines-platyrrhines-cercopithecines group, presenting a predominant primitive pattern (type A), appeared to be separated from the colobines-hominoids group, presenting predominant derived patterns (type C in colobines, Pongo pygmaeus, and Pan troglodytes, and the more derived type D in Hylobates, Gorilla gorilla, and Homo sapiens). The last derived stage, corresponding to the disappearance of the three atlantal ponticles (type H), was only observed in some individuals in hominoids. A marked intraspecific polymorphism characterized the hominoids. The presence of lateral and dorsal ponticles in humans appeared to correspond to their persistence within the progressive disappearance of the atlantal ponticles, constituting an evolutionary tendency characteristic of primates and particularly of hominoid evolution.

The method employs standard refractive light microscopy instead of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and all use-wear features are counted or scored under low magnification (35X). We use measurement systems analysis (variance components analysis of sources of measurement error) to evaluate the consistency and reproducibility of measurements using this method. The method is shown to have low intra- and inter-observer measurement error, and to effectively distinguish among graminivores, folivores, and frugivores. It can also be used to identify seed predators and to diagnose hard-object feeding. The method is also shown to be robust to the selection of measurement site; it works equally well when applied to upper or to lower molars. Finally, we use analysis of variance to examine the consistency of the signals across mammalian orders, and discriminant function analysis to develop dietary diagnostic tools for a set of ""classified"" primates with known diets. We test the success of these tools not merely by examining their a posteriori classification ""success,"" but by using them to construct predicted dietary profiles for a sample of unclassified extant primate species, again with known diets.

Meiosis progressed in two samples, but they lacked spermatogenesis. In the remaining four specimens, seminiferous tubules hyalinized without any sign of spermatogenesis. Second, seminiferous epithelia were thin even in the males in which spermatogenesis was observed. Third, degenerated seminiferous tubules were found in all specimens. Fourth, abnormally large syncytial cells were found in the tubules. Six stages in the epithelial cycle of the seminiferous tubules were identified. Testosterone staining made it clear that there were many Leydig cells with spherical or fusiform nuclei in an abundance of interstitial tissue.

Simulation of the population dynamics and social structure of the Virunga mountain gorillas,"['Robbins, MM', 'Robbins, AM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20052,AUG 2004,24,"An agent-based model was developed to simulate the growth rate, age structure, and social system of the endangered mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in the Virunga Volcanoes region. The model was used to compare two types of data: 1) estimates of the overall population size, age structure, and social structure, as measured by six censuses of the entire region that were conducted in 1971-2000; and 2) information about birth rates, mortality rates, dispersal patterns, and other life history events, as measured from three to five habituated research groups since 1967. On the basis of the research-group data, the ""base simulation"" predicted a higher growth rate than that observed from the census data (3% vs. 1%). This was as expected, because the research groups have indeed grown faster than the overall population. Additional simulations suggested that the research groups primarily have a lower mortality rate, rather than higher birth rates, compared to the overall population. Predictions from the base simulation generally fell within the range of census values for the average group size, the percentage of multimale groups, and the distribution of females among groups. However, other discrepancies predicted from the research-group data were a higher percentage of adult males than observed, an overestimation of the number of multimale groups with more than two silverbacks, and an overestimated number of groups with only two or three members. Possible causes for such discrepancies include inaccuracies in the census techniques used, and/or limitations with the long-term demographic data set obtained from only a few research groups of along-lived species. In particular, estimates of mortality and male dispersal obtained from the research groups may not be representative of the entire population. Our final simulation addressed these discrepancies, and provided a better basis for further studies on the complex relationships among individual life history events, group composition, population age structure, and growth rate patterns.

"Digesta passage, digestibility and behavior in captive gorillas under two dietary regimens","['Remis, MJ', 'Dierenfeld, ES']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/B:IJOP.0000029124.04610.c7,AUG 2004,33,"Gorilla adaptation has been debated in recent years given the wide variation among diets of gorillas in different habitats. Gorillas are the largest of living primates, have large colons and should be capable of processing tough foods. Preliminary captive studies have suggested that they may well have long average gut retention times relative to smaller hominoids, which should facilitate digestive efficiency in their wild counterparts. Indeed, wild gorillas consume large amounts of fibrous foods as staples or fall-back foods across their range, in response to habitat-related or seasonal changes in fruit availability. Fluctuations in diet might be matched by changes in digesta passage and digestibility, with possible selective retention of harder to digest items. We further studied digestive processes via chemical cobalt and chromium markers to track liquid and solids, as they passed through the guts of gorillas at the San Francisco Zoo (SFZ). In addition, we examined the effects of variation in captive diets on intake, digesta passage, digestion and behavior. The SFZ gorillas exhibited high digestibility coefficients, and gut passage was long relative to those of smaller-bodied hominoids. The results permit us to understand more fully the relationships of digestive processes to adaptation and dietary flexibility in the wild and to inform the development of dietary recommendations to improve the well-being of captive gorillas."

At Lokoue, breeding groups (mean size: 8.2 gorillas; range: 3-15) included a single silverback male and, on average, 3.2 adult females. Nonbreeding groups (mean size: 5.5; range: 2-15) were devoid of adult females. Five of the nonbreeding groups were composed predominantly of blackbacks, subadult males, and juveniles, and thus fit the definition of all-male groups previously observed in mountain gorillas. Our study confirms that 1) one-male breeding groups are the norm in western gorillas, and 2) all-male groups occur in this species. Despite frequent changes in members due to migrations of the males, the persistence of these all-male groups indicates that they may play an important role in the life of migrating males. Variations in population structure, and group composition and type among gorilla populations are discussed. However, a further understanding of the evolution of group-living in gorillas requires detailed ecological studies conducted in parallel with studies of the population structure and dynamics of these groups.

Nuclear integrations of mitochondrial DNA in gorillas,"['Jensen-Seaman, MI', 'Sarmiento, EE', 'Deinard, AS', 'Kidd, KK']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20047,JUL 2004,26,"Great ape systematics, particularly at the species level and below, is currently under debate, due in part to the recent influx of molecular data. The phylogenies of previously published mitochondrial control region (or D-loop) DNA sequences in gorillas show deep splits within West African gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and very high levels of nucleotide diversity in this subspecies. Here we demonstrate that several previously reported D-loop haplotypes from West African gorillas are in all likelihood nuclear integrations of mitochondrial DNA. Revised estimates of the amount and pattern of mitochondrial DNA diversity in gorillas are provided, revealing two reciprocally monophyletic and highly divergent groups of gorillas, concurrent with their geographic distribution.

Magnetic resonance (MR) images of three mountain gorilla brains were obtained with a 3T scanner, and the volume of major neuroanatomical structures (neocortical gray matter, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum) was measured. These data were included with our existing database that includes 23 chimpanzees, three western lowland gorillas, and six orang-utans. We defined a multidimensional space by calculating the principal components (PCs) from the correlation matrix of brain structure fractions in the well-represented sample of chimpanzees. We then plotted data from all of the taxa in this space to examine phyletic variation in neural organization. Most of the variance in mountain gorillas, as well as other great apes, was contained within the chimpanzee range along the first two PCs, which accounted for 61.73% of the total variance. Thus, the majority of interspecific variation in brain structure observed among these ape taxa was no greater than the within-species variation seen in chimpanzees. The loadings on PCs indicated that the brain structure of great apes differs among taxa mostly in the relative sizes of the striatum, cerebellum, and hippocampus. These findings suggest possible functional differences among taxa in terms of neural adaptations for ecological and locomotor capacities. Importantly, these results fill a critical gap in current knowledge regarding great ape neuroanatomical diversity. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

During a 2-week period in June 2002, shared habitat was substantiated by noting the ranging patterns of both species and recording observations and trail remains with a global positioning system (GPS). Parasite load was determined by collecting fecal samples preserved in 10% formalin and analyzed by sedimentation techniques and immunofluorescent antibodies (IFA). Bwindi baboons were infected with Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Eimeria, Ascaris spp., Strongyloides spp., Trichuris spp., Hymenolepis spp., and Ternidens diminuta. Of these, the Bwindi mountain gorillas had previously been found to carry Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Strongyloides spp., and Trichuris spp., but not Eimeria, Ascaris, Hymenolepis, or T diminuta. This study is the first to record Giardia in olive baboons and demonstrates that at least three parasite species in Bwindi baboons have yet to be found in Bwindi gorillas. Early monitoring is essential to the health and well being of both of these sympatric primate species, especially as they continue to interact more often and over a larger area.

"Ontogenetic allometry, heterochrony, and interspecific differences in the skull of African apes, using tridimensional Procrustes analysis","['Berge, C', 'Penin, X']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10333,JUN 2004,41,"Ontogenetic studies of African ape skulls lead to an analysis of morphological differences in terms of allometry, heterochrony, and sexual dimorphism. The use of geometric morphometrics allows us 1) to define size and shape variations as independent factors (an essential but seldom respected condition for heterochrony), and 2) to calculate in percentage of shape changes and to graphically represent the parts of shape variation which are related to various biological phenomena: common allometry, intraspecific allometry, and allometric and nonallometric shape discrimination. Three tridimensional Procrustes analyses and the calculation of multivariate allometries, discriminant functions, and statistical tests are used to compare the skulls of 50 Pan troglodytes, and 50 Gorilla gorilla of different dental stages. The results both complement and modify classical results obtained from similar material but with different methods (Shea [1983] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 62:275-289; Shea [1983] Folia Primatol. (Basel) 40:32-68; Shea [1985] Size and Scaling in Primate Morphology, New York: Plenum, p. 175-205). As previously described by Shea, the common growth allometric pattern is very important (64% of total shape variation). It corresponds to a larger increase of facial volume than of neurocranial volume, a more obliquely oriented foramen magnum, and a noticeable reshaping of the nuchal region (higher inion). However, the heterochronic interpretation based on common allometry is rather different from Shea. Gorillas differ from chimpanzees not only with a larger magnitude of allometric change (rate peramorphosis), as is classically said, but also grow more in size than in shape (size acceleration). In other words, for a similar stage of growth, gorillas have the size and shape corresponding to older chimpanzees, and for a similar shape, gorillas have a larger size than chimpanzees. In contrast, sexual dimorphism actually corresponds to allometric changes only, as classically demonstrated (time hypermorphosis). Sexual dimorphism is here significant in adult gorillas alone, and solely in terms of allometry (size-related shape and size, given that sagittal and nuchal crests are not taken into account). The study also permits us to differentiate two different shape variations that are classically confused in ontogenetic studies: a very small part of allometric shape change which is specific to each species (1% of the total shape variation), and nonallometric species-specific traits independent of growth (8% of total shape change). When calculated in terms of intraspecific allometries (including common allometry and noncommon allometry), shape changes are more extensive in gorillas (36% of total shape change) than in chimpanzees (29% of total shape change). The allometric differences mainly concern the inion, which becomes higher; the position of the foramen magnum, more dorsally oriented; and the palate, more tilted in adult gorillas than in adult chimpanzees. In contrast, nonallometric species-specific traits in gorillas are the long and flat vault characterized by a prominent occipital region, the higher and displaced backward glabella, and the protrusive nose. Biomechanical schemes built from shape partition suggest that the increased out-of-plumb position of the head during growth is partially compensated in gorillas by a powerful nuchal musculature due to the peculiar shape of the occipital region.

Interlaminar astroglial processes in the cerebral cortex of great apes,"['Colombo, JA', 'Sherwood, CC', 'Hof, PR']",ANATOMY AND EMBRYOLOGY,10.1007/s00429-004-0391-4,JUN 2004,3,"The present study was designed to document the architecture of neocortical astroglia in great apes, following glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry. These anthropoid species were missing from previous phylogenetic descriptions of astroglia with interlaminar processes, a characteristic event of the cerebral cortex within the Primate Order. Pongo pygmaeus (orangutan), Gorilla gorilla (gorilla) and Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee) brain samples showed the typical ""palisade"" of interlaminar processes. Yet, those from Pan troglodytes were less uniform, showing extended cortical segments with astrocytic (""syncytial-type"") appearance, intermingled with segments expressing the interlaminar ""palisade"". Present observations contribute to fill in missing data on the phylogenetic emergence of the cerebral cortex astroglial interlaminar processes. Considering the extreme consistency of the expression of astroglial interlaminar ""palisades"" among anthropoid species, this apparent variability among Pan individuals could be due to various possibilities, which are considered in this report."
Population genetic and phylogenetic evidence for positive selection on regulatory mutations at the Factor VII locus in humans,"['Hahn, MW', 'Rockman, MV', 'Soranzo, N', 'Goldstein, DB', 'Wray, GA']",GENETICS,10.1534/genetics.103.025726,JUN 2004,43,"The abundance of cis-regulatory polymorphisms in humans Suggests that many may have been important in human evolution, but evidence for their role is relatively rare. Four common polymorphisms in the 5' promoter region of factor VII (F7), a coagulation factor, bave been shown to affect its transcription and protein abundance both in vitro and in vivo. Three of these polymorphisms have low-frequency alleles that decrease expression of F7 and may provide protection against myocardial infarction (heart attacks). The fourth polymorphism has a minor allele that increases the level of transcription. To look for evidence of natural selection on the cis-regulatory variants flanking F7, we genotyped three of the polymorphisins in six Old World populations for which we also have data front a group of putatively neutral SNPs. Our population genetic analysis shows evidence for selection within humans; surprisingly, the strongest evidence is clue to a large increase in frequency of the high-expression variant in Singaporean Chinese. Further characterization of a japanese population shows that at least part of the increase in frequency of the high-expression allele is found in other East Asian populations. In addition, to examine interspecific patterns of selection we sequenced the homologous 5' noncoding region in chimpanzees, bonobos, a gorilla, an orangutan, and a baboon. Analysis of these data reveals an excess of fixed differences within transcription factor binding sites along the human lineage. Our results thus further support the hypothesis that regulatory mutations have been important in human evolution."

Here we report the first chromosomal-level comparison examining the Alu retroposition dynamics following the divergence of humans and chimpanzees. We find a twofold increase in Alu insertions in humans in comparison to the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The genomic diversity (polymorphism for presence or absence of the Alu insertion) associated with these inserts indicates that, analogous to recent nucleotide diversity studies, the level of chimpanzee Alu diversity is -1.7 times higher than that of humans. Evolutionarily recent Alu subfamily structure differs markedly between the human and chimpanzee lineages, with the major human subfamilies remaining largely inactive in the chimpanzee lineage. We propose a population-based model to account for the observed fluctuation in Alu retroposition rates across primate taxa."

A nucleotide sequence analysis of the two amplicons, tentatively named HLA-COQ and HLA-DEL, rendered them as two novel and seemingly related sequences, both with homology to the gorilla and human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) A locus. Exon 2 is similar to the published human pseudogenes HLA-BEL, HLA-Y, and to primate MHC Gogo-A*0501, differing by 2 bp from HLA-BEL, and HLA-Y, and by 4 bp from Gogo-A*0501. Exon 3 is most similar to HLA-A*2902 and A*310102, differing by 7 bp from A*2902, and by 8 bp from A*31012. Genomic sequence comparison of exons I to 8 indicates that their closest published match is to the Gogo-A*0501. Complete typing at the HLA-A, -B, -C, DRB1, and DRB5 loci for the six samples yielded the reoccurring types: HLA-A*3401, -B*1521/1525, -Cw*0403, -DRB1*150201, and DR135*010101. Thus far, HLA-COQ and HLA-DEL have been detected only in Filipino samples containing these HLA types. The HLA-COQ gene is nonfunctional based on a stop codon located in exon 4. HLA-DEL is also a nonfunctional gene because of the dual cytosine insertion in exon 4, with a reading frame shift generating a stop codon downstream. Parsimony analysis of the two pseudogenes with 31 other primate A locus coding regions resulted in a phylogenetic tree that segregated the two pseudogenes with the Gogo-A*0501, suggesting that HLA-COQ, HLA-DEL, and Gogo-A*0501 evolved from a common ancestral allele.

Visual information consisted of letting subjects look inside the cups. Auditory information consisted of shaking the cup so that the baited cup produced a rattling sound. Subjects correctly selected the baited cup both when they saw or heard the food. Nine individuals were above chance in both visual and auditory conditions. More important, subjects as a group selected the baited cup when only the empty cup was either shown or shaken, which means that subjects chose correctly without having seen or heard the food (i.e., inference by exclusion). Control tests showed that subjects were not more attracted to noisy cups, avoided shaken noiseless cups, or learned to use auditory information as a cue during the study. It is concluded that subjects understood that the food caused the noise, not simply that the noise was associated with the food."
Comparison of cranial ontogenetic trajectories among great apes and humans,"['Mitteroecker, P', 'Gunz, P', 'Bernhard, M', 'Schaefer, K', 'Bookstein, FL']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.03.006,JUN 2004,193,"Molecular data suggest that humans are more closely related to chimpanzees than either is to the gorillas, yet one finds the closest similarity in craniofacial morphology to be among the great apes to the exclusion of humans. To clarify how and when these differences arise in ontogeny, we studied ontogenetic trajectories for Homo sapiens, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus. A total of 96 traditional three-dimensional landmarks and semilandmarks on the face and cranial base were collected on 268 adult and sub-adult crania for a geometric morphometric analysis. The ontogenetic trajectories are compared by various techniques, including a new method, relative warps in size-shape space. We find that adult Homo sapiens specimens are clearly separated from the great apes in shape space and size-shape space. Around birth, Homo sapiens infants are already markedly different from the great apes, which overlap at this age but diverge among themselves postnatally. The results suggest that the small genetic differences between Homo and Pan affect early human ontogeny to induce the distinct adult human craniofacial morphology. Pure heterochrony does not sufficiently explain the human craniofacial morphology nor the differences among the African apes. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This study provides an alternative sedative regimen and yielded half-life data of transmucosal fentanyl in great apes. Although transmucosal fentanyl was a useful adjunct for sedating orangutans and gorillas, its acceptance by chimpanzees before chemical immobilization was suboptimal and unpredictable."

Nucleotide sequence variation was examined in the first hypervariable domain of the mitochondrial control region and was much higher in western lowland gorillas than in either of the other two subspecies. In addition to recapitulating the major evolutionary split between eastern and western lowland gorillas, phylogenetic analysis indicates a phylogeographical division within western lowland gorillas, one haplogroup comprising gorilla populations from eastern Nigeria through to southeast Cameroon and a second comprising all other western lowland gorillas. Within this second haplogroup, haplotypes appear to be partitioned geographically into three subgroups: (i) Equatorial Guinea, (ii) Central African Republic, and (iii) Gabon and adjacent Congo. There is also evidence of limited haplotype admixture in northeastern Gabon and southeast Cameroon. The phylogeographical patterns are broadly consistent with those predicted by current Pleistocene refuge hypotheses for the region and suggest that historical events have played an important role in shaping the population structure of this subspecies."

Variation in the allometric shape of the mandible is particularly important in hominid evolution because the mandible carries important taxonomic traits. Some of these traits are known to covary with size, particularly the retromolar space, symphyseal curvature, and position of the mental foramen. The mandible is a well studied system in the context of the evolutionary development of complex morphological structures because it is composed of different developmental units that are integrated within a single bone. In the present study, we investigated the allometric variation of two important developmental units that are separated by the inferior nerve (a branch of CN V3). We tested the null hypothesis that there would be no difference in allometric variation between the two components. Procrustes-based geometric morphometrics of 20 two-dimensional (2D) landmarks were analyzed by multivariate regressions of shape on size in samples from 121 humans, 48 chimpanzees, and 50 gorillas (all recent specimens), eight fossil hominids from Atapuerca, Sima de los Huesos (AT-SH), and 17 Neandertals. The findings show that in all of the examined species, there was significantly greater allometric variation in the supra-nerve unit than in the infra-nerve unit. The formation of the retromolar space exhibited an allometric relationship with the supra-nerve unit in all of the species studied. The formation of the chin-like morphology is an ""apodynamic"" feature of the infra-nerve unit in the AT-SH hominids. The results of this study support the hypothesis that allometry contributes to the organization of variation in complex morphological structures. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

The details of this important process are poorly understood in the human genome because allelic diversity complicates the interpretation of interparalog sequence differences. Here we exploit the haploid nature of the Y chromosome, which obviates complicating interallelic processes, together with its known phylogeny, to understand the dynamics of conversion between two directly repeated HERVs flanking the 780-kb AZFa region on Yq. Sequence analysis of a 787-bp segment of each of the HERVs in 36 Y chromosomes revealed one of the highest nucleotide diversities in the human genome, as well as evidence of a complex patchwork of highly directional gene conversion events. The rate of proximal-to-distal conversion events was estimated as 2.4 x 10(-4) to 1.2 x 10(-3) per generation (3.9 x 10(-7) to 1.9 X 10(-6) per base per generation), and the distal-to-proximal rate as about one-twentieth of this. Minimum observed conversion tract lengths ranged from 1 to 158 bp and maximum lengths from 19 to 1365 bp, with an estimated mean of 31 bp. Analysis of great ape homologs shows that conversion in this hotspot has a deep evolutionary history."
Testing the chromosomal speciation hypothesis for humans and chimpanzees,"['Zhang, JZ', 'Wang, XX', 'Podlaha, O']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.1891104,MAY 2004,38,"Fixed differences of chromosomal rearrangements between isolated Populations may promote speciation by preventing between-population gene flow upon secondary contact, either because hybrids suffer from lowered fitness or, more likely, because recombination is reduced in rearranged chromosomal regions. This chromosomal speciation hypothesis thus predicts more rapid genetic divergence on rearranged than on colinear chromosomes because the former are less porous to gene flow. A number of studies Of fungi, plants, and animals, including limited genetic data of humans and chimpanzees, support the hypothesis. Here we reexamine the hypothesis for humans and chimpanzees with substantially more genomic data than were used previously. No difference is observed between rearranged and colinear chromosomes in the level of genomic DNA sequence divergence between species. The same is also true for protein Sequences. When the gorilla is used as an outgroup, no acceleration in protein sequence evolution associated with chromosomal rearrangements is found. Furthermore, divergence in expression pattern between orthologous genes is not significantly different for rearranged and colinear chromosomes. These results, showing that chromosomal rearrangements did not affect the rate of genetic divergence between humans and chimpanzees, are expected if incipient species on the evolutionary lineages separating humans and chimpanzees did not hybridize."
Dental topography and diets of Australopithecus afarensis and early Homo,"['Ungar, P']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.03.004,MAY 2004,106,"Diet is key to understanding the paleoecology of early hominins. We know little about the diets of these fossil taxa, however, in part because of a limited fossil record, and in part because of limitations in methods available to infer their feeding adaptations. This paper applies a new method, dental topographic analysis, to the inference of diet from fossil hominin teeth. This approach uses laser scanning to generate digital 3D models of teeth and geographic information systems software to measure surface attributes, such as slope and occlusal relief. Because it does not rely on specific landmarks that change with wear, dental topographic analysis allows measurement and comparison of variably worn teeth, greatly increasing sample sizes compared with techniques that require unworn teeth. This study involved comparison of occlusal slope and relief of the lower second molars of Australopithecus afarensis (n=15) and early Homo (n=8) with those of Gorilla gorilla gorilla (n=47) and Pan troglodytes troglodytes (n=54). Results indicate that while all groups show reduced slope and relief in progressively more worn specimens, there are consistent differences at given wear stages among the taxa. Early Homo shows steeper slopes and more relief than chimpanzees, whereas A. afarensis shows less slope and relief than any of the other groups. The differences between the two hominin taxa are on the same order as those between the extant apes, suggesting similar degrees of difference in diet. Because these chimpanzees and gorillas differ mostly in fallback foods where they are sympatric, results suggest that the early hominins may likewise have differed mostly in fallback foods, with A. afarensis emphasizing harder, more brittle foods, and early Homo relying on tougher, more elastic foods.

Discriminatory PCRs identified STLV-1, STLV-3, and STLV-1 and STLV-3 in HTLV-1-, HTLV-2-, and HTLV-1- and HTLV-2-cross-reactive samples, respectively. We identified for the first time STLV-1 sequences in mustached monkeys (Cercopithecus cephus), talapoins (Miopithecus ogouensis), and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and confirmed STLV-1 infection in mandrills, African green monkeys, agile mangabeys, and crested mona and greater spot-nosed monkeys. STLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and env sequences revealed that the strains belonged to different PTLV-1 subtypes. A high prevalence of PTLV infection was observed among agile mangabeys (Cercocebus agilis); 89% of bush meat was infected with STLV. Cocirculation of STLV-1 and STLV-3 and STLV-1-STLV-3 coinfections were identified among the agile mangabeys. Phylogenetic analyses of partial LTR sequences indicated that the agile mangabey STLV-3 strains were more related to the STLV-3 CTO604 strain isolated from a red-capped mangabey (Cercocebus torquatus) from Cameroon than to the STLV-3 PH969 strain from an Eritrean baboon or the PPA-F3 strain from a baboon in Senegal. Our study documents for the first time that (i) a substantial proportion of wild-living monkeys in Cameroon is STLV infected, (ii) STLV-1 and STLV-3 cocirculate in the same primate species, (iii) coinfection with STLV-1 and STLV-3 occurs in agile mangabeys, and (iv) humans are exposed to different STLV-1 and STLV-3 subtypes through handling primates as bush meat."
Human-specific amino acid changes found in 103 protein-coding genes,"['Kitano, T', 'Liu, YH', 'Ueda, S', 'Saitou, N']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msh100,MAY 2004,21,"humans have many characteristics that are different from those of the great apes. These human-specific characters must have arisen through mutations accumulated in the genome of our direct ancestor after the divergence of the last common ancestor with chimpanzee. Gene trees of human and great apes are necessary for extracting these human-specific genetic changes. We conducted a systematic analysis of 103 protein-coding genes for human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. Nucleotide sequences for 18 genes were newly determined for this study, and those for the remaining genes were retrieved from the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database. The total number of amino acid changes in the human lineage was 147 for 26,199 codons (0.56%). The total number of amino acid changes in the human genome was, thus, estimated to be about 80,000. We applied the acceleration index test and Fisher's synonymous/nonsynonymous exact test for each gene tree to detect any human-specific enhancement of amino acid changes compared with ape branches. Six and two genes were shown to have significantly higher nonsynonymous changes at the human lineage from the acceleration index and exact tests, respectively. We also compared the distribution of the differences of the nonsynonymous substitutions on the human lineage and those on the great ape lineage. Two genes were more conserved in the ape lineage, whereas one gene was more conserved in the human lineage. These results suggest that a small proportion of protein-coding genes started to evolve differently in the human lineage after it diverged from the ape lineage."
Accelerated evolution of the ASPM gene controlling brain size begins prior to human brain expansion,"['Kouprina, N', 'Pavlicek, A', 'Mochida, GH', 'Solomon, G', 'Gersch, W', 'Yoon, YH', 'Collura, R', 'Ruvolo, M', 'Barrett, JC', 'Woods, CG', 'Walsh, CA', 'Jurka, J', 'Larionov, V']",PLOS BIOLOGY,10.1371/journal.pbio.0020126,MAY 2004,102,"Primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global reduction in cerebral cortical volume. The microcephalic brain has a volume comparable to that of early hominids, raising the possibility that some MCPH genes may have been evolutionary targets in the expansion of the cerebral cortex in mammals and especially primates. Mutations in ASPM, which encodes the human homologue of a fly protein essential for spindle function, are the most common known cause of MCPH. Here we have isolated large genomic clones containing the complete ASPM gene, including promoter regions and introns, from chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and rhesus macaque by transformation-associated recombination cloning in yeast. We have sequenced these clones and show that whereas much of the sequence of ASPM is substantially conserved among primates, specific segments are subject to high Ka/Ks ratios (nonsynonymous/synonymous DNA changes) consistent with strong positive selection for evolutionary change. The ASPM gene sequence shows accelerated evolution in the African hominoid clade, and this precedes hominid brain expansion by several million years. Gorilla and human lineages show particularly accelerated evolution in the IQ domain of ASPM. Moreover, ASPM regions under positive selection in primates are also the most highly diverged regions between primates and nonprimate mammals. We report the first direct application of TAR cloning technology to the study of human evolution. Our data suggest that evolutionary selection of specific segments of the ASPM sequence strongly relates to differences in cerebral cortical size."
Fracture toughness of mountain gorilla (Gorilla gorilla beringei) food plants,"['Elgart-Berry, A']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20021,APR 2004,31,"Mountain gorillas, the largest extant primates, subsist almost entirely on plant matter. Moreover, their diet includes a substantial amount of structural material, such as bark and stems, which other primates tend to avoid. Accordingly, the robust masticatory apparatus of gorillas may be adaptive to this presumably tough diet; however, quantitative information on this subject is lacking. In this study the fracture toughness of mountain gorilla foods was examined for the first time. Samples of 44 food plants from Bwindi-Impenetrable National Park (BINP) and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park (MGNP) were tested. These parks are inhabited by two gorilla populations that regarded by some as being distinct at the subspecific taxonomic level. Although food toughness did not differ between the two populations, both diets contained tough items. Tree barks were the toughest food items (varying from 0.23 to 8.2 kJ/m(2)), followed by shrub barks, pith, and stems. The toughness of leaves and fruit was negligible compared to that of bark. The toughness of bamboo was low in comparison to the toughest food items. Accordingly, the prominent toughness of bark, pith, and stems may be key factors in the evolution of orofacial robusticity in mountain gorillas. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Long-term retention of the differential values of Arabic numerals by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Beran, MJ']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-003-0191-x,APR 2004,13,"As previously reported (Beran and Rumbaugh, 2001), two chimpanzees used a joystick to collect dots, one-at-a-time, on a computer monitor, and then ended a trial when the number of dots collected was equal to the Arabic numeral presented for the trial. Here, the chimpanzees were presented with the task again after an interval of 6 months and then again after an additional interval of 3.25 years. During each interval, the chimpanzees were not presented with the task, and this allowed an assessment of the extent to which both animals retained the values of each Arabic numeral. Despite lower performance at each retention interval compared to the original study, both chimpanzees performed above chance levels in collecting a quantity of dots equal to the target numeral, one chimpanzee for the numerals 1-7, and the second chimpanzee for the numerals 1-6. For the 3.25-year retention, errors were more dispersed around each target numeral than in the original study, but the chimpanzees' performances again appeared to be based on a continuous representation of magnitude rather than a discrete representation of number. These data provide an experimental demonstration of long-term retention of the differential values of Arabic numerals by chimpanzees."
Event memory and misinformation effects in a gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Schwartz, BL', 'Meissner, CA', 'Hoffman, M', 'Evans, S', 'Frazier, LD']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-003-0194-7,APR 2004,14,"Event memory and misinformation effects were examined in an adult male gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). The gorilla witnessed a series of unique events, involving a familiar person engaging in a novel behavior (experiment 1), a novel person engaging in a novel behavior (experiment 2), or the presentation of a novel object (experiment 3). Following a 5- to 10-min retention interval, a tester gave the gorilla three photographs mounted on wooden cards: a photograph depicting the correct person or object and two distractor photographs drawn from the same class. The gorilla responded by returning a photograph. If correct, he was reinforced with food. Across three experiments, the gorilla performed significantly above chance at recognizing the target photograph. In experiment 4, the gorilla showed at-chance performance when the event was followed by misinformation (a class-consistent, but incorrect photograph), but significantly above-chance performance when no misinformation occurred (either correct photograph or no photograph). Although the familiarity can account for these data, they are also consistent with an episodic-memory interpretation."

Relatively few studies, however, provide such information. We present the results of a survey of the densities of two great ape species, the gorilla Gorilla gorilla gorilla and chimpanzee Pan troglodytes troglodytes, in a non-protected area on the northern periphery of Dja Faunal Reserve, Cameroon. Densities of chimpanzees and gorillas were estimated to be 1.1 and 3.8 weaned individuals per km(2), respectively. The results confirm that gorillas prefer building nests in vegetation types with limited visibility, and that within preferred vegetation types for nesting, gorillas select patches that are the most difficult to penetrate, resulting in less conspicuous nests. Although the opposite tendencies were exhibited by chimpanzees, no firm conclusions could be drawn from our data. Despite its non-protected status and past and ongoing logging activities in the area, the densities of gorillas and chimpanzees on the northern periphery of Dja Faunal Reserve are comparable to those found within the reserve itself, indicating the need for developing alternative conservation action to protect these important populations. The creation of a Communal Wildlife Zone in this area is legislatively possible, and could be an effective conservation tool. because it has to originate from the local people."

Here we address these problems by using morphometric data. Three-dimensional landmark data from the hominoid temporal bone effectively quantify the shape of a complex element of the skull. Phylogenetic analysis using distance-based methods corroborates the molecular consensus on African ape and human phylogeny strongly supporting a Pan-Homo clade. Phenetic differentiation of great ape subspecies is pronounced, as suggested previously by mitochondrial DNA and some morphological studies. These results show that the hominoid temporal bone contains a strong phylogenetic signal and reveal the potential for geometric morphometric analysis to shed light on phylogenetic relationships."

Dispersed male networks in western gorillas,"['Bradley, BJ', 'Doran-Sheehy, DM', 'Lukas, D', 'Boesch, C', 'Vigilant, L']",CURRENT BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cub.2004.02.062,MAR 23 2004,85,"Although kin-selection theory has been widely used to explain the tendency of individuals to bias beneficial behaviors towards relatives living within the same social group [1], less attention has focused on kin-biased interactions between groups. For animal societies in which females emigrate, as is the case for mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), encounters between males in different groups often involve aggressive displays that can escalate to physical violence and fatal injuries [2, 3]. However, recent findings on the little-studied western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) indicate that interactions between social groups occur more frequently than they do in mountain gorillas and are often [4, 5], although not always [5, 6], surprisingly nonaggressive. We investigated the pattern of genetic relationships between individuals of different groups and found evidence suggesting a previously unrecognized ""dispersed male network"" social structure in western gorillas in which the single males leading social groups were usually related to one or more nearby males. We propose that this provides a basis for extra-group, kin-biased behaviors and may explain the reported peaceful intergroup interactions. Furthermore, these results suggest that a patrilocal social structure, in which males remain in their natal region and potentially benefit from kin associations, is a feature unifying African apes and humans."

Naturally acquired simian retrovirus infections in central African hunters,"['Wolfe, ND', 'Switzer, WM', 'Carr, JK', 'Bhullar, VB', 'Shanmugam, V', 'Tamoufe, U', 'Prosser, AT', 'Torimiro, JN', 'Wright, A', 'Mpoudi-Ngole, E', 'McCutchan, FE', 'Birx, DL', 'Folks, TM', 'Burke, DS', 'Heneine, W']",LANCET,10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15787-5,MAR 20 2004,220,"Background Hunting and butchering of wild non-human primates infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is thought to have sparked the HIV pandemic. Although SIV and other primate retroviruses infect laboratory workers and zoo workers, zoonotic retrovirus transmission has not been documented in natural settings. We investigated zoonotic infection in individuals living in central Africa.

Methods We obtained behavioural data, plasma samples, and peripheral blood lymphocytes from individuals living in rural villages in Cameroon. We did serological testing, PCR, and sequence analysis to obtain evidence of retrovirus infection.

Findings Zoonotic infections with simian foamy virus (SFV), a retrovirus endemic in most Old World primates, were identified in people living in central African forests who reported direct contact with blood and body fluids of wild non-human primates. Ten (1%) of 1099 individuals had antibodies to SFV. Sequence analysis from these individuals revealed three geographically-independent human SFV infections, each of which was acquired from a distinct non-human primate lineage: De Brazza's guenon (Cercopithecus neglectus), mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx), and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), two of which (De Brazza's guenon and mandrill) are naturally infected with SIV.

Interpretation Our findings show that retroviruses are actively crossing into human populations, and demonstrate that people in central Africa are currently infected with SFV. Contact with non-human primates, such as happens during hunting and butchering, can play a part in the emergence of human retroviruses and the reduction of primate bushmeat hunting has the potential to decrease the frequency of. disease emergence."
Analysis of common IL-6 promoter SNP variants and the AnTn tract in humans and primates and effects on plasma IL-6 levels following coronary artery bypass graft surgery,"['Kelberman, D', 'Fife, M', 'Rockman, MV', 'Brull, DJ', 'Woo, P', 'Humphries, SE']",BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR BASIS OF DISEASE,10.1016/j.bbadis.2003.11.010,MAR 2 2004,24,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and major mediator of the acute phase response. Single nucleotide polymorphisms within the 5' flanking region (-597G>A, -572G>C and -174G>C) have previously been associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease and influencing transcription of IL-6 both in vitro and in vivo. In addition to these, a polymorphic AnTn tract is also present in the promoter of IL-6. Analysis in five different primate species demonstrated a G allele at -597, -572 and -174 in all species. By contrast, the AnTn tract was polymorphic in at least three species, and was roughly conserved in overall length despite an increase in the relative proportion of A versus T in the evolution of the human sequence from that in the ancestor of the great apes. The effect of the AnTn polymorphism on IL-6 levels was examined following coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), a known inflammatory stimulus for IL-6 production. One hundred and thirty-two patients undergoing CABG were genotyped for the AnTn tract by automated sequencing. Four alleles were identified: A8T12 (allele frequency 0.35, 95% CI 0.29-0.40); A9T11 (0.26, 0.21-0.31); A10T11 (0.21, 0.16-0.26); and A10T10 (0.18, 0.14-0.23). Isolation of the effect of different alleles of the AnTn tract on an identical haplotypic background for the other polymorphisms in the promoter showed that individuals homozygous for A9T11 had significantly higher post-operative IL-6 levels than A10T11 homozygotes (275 +/- 46 pg/ml versus 152 +/- 29; P = 0.04). The effect of the A8T12 allele could not be determined separately due to strong allelic association with -174C. The conserved length of the AnTn tract and the association in vivo with IL-6 levels strongly suggest the functionality of the tract on IL-6 expression, independent of contributions from other polymorphic sites within the promoter.

The SPANX gene family of cancer/testis-specific antigens: Rapid evolution and amplification in African great apes and hominids,"['Kouprina, N', 'Mullokandov, M', 'Rogozin, IB', 'Collins, NK', 'Solomon, G', 'Otstot, J', 'Risinger, JI', 'Koonin, EV', 'Barrett, JC', 'Larionov, V']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0308532100,MAR 2 2004,40,"Human sperm protein associated with the nucleus on the X chromosome (SPANX) genes comprise a gene family with five known members (SPANX-A1, -A2, -B, -C and -D), encoding cancer/testis-specific antigens that are potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. These highly similar paralogous genes cluster on the X chromosome at Xq27. We isolated and sequenced primate genomic clones homologous to human SPANX Analysis of these clones and search of the human genome sequence revealed an uncharacterized group of genes, SPANX-N, which are present in all primates as well as in mouse and rat. In humans, four SPANX-N genes comprise a series of tandem duplicates at Xq27; a fifth member of this subfamily is located at Xp11. Similarly to SPANX-A/D, human SPANX-N genes are expressed in normal testis and some melanoma cell lines; testis-specific expression of SPANX is also conserved in mouse. Analysis of the taxonomic distribution of the long and short forms of the intron indicates that SPANX-N is the ancestral form, from which the SPANX-A/D subfamily evolved in the common ancestor of the hominoid lineage. Strikingly, the coding sequences of the SPANX genes evolved much faster than the intron and the 5' untranslated region. There is a strong correlation between the rates of evolution of synonymous and nonsynonymous codon positions, both of which are accelerated 2-fold or more compared to the noncoding sequences. Thus, evolution of the SPANX family appears to have involved positive selection that affected not only the protein sequence but also the synonymous sites in the coding sequence."
Human impact on wildlife populations within a protected Central African forest,"['Blom, A', 'van Zalinge, R', 'Mbea, E', 'Heitkonig, IMA', 'Prins, HHT']",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.0141-6707.2004.00441.x,MAR 2004,29,"This paper addresses the effect of human activities on the density of large mammals in the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park and the adjacent Dzanga-Sangha Reserve in the Central African Republic.

Between six and eight 20 km long permanent transects were walked on a monthly basis from January 1997 to August 1999 to assess large mammal populations as well as human intrusion. There were no obvious seasonal or monthly trends in elephant, gorilla or non-human primate densities.

Overall, it appears that human activities negatively influence the distribution of most of the large forest animals in Dzanga-Sangha. Elephants in particular were significantly less common in areas used by humans, but also other species such as non-human primates showed lower densities closer to the main road and the town of Bayanga. This study confirms the findings of previous studies that roads have a negative impact on wildlife populations.

Results of this study stress the need for conservation of large uninterrupted forest blocks to maintain wildlife populations at normal levels. Simply creating roads, even within a protected Central African forest, is likely to have negative impacts on wildlife populations."
"Hypothesis for the causes and periodicity of repetitive linear enamel hypoplasia in large, wild African (Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla) and Asian (Pongo pygmaeus) apes","['Skinner, MF', 'Hopwood, D']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10314,MAR 2004,31,"Repetitive linear enamel hypoplasia (rLEH) is often observed in recent large-bodied apes from Africa and Asia as well as Mid- to Late Miocene sites from Spain to China. The ubiquity and periodicity of rLEH are not understood. Its potential as an ontogenetic marker of developmental stress in threatened species (as well as their ancient relatives) makes rLEH an important if enigmatic problem. We report research designed to show the periodicity of rLEH among West African Pan troglodytes (12 male, 32 female), Gorilla gorilla (10 male, 10 female), and Bornean and Sumatran Pongo pygmaeus (11 male, 9 female, 9 unknown) from collections in Europe. Two methods were employed. In the common chimpanzees and gorillas, the space between adjacent, macroscopically visible LEH grooves on teeth with two or more episodes was expressed as an absolute measure and as a ratio of complete unworn crown height. In the orangutans, the number of perikymata between episode onsets, as well as duration of rLEH, was determined from scanning electron micrographs of casts of incisors and canines. We conclude that stress in the form of LEH commences as early as 2.5 years of age in all taxa and lasts for several years, and even longer in orangutans; the stress is not chronic but episodic; the stressor has a strong tendency to occur in pulses of two occurrences each; and large apes from both land masses exhibit rLEH with an average periodicity of 6 months (or multiples thereof, Sumatran orangutans seem to show only annual stress), but this needs further research. This is supported by evidence of spacing between rLEH as well as perikymata counts. Duration of stress in orangutans averages about 6 weeks. Finally, the semiannual stressor transcends geographic and temporal boundaries, and is attributed to regular moisture cycles associated with the intertropical convergence zone modified by the monsoon. While seasonal cycles can influence both disease and nutritional stress, it is likely the combination of seasonal variation in fruiting cycles with specific stressors (malaria and/or intestinal parasites, especially hookworm) that results in this widespread phenomenon. This seasonal stress is sufficiently common and of long duration (6 weeks on average in orangutans) that we think rLEH may reflect significant stress in recent and, inferentially, fossil apes. Increasing seasonality may have impinged negatively on later Miocene apes, especially if they lacked a clear birth peak or seasonality in their reproductive cycles. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Of these, 9 matched the 3' region of the dynamin 1 gene (DNM1) on chromosome 9q34 with >90% identity. Fluoresence in situ hybridisation and PCR amplification were used to localise a large number of DNM1-like sequences to human chromosomes 15 and Y PCR amplification of overlapping Y-linked YACs allowed a more accurate mapping of the Y-linked DNM1-like cDNAs to a euchromatic locus in close proximity to heterochromatin at Yq11.23. A search of the genome database identified 64 highly homologous copies of the DNM1 fragment. Most of these copies were localised to chromosomes 15 and Y, but others mapped to chromosomes 5, 8, 10, 12, 19 and 22. These sequences exhibit all the major features of a duplicon and have been designated DNM1DN (DNM1 duplicon). Evolutionary studies using fluorescence in situ hybridisation indicate that transposition of the DNM1DN sequence to chromosome 15 took place earlier in primate evolution than the transposition to the Y chromosome. The translocation to the Y took place at a time following the divergence of a common ancestor from gorilla, approximately 4-7 million years ago."
Nucleotide diversity in gorillas,"['Yu, N', 'Jensen-Seaman, MI', 'Chemnick, L', 'Ryder, O', 'Li, WH']",GENETICS,10.1534/genetics.166.3.1375,MAR 2004,50,"Comparison of the levels of nucleotide diversity in humans and apes may provide valuable information for inferring the demographic history of these species, the effect of social structure on genetic diversity, patterns of past migration, and signatures of past selection events. Previous DNA sequence data from both the mitochondrial and the nuclear genomes suggested a much higher level of nucleotide diversity in the African apes than in humans. Noting that the nuclear DNA data from the apes were very limited, we previously conducted a DNA polymorphism study in humans and another in chimpanzees and bonobos, using 50 DNA segments randomly chosen from the noncoding, nonrepetitive parts of the human genome. The data revealed that the nucleotide diversity (pi) in bonobos (0.077%) is actually lower that) that in humans (0.087%) and that pi in chimpanzees (0.134%) is only 50% higher than that in humans. In the present study we sequenced the same 50 segments in 15 western lowland gorillas and estimated pi to be 0.158%. This is the highest value among the African apes but is only about two times higher than that in humans. Interestingly, available mtDNA sequence data also suggest a twofold higher nucleotide diversity in gorillas than in humans, but suggest a threefold higher nucleotide diversity in chimpanzees than in humans. The higher mtDNA diversity in chimpanzees might be due to the unique pattern in the evolution of chimpanzee mtDNA. From the nuclear DNA pi values, we estimated that the long-term effective population sizes Of humans, bonobos, chimpanzees, and gorillas are, respectively, 10,400, 12,300, 21,300, and 25,200."

Frequent simian foamy virus infection in persons occupationally exposed to nonhuman primates,"['Switzer, WM', 'Bhullar, V', 'Shanmugam, V', 'Cong, ME', 'Parekh, B', 'Lerche, NW', 'Yee, JAL', 'Ely, JJ', 'Boneva, R', 'Chapman, LE', 'Folks, TM', 'Heneine, W']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.78.6.2780-2789.2004,MAR 2004,135,"The recognition that AIDS originated as a zoonosis heightens public health concerns associated with human infection by simian retroviruses endemic in nonhuman primates (NHPs). These retroviruses include simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV), simian type D retrovirus (SRV), and simian foamy virus (SFV). Although occasional infection with SIV, SRV, or SFV in persons occupationally exposed to NHPs has been reported, the characteristics and significance of these zoonotic infections are not fully defined. Surveillance for simian retroviruses at three research centers and two zoos identified no SIV, SRV, or STLV infection in 187 participants. However, 10 of 187 persons (5.3%) tested positive for SFV antibodies by Western blot (WB) analysis. Eight of the 10 were males, and 3 of the 10 worked at zoos. SFV integrase gene (int) and gag sequences were PCR amplified from the peripheral blood lymphocytes available from 9 of the 10 persons. Phylogenetic analysis showed SFV infection originating from chimpanzees (n = 8) and baboons (n = 1). SFV seropositivity for periods of 8 to 26 years (median, 22 years) was documented for six workers for whom archived serum samples were available, demonstrating long-standing SFV infection. All 10 persons reported general good health, and secondary transmission of SFV was not observed in three wives available for WB and PCR testing. Additional phylogenetic analysis of int and gag sequences provided the first direct evidence identifying the source chimpanzees of the SFV infection in two workers. This study documents more frequent infection with SFV than with other simian retroviruses in persons working with NHPs and provides important information on the natural history and species origin of these infections. Our data highlight the importance of studies to better define the public health implications of zoonotic SFV infections."
Reversal of neurologic deficit in an adult gorilla with severe symptomatic lumbar stenosis,"['Wolfla, CE', 'Puckett, TA']",SPINE,10.1097/01.BRS.0000112075.03500.5B,MAR 1 2004,0,"Study Design. A case report is presented.

Objective. To describe a case of severe symptomatic lumbar stenosis in an adult gorilla successfully treated with decompressive surgery.

Summary of Background Data. Although spinal degenerative disease is thought to be less common in apes than in humans, gorillas and bonobos are known to have higher rates of disease than other African apes.

Methods. A 42-year-old female gorilla presented with a history of progressive lower extremity weakness. She was unable to ambulate normally or climb, pulling herself around with her arms. Her keeper did not believe she was incontinent. Physical examination revealed that ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion were absent on the right and weak on the left. Radiographs revealed disc space narrowing with osteophytes at the last mobile segment. Myelogram and computed tomography revealed severe spinal stenosis at the last two mobile segments. Under general anesthesia, a standard laminectomy and bilateral lateral recess decompression were performed.

Results. There were no anesthetic or wound complications. The gorilla was noted to have improved ankle strength bilaterally on postoperative day 1. On postoperative day 3, the animal began to walk and climb. At 20 months, the animal is back to her neurologic baseline.

Conclusions. Symptomatic lumbar degenerative disease with neurologic compromise may be treated surgically, with excellent outcome, in the adult gorilla. Though this is an unusual situation, knowledge that this is a potentially reversible condition may benefit other gorillas in captivity."
Sexual behavior and hormonal estrus cycles in captive aged lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla),"['Atsalis, S', 'Margulis, SW', 'Bellem, A', 'Wielebnowski, N', 'MENOPAUSE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20010,FEB 2004,18,"To evaluate whether observed cycles in proceptive behavior in aging lowland gorilla females (age 40+) at Brookfield Zoo were driven by ovarian activity, we compared monthly behavioral data to estradiol and progestogen cycles based on fecal hormone assessments. Progestogen peaks showed regularity and close coincidence with monthly sexual behaviors. Estradiol was more variable. Progestogen peaks varied between 22+/-5 days for the control female (29 years old), to 24+/-2.5 and 29+/-8 for the two aged subjects. In the first aged female, which was housed with other females and a silverback, the high degree of cyclicity in sexual behavior, regularity of progestogen cycles, and close concordance between hormonal cycling and sexual behavior strongly compared to patterns found (in this and other studies) in gorilla females < 35 years old. Cyclical progestogen peaks were longer and more variable in the second aged female-perhaps because she lacked the social mediation of other females or a male. For husbandry reasons she is not housed with the gorilla group, behavioral data were not collected from her. The value of our longitudinal study is in obtaining reproductive profiles of primate females that are approaching maximum lifespan. This pilot study is part of a larger research project on reproductive senescence that will include other captive females > 35 years old, a population that is rapidly increasing in North American zoos as gorillas continue to age.

Phylogenetic relationships in the Lymphocryptovirus genus of the Gammaherpesvirinae,"['Gerner, CS', 'Dolan, A', 'McGeoch, DJ']",VIRUS RESEARCH,10.1016/j.viruses.2003.10.011,FEB 2004,17,"Complete DNA sequences were determined for the glycoprotein B (gB) genes of four viruses from the genus Lymphocryptovirus, whose hosts had been assigned as baboon, orangutan, chimpanzee and gorilla. Together with published sequences for the gB genes of three lymphocryptoviruses, namely the human pathogen Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a rhesus monkey virus and a marmoset virus, the sequences were used to investigate evolutionary relationships in the genus. The chimpanzee and orangutan viruses' sequences were found to be so close that it is unlikely both represent natural infections in these hosts. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the New World marmoset virus lineage formed a sister clade to that of the Old World viruses, consistent with a cospeciational separation. Within the Old World virus group, resolution of branching pattern was incomplete, and suggestive of a complex history. In particular, it was inferred that separation of the EBV lineage from that of the gorilla virus plus the chimpanzee/orangutan virus may have predated separation of the present day host species.

Multiple Ebola virus transmission events and rapid decline of central African wildlife,"['Leroy, EM', 'Rouquet, P', 'Formenty, P', 'Souquiere, S', 'Kilbourne, A', 'Froment, JM', 'Bermejo, M', 'Smit, S', 'Karesh, W', 'Swanepoel, R', 'Zaki, SR', 'Rollin, PE']",SCIENCE,10.1126/science.1092528,JAN 16 2004,247,"Several human and animal Ebola outbreaks have occurred over the past 4 years in Gabon and the Republic of Congo. The human outbreaks consisted of multiple simultaneous epidemics caused by different viral strains, and each epidemic resulted from the handling of a distinct gorilla, chimpanzee, or duiker carcass. These animal populations declined markedly during human Ebola outbreaks, apparently as a result of Ebola infection. Recovered carcasses were infected by a variety of Ebola strains, suggesting that Ebola outbreaks in great apes result from multiple virus introductions from the natural host. Surveillance of animal mortality may help to predict and prevent human Ebola outbreaks."
PyEvolve: a toolkit for statistical modelling of molecular evolution,"['Butterfield, A', 'Vedagiri, V', 'Lang, E', 'Lawrence, C', 'Wakefield, MJ', 'Isaev, A', 'Huttley, GA']",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,10.1186/1471-2105-5-1,JAN 5 2004,21,"Background: Examining the distribution of variation has proven an extremely profitable technique in the effort to identify sequences of biological significance. Most approaches in the field, however, evaluate only the conserved portions of sequences - ignoring the biological significance of sequence differences. A suite of sophisticated likelihood based statistical models from the field of molecular evolution provides the basis for extracting the information from the full distribution of sequence variation. The number of different problems to which phylogeny-based maximum likelihood calculations can be applied is extensive. Available software packages that can perform likelihood calculations suffer from a lack of flexibility and scalability, or employ error-prone approaches to model parameterisation.

Results: Here we describe the implementation of PyEvolve, a toolkit for the application of existing, and development of new, statistical methods for molecular evolution. We present the object architecture and design schema of PyEvolve, which includes an adaptable multi-level parallelisation schema. The approach for defining new methods is illustrated by implementing a novel dinucleotide model of substitution that includes a parameter for mutation of methylated CpG's, which required 8 lines of standard Python code to define. Benchmarking was performed using either a dinucleotide or codon substitution model applied to an alignment of BRCA1 sequences from 20 mammals, or a 10 species subset. Up to five-fold parallel performance gains over serial were recorded. Compared to leading alternative software, PyEvolve exhibited significantly better real world performance for parameter rich models with a large data set, reducing the time required for optimisation from similar to10 days to similar to6 hours.

Conclusion: PyEvolve provides flexible functionality that can be used either for statistical modelling of molecular evolution, or the development of new methods in the field. The toolkit can be used interactively or by writing and executing scripts. The toolkit uses efficient processes for specifying the parameterisation of statistical models, and implements numerous optimisations that make highly parameter rich likelihood functions solvable within hours on multi-cpu hardware. PyEvolve can be readily adapted in response to changing computational demands and hardware configurations to maximise performance.

Sex differences in play among western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) infants: Implications for adult behavior and social structure,"['Maestripieri, D', 'Ross, SR']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10295,JAN 2004,26,"Mammalian play is believed to improve motor skills as well as facilitate the development of social relationships. Given the marked sexual dimorphism in gorilla body size and the role assumed by the male in protecting the group from conspecifics and predators, the motor-training hypothesis of play predicts that male infants should exhibit higher frequencies of social play than female infants, and that males should prefer to play with other males. Given that adult female gorillas are strongly attracted to adult breeding males and form only weak social bonds with unrelated adult females, the social-relationship hypothesis of play predicts that female infants should prefer to play with males. These hypotheses were tested in a 22-month study of 12 gorilla infants, aged between 0-5 years, living in three zoological parks in Chicago and Atlanta. Consistent with the hypotheses, male infants played more than female infants did, and both male and female infants preferred to play with males rather than with females. These findings suggest that sex differences in play in the great apes and other primates can be predicted by the characteristics of adult behavior and social structure above and beyond the patterns of sex-biased dispersal or coalition formation with same-sex kin.

The animal described here showed similar features to cases of trisomy 16 and 18 (human trisomy 13 and 18, respectively) reported previously in nonhuman primates. However, both significant differences and similarities were found when compared with the homologous human trisomy. Evaluation of the genetic components of these disorders as well as systematic developmental evaluation can lead to new insights into the genetic basis of speciation, development, and the underlying differences between humans and their closest living relatives."

Quantitative analysis of cytoarchitecture","['Sherwood, CC', 'Holloway, RL', 'Erwin, JM', 'Schleicher, A', 'Zilles, K', 'Hof, PR']",BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION,10.1159/000075672,2004,30,"Social life in anthropoid primates is mediated by interindividual communication, involving movements of the orofacial muscles for the production of vocalization and gestural expression. Although phylogenetic diversity has been reported in the auditory and visual communication systems of primates, little is known about the comparative neuroanatomy that subserves orofacial movement. The current study reports results from quantitative image analysis of the region corresponding to orofacial representation of primary motor cortex (Brodmann's area 4) in several catarrhine primate species (Macaca fascicularis, Papio anubis, Pongo pygmaeus, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Homo sapiens) using the Grey Level Index method. This cortical region has been implicated in the execution of skilled motor activities such as voluntary facial expression and human speech. Density profiles of the laminar distribution of Nissl-stained neuronal somata were acquired from high-resolution images to quantify cytoarchitectural patterns. Despite general similarity in these profiles across catarrhines, multi-variate analysis showed that cytoarchitectural patterns of individuals were more similar within-species versus between-species. Compared to Old World monkeys, the orofacial representation of area 4 in great apes and humans was characterized by an increased relative thickness of layer III and overall lower cell volume densities, providing more neuropil space for interconnections. These phylogenetic differences in microstructure might provide an anatomical substrate for the evolution of greater volitional fine motor control of facial expressions in great apes and humans.

"Cortical orofacial motor representation in old world monkeys, great apes, and humans - II. Stereologic analysis of chemoarchitecture","['Sherwood, CC', 'Holloway, RL', 'Erwin, JM', 'Hof, PR']",BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION,10.1159/000075673,2004,36,"This study presents a comparative stereologic investigation of neurofilament protein- and calcium-binding protein-immunoreactive neurons within the region of orofacial representation of primary motor cortex (Brodmann's area 4) in several catarrhine primate species (Macaca fascicularis, Papio anubis, Pongo pygmaeus, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Homo sapiens). Results showed that the density of interneurons involved in vertical interlaminar processing (i.e., calbindin- and calretinin-immunoreactive neurons) as well pyramidal neurons that supply heavily-myelinated projections (i.e., neurofilament protein- immunoreactive neurons) are correlated with overall neuronal density, whereas interneurons making transcolumnar connections (i.e., parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons) do not exhibit such a relationship. These results suggest that differential scaling rules apply to different neuronal subtypes depending on their functional role in cortical circuitry. For example, cortical columns across catarrhine species appear to involve a similar conserved network of intracolumnar inhibitory interconnections, as represented by the distribution of calbindin- and calretinin-immunoreactive neurons. The subpopulation of horizontally-oriented wide-arbor interneurons, on the other hand, increases in density relative to other interneuron subpopulations in large brains. Due to these scaling trends, the region of orofacial representation of primary motor cortex in great apes and humans is characterized by a greater proportion of neurons enriched in neurofilament protein and parvalbumin compared to the Old World monkeys examined. These modifications might contribute to the voluntary dexterous control of orofacial muscles in great ape and human communication. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel."

Hotspots of mammalian chromosomal evolution,"['Bailey, JA', 'Baertsch, R', 'Kent, WJ', 'Haussler, D', 'Eichler, EE']",GENOME BIOLOGY,10.1186/gb-2004-5-4-r23,2004,139,"Background: Chromosomal evolution is thought to occur through a random process of breakage and rearrangement that leads to karyotype differences and disruption of gene order. With the availability of both the human and mouse genomic sequences, detailed analysis of the sequence properties underlying these breakpoints is now possible.

Results: We report an abundance of primate-specific segmental duplications at the breakpoints of syntenic blocks in the human genome. Using conservative criteria, we find that 25% (122/461) of all breakpoints contain greater than or equal to 10 kb of duplicated sequence. This association is highly significant ( p < 0.0001) when compared to a simulated random-breakage model. The significance is robust under a variety of parameters, multiple sets of conserved synteny data, and for orthologous breakpoints between and within chromosomes. A comparison of mouse lineage-specific breakpoints since the divergence of rat and mouse showed a similar association with regions associated with segmental duplications in the primate genome.

Conclusion: These results indicate that segmental duplications are associated with syntenic rearrangements, even when pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions are excluded. However, segmental duplications are not necessarily the cause of the rearrangements. Rather, our analysis supports a nonrandom model of chromosomal evolution that implicates specific regions within the mammalian genome as having been predisposed to both recurrent small-scale duplication and large-scale evolutionary rearrangements."
Origins of chromosomal rearrangement hotspots in the human genome: evidence from the AZFa deletion hotspots,"['Hurles, ME', 'Willey, D', 'Matthews, L', 'Hussain, SS']",GENOME BIOLOGY,10.1186/gb-2004-5-8-r55,2004,24,"Background: The origins of the recombination hotspots that are a common feature of both allelic and non-allelic homologous recombination in the human genome are poorly understood. We have investigated, by comparative sequencing, the evolution of two hotspots of non-allelic homologous recombination on the Y chromosome that lie within paralogous sequences known to sponsor deletions resulting in male infertility.

Results: These recombination hotspots are characterized by signatures of concerted evolution, which indicate that gene conversion between paralogs has been predominant in shaping their recent evolution. By contrast, the paralogous sequences that surround the hotspots exhibit little evidence of gene conversion. A second feature of these rearrangement hotspots is the extreme interspecific sequence divergence (around 2.5%) that places them among the most divergent orthologous sequences between humans and chimpanzees.

Conclusions: Several hominid-specific gene conversion events have rendered these hotspots better substrates for chromosomal rearrangements in humans than in chimpanzees or gorillas. Monte Carlo simulations of sequence evolution suggest that extreme sequence divergence is a direct consequence of gene conversion between paralogs. We propose that the coincidence of signatures of concerted evolution and recurrent breakpoints of chromosomal rearrangement (mapped at the sequence level) may enable the identification of putative rearrangement hotspots from analysis of comparative sequences from great apes."
Recombination has little effect on the rate of sequence divergence in pseudoautosomal boundary 1 among humans and great apes,"['Yi, S', 'Summers, TJ', 'Pearson, NM', 'Li, WH']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.1777204,JAN 2004,22,"Recent studies indicated that recombination is strongly mutagenic. In particular, data from the mouse pseudoautosomal boundary (PAB) suggested that locally intensive recombination increased the nucleotide substitution rate by more than 100-fold and greatly increased the GC content. Here we study the rates of nucleotide substitution in eight introns of the human and great ape XG gene, which spans the boundary between the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) and the X-specific region. Contrary to what is expected under the above hypothesis, our sequence data from humans and great apes reveal that the PAR1 introns of XG have actually evolved slightly slower than X-specific introns. Only when a New World monkey was compared with hominoids were the rates slightly increased in the PAR1 introns. In terms of base composition, although the intergenic regions of the human PAR1 show a significant increase of G and C nucleotides, the base composition of the surveyed PAR1 introns is similar to that of the X-specific introns. Direct and indirect evidence indicates that the recombination rate is, indeed, much higher in PAR1 introns than in X-specific introns, and that the present PAB has persisted since the common ancestor of hominoids. Therefore, the mutagenic effect of recombination is far weaker than previously proposed, at least in hominoid PABs."

After 8 months, we introduced the 4-member focal group to an 8-member gorilla group, thus providing an opportunity to study the effect of the introduction on mother-infant behavior. Overall, time the pair spent physically apart was notably high with contact and proximate scores steadily decreasing over time. The infant was largely responsible for maintaining social proximity, rarely leaving the mother and frequently approaching her. In contrast, the mother left the infant frequently and approached the infant minimally. Maternal affiliative and nonaffiliative behaviors fluctuated throughout the study. Over time, both decreased. Despite a precarious maternal relationship, infant developmental trends were typical for captive gorillas. The results of this study suggest that allowing flexibility in judging maternal conduct can be of benefit to successful gorilla husbandry."

Two young animals, a gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes vellerosus), exhibited a pattern of complete HTLV-1 seroreactivity. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses using the complete LTR (750 bp) and a 522 bp fragment of the env gene indicated the existence of two novel STLV-1 strains, both of which belonged to HTLV-1/STLV-1 molecular clade subtype B, specific to central Africa. These first STLV-1 strains to be characterized in gorilla and chimpanzee were closely related to each other as well as to several HTLV-1 strains originating from inhabitants of south Cameroon, including pygmies. Such findings reinforce the hypothesis of interspecies; transmission of STLV-1 to humans, leading to the present day distribution of HTLV-1 in central African inhabitants."
Domain shuffling has been the main mechanism forming new hominoid killer cell Ig-like receptors,"['Rajalingam, R', 'Parham, P', 'Abi-Rached, L']",JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY,NA,JAN 1 2004,85,"The killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) gene family encodes MHC class I-specific receptors, which regulate NK cell responses and are also expressed on subpopulations of T cells. KIR haplotypes vary in gene content, which, in combination with allelic polymorphism, extensively diversifies the KIR genotype both within and between human populations. Species comparison indicates that formation of new KIR genes and loss of old ones are frequent events, so that few genes are conserved even between closely related species. In this regard, the hominoids define a time frame that is particularly informative for understanding the processes of KIR evolution and its potential impact on killer cell biology. KIR cDNA were characterized from PBMC of three gorillas, and genomic DNA were characterized for six additional individuals. Eleven gorilla KIR genes were defined. With attainment of these data, a set of 75 KIR sequences representing five hominoid species was assembled, which also included rhesus monkey, cattle, and rodent KIR. Searching this data set for recombination events, and phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian methods, demonstrated that new KIR were usually the result of recombination between loci in which complete protein domains were shuffled. Further phylogenetic analysis of the KIR sequences after removal of confounding recombined segments showed that only two KIR genes, KIR2DL4 and KIR2DL5, have been preserved throughout hominoid evolution, and one of them, KIR2DL4, is also common to rhesus monkey and hominoids. Other KIR genes represent recombinant forms present in a minority of species, often only one, as exemplified by 8 of the 11 gorilla KIR genes."
Genetic variability and evolution of two pharmacologically important classes of genes,"['Pungliya, MS', 'Salisbury, BA', 'Nandabalan, K', 'Stephens, JC']",PHARMACOGENOMICS,10.1517/phgs.5.1.115.25684,JAN 2004,5,"We have studied the human genetic variability of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in two pharmaceutically important classes of genes that might be expected to experience different evolutionary pressures: antigen presentation and processing (APP) and nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) genes. We compared the variation pattern in these two classes of genes with 5119 reference (REF) genes. We assessed this variability by sequencing and discovering SNPs in 5'-upstream, 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR), exon, intron, 3'UTR and 3'-downstream regions of all these genes in 79 unrelated humans from diverse ethnic backgrounds, one chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and a gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). SNP density and nucleotide diversity were higher in the APP genes than the REF genes. Relative to the REF genes, APP SNP density was significantly higher in the coding and 3'UTR regions. Higher variation in the coding region of the APP genes was due specifically to having more non-synonymous changes, which suggests that natural selection may be acting to promote change or diversity in these proteins. In contrast, the NHR genes showed lower SNP density and diversity relative to REF genes. The NHR genes consistently showed lower nucleotide diversity in ail the genomic regions except in the 3'-downstream region. SNP frequency data on the non-synonymous SNPs also suggested that the coding region in the NHR genes is conserved to a higher degree than the coding region in the REF genes. Significantly lower SNP density was observed in the 5'-upstream and 5'UTR regions of the NHR genes, perhaps reflecting selective conservation of these regions. Heterozygosity in the APP genes was significantly higher than in the NHR genes in each of the three species tested. Moreover, between species there were more fixed differences in the APP genes than in the NHR genes. Substantial variability exists in these two classes of genes. It is important to consider this interindividual variability pattern while developing drugs that act on such targets."
Survey of gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in Southwestern Cameroon,"['Matthews, A', 'Matthews, A']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-003-0058-4,JAN 2004,32,"A study on the distribution and population density of the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla g. gorilla) and the central chimpanzee (Pan t. troglodytes) was undertaken between December 1997 and August 2000 in the Campo and Ma'an Forests in southwestern Cameroon. The aim of this survey was to estimate the densities of the apes in different parts of the area, to assess the importance of the region for the conservation of these endangered species and to determine the influence of human activities such as logging and hunting. The survey was based on night nest counts on a total of 665.5 km of line transects. The overall density in the Campo Forest was estimated at 0.2 gorillas/km(2) and at 0.63-0.78 chimpanzees/km(2). The overall density of chimpanzees in the Ma'an Forest was estimated at 0.8-1 individuals/km(2). Gorilla density in this area was too low to allow an estimation. The highest gorilla nest density was found in secondary forest. The gorilla density in unlogged forest was significantly lower. Chimpanzees showed a clear preference for less disturbed areas. In unlogged forest, old secondary forests (logging more than 23 years ago) and areas of recent logging with large remaining patches of primary forest, significantly higher densities were calculated than inside the more heavily exploited logging concession. In areas with both logging and high hunting pressure both species were rare or even absent. The Campo Ma'an area is considered a very important area for the conservation of gorillas and chimpanzees. Conservation measures are urgently required to reduce the impact of logging and hunting. The creation of the Campo Ma'an National Park in January 2000 is an important measure to preserve the unique biodiversity in this so far hardly protected area."

Thus, the mother's activities can be considered scaffolding for her daughter with regard to maternal infant care."

Human cytosolic sulfotransferase database mining: identification of seven novel genes and pseudogenes,"['Freimuth, RR', 'Weipert, M', 'Chute, CG', 'Wieben, ED', 'Weinshilboum, RM']",PHARMACOGENOMICS JOURNAL,10.1038/sj.tpj.6500223,2004,40,"A total of 10 SULT genes are presently known to be expressed in human tissues. We performed a comprehensive genome-wide search for novel SULT genes using two different but complementary approaches, and developed a novel graphical display to aid in the annotation of the hits. Seven novel human SULT genes were identified, five of which were predicted to be pseudogenes, including two processed pseudogenes and three pseudogenes that contained introns. Those five pseudogenes represent the first unambiguous SULT pseudogenes described in any species. Expression-profiling studies were conducted for one novel gene, SULT6B1, and a series of alternatively spliced transcripts were identified in the human testis. SULT6B1 was also present in chimpanzee and gorilla, differing at only seven encoded amino-acid residues among the three species. The results of these database mining studies will aid in studies of the regulation of these SULT genes, provide insights into the evolution of this gene family in humans, and serve as a starting point for comparative genomic studies of SULT genes."

Noting that infants come to exhibit many emotions, he also observed that at first their repertoire of expression is highly restricted. Today, considerable controversy exists regarding the question of whether infants experience and express discrete emotions. According to one position, discrete emotions emerge during infancy along with their prototypic facial expressions. These expressions closely resemble adult emotional expressions and are invariantly concordant with their corresponding emotions. In contrast, we propose that the relation between expression and emotion during infancy is more complex. Some infant emotions and emotional expressions may not be invariantly concordant. Furthermore, infant emotional expressions may be less differentiated than previously proposed. Together with past developmental studies, recent cross-cultural research supports this view and suggests that negative emotional expression in particular is only partly differentiated towards the end of the first year."
Construction of a gorilla fosmid library and its PCR screening system,"['Kim, CG', 'Fujiyama, A', 'Saitou, N']",GENOMICS,10.1016/S0888-7543(03)00174-5,NOV 2003,29,"A gorilla fosmid library of 261,120 independent clones was constructed and characterized. The fosmid vector is similar to the cosmid in average insert size of ca. 40 kb but contains the F factor for replication, and it is more resistant to recombination. This clone library represents about 3.7 times coverage of the gorilla genome. A simple screening system by PCR was established, and we successfully found 9 clones that cover the entire Hox A gene cluster of the gorilla genome.

Rapidly evolving genes in human. I. The glycophorins and their possible role in evading malaria parasites,"['Wang, HY', 'Tang, H', 'Shen, CKJ', 'Wu, CI']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msg185,NOV 2003,56,"In an attempt to identify all fast-evolving genes between human and other primates, we found three glycophorins, GPA, GPB, and GPE, to have the highest rate of nonsynonymous substitutions among the 280 genes surveyed. The K-a/K-s ratios are generally greater than 3 for GPA, GPB, and GPE in human, chimpanzee, and gorilla, indicating positive selection. The uniformly high substitution rate across loci can be explained by the frequent sequence exchanges among genes. GPA is the receptor for the binding ligand EBA-175 of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. The levels of nonsynonymous divergence and polymorphism of EBA-175 are also the highest in the genome of P. falciparum. We hypothesize that GPA has been evolving rapidly to evade malaria parasites. Both the high rate of nonsynonymous substitutions and the frequent interlocus conversions may be means of evasion. The support for the evasion hypothesis is still indirect, but, unlike other hypotheses, it can be tested specifically and systematically."
Functional capabilities of modern and fossil hominid hands: Three-dimensional analysis of trapezia,"['Tocheri, MW', 'Marzke, MW', 'Liu, D', 'Bae, M', 'Jones, GP', 'Williams, RC', 'Razdan, A', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10235,OCT 2003,35,"Three-dimensional (3D) trapezium models from Homo sapiens, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Australopithecus afarensis (A.L.333-80), and Homo habilis (O.H.7-NNQ) were acquired through laser digitizing. Least-square planes were generated for each articular surface, and the angles between the planes were compared. Each extant species displays an overall pattern that distinguishes it from the others. The observed angles in G. gorilla and P. troglodytes are more similar to one other than either is to H. sapiens. Our results, obtained from using new 3D modeling and analytical tools, raise interesting questions about the functional capabilities of the fossil trapezia. Multivariate statistical analyses indicate that A.L.333-80 is morphologically more similar to that of modern humans, whereas the O.H.7 trapezium is more similar to that of the gorilla. Significant differences between A.L.333-80 and the extant species occur, but some similarities to humans suggest the ability to form the distinctively human forceful pad-to-side and three-jaw chuck grips. Some key morphological differences from humans highlighted and quantified by our research suggest limitations in the functional capabilities of the O.H.7 trapezium, particularly in those that facilitate pronation at the base of the second metacarpal. If the O.H.7 trapezium represents part of the hand responsible for manufacturing and using the stone tools found at Olduvai, our results suggest that the hand manipulated the stones in a way for which we have no modern analog. Alternative considerations are that the O.H.7 trapezium is not representative of other trapezia from its species (i.e., N = 1), or that it represents another primate or hominid species.

Proximity patterns of female western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) during the six months after parturition,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Hoff, MP', 'Maple, TL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.10110,OCT 2003,14,"Studies of wild mountain gorillas have demonstrated strong preferences among new mothers for the silverback. Protection against infanticide has been theorized to be the primary cause for this attraction. We examined social partner preferences in captive western lowland mothers during the 6 mo after parturition and found that juveniles and females were the primary members of the new mothers' social network. Mothers spent significantly more time in close proximity with both of these subgroups than with the silverback. Proximity patterns changed over time: new mothers spent more time near females in the month after parturition than in the month prior to parturition, and spatial proximity increased again in months 2-6 postparturition. These findings differ from those reported for wild mountain gorillas, which may reflect the lack of infanticide risk in captivity. Given current hypotheses that infanticide may be a limited in western lowland gorillas, the social partner preferences observed here may be indicative of patterns in wild populations.

Further evidence of gorilla presence included 8 nest groups totaling 38 nests, distinctive feeding signs accompanied by footprints, and a gorilla cranium collected from the nearby village of Iboti. This newly discovered gorilla population is geographically intermediate between the 2 extant populations of western gorillas: Gorilla gorilla gorilla, the most populous gorilla subspecies living in Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Congo-Brazzaville, Central African Republic and Cameroon to the south of the Sanaga River, and G. g. diehli or the Cross River gorilla, a small population of ca. 250 individuals on the Cameroon-Nigeria border. It is not possible to assign the new gorilla population to either subspecies on the basis of measurements of the single male cranium. Genetic analyses of freshly shed hairs, collected from gorilla nests, may help to resolve the taxonomic status of the Ebo gorillas."
"Ebola and the decline of gorilla Gorilla gorilla and chimpanzee Pan troglodytes populations in Minkebe Forest, north-eastern Gabon","['Huijbregts, B', 'De Wachter, P', 'Obiang, LSN', 'Akou, ME']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605303000802,OCT 2003,33,"During 1998-2000 extremely low densities of gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla and chimpanzees Pan troglodytes troglodytes were found in the Minkebe Forest block in north-eastern Gabon. When compared with data collected before 1994, these data suggest a catastrophic decline in ape populations in the area. We believe that this decline was caused by a disease epidemic. The period of decline corresponds with the Ebola outbreaks of 1994 and 1996 that occurred in the human population in the same area. Deaths of gorillas and chimpanzees were associated with both Ebola outbreaks. Data from nearby sites indicate that the epidemic was limited to the Minkebe Forest. Occurrence of such epidemic die-offs should be taken into account in conservation strategies for the long-term survival of ape populations. At the time of writing, an Ebola epidemic among humans in the Zadie Department east of Minkebe Forest has resulted in 53 deaths. In the neighbouring Republic of Congo, authorities have reported 43 deaths and at least 12 other cases of Ebola. These epidemics are believed to be linked to the handling and eating of dead apes."
Intra-specific variation in social organization of gorillas: implications for their social evolution,"['Yamagiwa, J', 'Kahekwa, J', 'Basabose, AK']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-003-0049-5,OCT 2003,33,"We analysed intra-specific variation in the social organization of gorillas and ecological and social factors influencing them, based on recent data on diet, day journey length, home range size, group size and proportion of multi-male groups in three subspecies [western lowland gorillas (WLG); eastern lowland gorillas (ELG); mountain gorillas (MG)]. Median group size was similar across subspecies and across habitats, but the extraordinarily large group including > 30 gorillas was only found in habitat with dense terrestrial herbaceous vegetation. Within-group competition may determine the upper limit of group size in frugivorous WLGs and ELGs in lowland habitats with scarce undergrowth. A frugivorous diet may be a causal factor of subgrouping in multi-male groups of WLGs and ELGs, while a folivorous diet may prevent subgrouping in multi-male groups of MGs. Social factors, rather than ecological factors, may play an important role in the formation of multi-male groups and their cohesiveness in MGs. High gregariousness of female gorillas and their prolonged association with a protector male are explained by their vulnerability to both infanticide (MGs) and predators (ELGs). Comparison of long-term changes in group composition and individual movements between ELGs in Kahuzi and MGs in the Virungas suggest that the occurrence of infanticide may promote kin-male association within a group. Threat of infanticide may stimulate MG females to transfer into multi-male groups to seek reliable protection and maturing MG males to stay in their natal groups after maturity. By contrast, the absence of infanticide may facilitate ELG females to associate with infants and other females at transfer and ELG males to establish large groups in a short period by taking females from their natal groups, by luring females from neighbouring groups, or by takeover of a widow group after the death of its leading male. These conditions may prevent ELG and WLG maturing males from remaining to reproduce in their natal groups and possibly result in a rare occurrence of multi-male groups in their habitats. Similar reproductive features of MG and ELG females suggest both female strategies have been adaptive in their evolutionary history."
A study of host defence peptide beta-defensin 3 in primates,"['Boniotto, M', 'Antcheva, N', 'Zelezetsky, I', 'Tossi, A', 'Palumbo, V', 'Falzacappa, MVV', 'Sgubin, S', 'Braida, L', 'Amoroso, A', 'Crovella, S']",BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL,10.1042/BJ20030528,SEP 14 2003,54,"We have investigated the molecular evolution of the gene coding for beta-defensin 3 (DEFB103) in 17 primate species including humans. Unlike the DEFB4 genes (coding for beta-defensin 2) [Boniotto, Tossi, Del Pero, Sgubin, Antcheva, Santon and Masters (2003) Genes Immun. 4, 251-257], DEFB103 shows a marked degree of conservation in humans, Great Apes and New and Old World monkeys. Only the Hylobates concolor defensin hcBD3 showed an amino acid variation Arg(17)-->Trp(17) that could have a functional implication, as it disrupts an intramolecular salt bridge with Glu(27), which locally decreases the charge and may favour dimerization in the human congener hBD3. This is thought to involve the formation of an intermolecular salt bridge between Glu(28) and Lys(32) on another monomer [Schibli, Hunter, Aseyev, Starner, Wiencek, McCray, Tack and Vogel (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 8279-8289]. To test the role of dimerization in mediating biological activity, we synthesized hBD3, hcBD3 and an artificial peptide in which the Lys(26)-Glu(27)-Glu(28) stretch was replaced by the equivalent Phe-Thr-Lys stretch from human beta-defensin 1 and we characterized their structure and anti-microbial activity. Although the structuring and dimerization of these peptides were found to differ significantly, this did not appear to affect markedly the anti-microbial potency, the broad spectrum of activity or the insensitivity of the anti-microbial action to the salinity of the medium."
Geographic and species association of hepatitis B virus genotypes in non-human primates,"['Starkman, SE', 'MacDonald, DM', 'Lewis, JCM', 'Holmes, EC', 'Simmonds, P']",VIROLOGY,10.1016/S0042-6822(03)00430-6,SEP 15 2003,46,"Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been detected in human populations thoughout the world, as well as in a number of ape species (Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, gibbons [Nomascus and Hylobates species] and Pongo pygmaeus). To investigate the distribution of naturally occurring HBV infection in these species and other African Old World monkey species (Cercopithecidae), we screened 137 plasma samples from mainly wild caught animals by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using several of highly conserved primers from the HB surface (HBs) gene. and for HBs antigen (HBsAg) by ELISA. None of the 93 Cercopithecidae screened (6 species) showed PCR or serology evidence for HBV infection; in contrast 2 from 8 chimpanzees and 5 from 22 gibbons were PCR-positive with each set of primers.

Complete genome sequences from each of the positive apes were obtained and compared with all previously published complete and surface gene sequences. This extended phylogenetic analysis indicated that HBV variants from orangutans were interspersed by with HBV variants from southerly distributed gibbon species (H. agilis and H. moloch) occupying overlapping or adjacent habitat ranges with orangutans, in contrast, HBV variants from gibbon species in mainland Asia were phylogenetically distinct. A geographical rather than (sub)species association of HBV would account for the distribution of HBV variants in different subspecies of chimpanzees in Africa, and explain the inlier position of the previously described lowland gorilla sequence in the chimpanzee clade. These new findings have a number of implication for understanding the origins and epidemiology of HBV infection in non-human primates. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Functional significance of cortical bone distribution in anthropoid mandibles: An in vitro assessment of bone strain under combined loads,"['Daegling, DJ', 'Hotzman, JL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10225,SEP 2003,26,"Local variation in cortical bone thickness in the postcanine mandibular corpus appears to be stereotypical among anthropoids. Specifically, at sections under the molars, lingually situated cortical bone is typically thinner than that along the lateral aspect. This pattern applies despite phylogenetic, dietary, and allometric differences among the anthropoids sampled to date. Demes et al. (Food Acquisition and Processing in Primates [1984] New York: Plenum Press, p. 369-390) employed a theoretical analysis of mastication in Gorilla and Homo to argue that this pattern could be explained with reference to biomechanical stresses. Specifically, they proposed that the combined effects of torsion and direct shear on the working-side corpus create a condition in which net stresses and strains are reduced along the lingual cortical plate. Demonstration of this effect would suggest a functional linkage between localized differences in bone mass and strain gradients in the facial skeleton. We conducted an empirical evaluation of the effects of the combined loads of torsion and direct shear in vitro on a sample of formalin-fixed human mandibles. Rosette strain gages were affixed to the lateral and medial aspects of the corpus in each specimen, and surface strains were recorded separately under controlled torsional and occlusal loads, and under simultaneous application of these loads. The hypothesis that lingual strains are reduced under combined twisting and occlusal loads was generally supported; however, we observed reduction in surface strains at some sites along the lateral aspect of the corpus under these combined loads as well. These unexpected findings are attributable to unanticipated loading conditions imposed by occlusal forces, which result from sources of stress in addition to direct shear. These experiments provide provisional support for the hypothesis that superposed sources of bone strain produce large strain gradients between buccal and lingual aspects of the mandibular corpus, and that local variation in bone mass may be associated with these gradients.

Female dispersal and reproductive success in wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Stokes, EJ', 'Parnell, RJ', 'Olejniczak, C']",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,10.1007/s00265-003-0630-3,SEP 2003,93,"This paper presents data on the dispersal patterns and reproductive success of western lowland gorilla females from a long-term study at Mbeli Bai in the Nouabale-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo. We find that female natal and secondary transfer is common. Female immigration rates are negatively related to group size, and emigration rates are positively related to group size, with the net result that larger groups are losing females and smaller groups are gaining females. Furthermore, females transferring between known groups show a preference for significantly smaller groups. However, there is no effect of group size on female reproductive success. Male protection and male quality are considered important in determining female transfer decisions. The case for infanticide is argued and females exhibit strategies that appear to minimise the probability of infanticide following the death of the silverback. Exclusively single-male groups and group formation through female acquisition by solitary males may bias female transfer to lone silverbacks and small groups. The effects of group size on female dispersal and reproductive success are not wholly consistent with an argument for increased foraging costs, and group size effects are more parsimoniously explained by demographic factors. Male protection from intra-group aggression is the most likely factor underlying grouping patterns across gorilla taxa, but differences in population structure and male reproductive strategies may account for inter-specific variation. We stress the need for intra-specific comparisons and more complete data sets on western lowland gorilla feeding behaviour."

Cercopithecidae), Cebus apella, Ateles belzebuth hybridus, Aotus azarae, Saimiri sciureus and Lagothrix lagothricha (F. Cebidae) are presented in this work. We characterized heterochromatin using: (a) in situ digestion with restriction enzymes AluI, HaeIII, RsaI and Sau3A, and (b) chromosome staining with DA/DAPI on unbanded chromosomes, on C-banded chromosomes and on sequentially G-C-banded chromosomes. The aim of this work was to relate the qualitative characteristics of constitutive heterochromatin observed with the cytogenetic evolutive processes in the primate group. Results obtained show that (1) in the family Cercopithecidae, Papionini species do not present chromosomal rearrangements when their karyotypes are compared and the heterochromatin characteristics are uniform, while Cercopithecini species show a high number of chromosomal reorganizations, but they have the same heterochromatic characteristics; (2) the Platyrrhini species analysed show variability in their karyological and heterochromatic characteristics; (3) the Hominoidea present two different situations: Pan, Gorilla and Homo with few chromosomal reorganizations among their karyotypes but with a high variability in their heterochromatin characteristics, and Hylobates with low heterochromatin variability and a highly derived karyotype. Speciation processes related to chromosome changes and heterochromatin variations in different groups of primates are discussed. (C) 2003 The Linnean Society of London."
Unusual extended fibular origin of the human soleus muscle: Possible morpho-physiologic significance based on comparative anatomy,"['Barberini, F', 'Bucciarelli-Ducci, C', 'Zani, A', 'Cerasoli, D']",CLINICAL ANATOMY,10.1002/ca.10171,SEP 2003,5,"bilateral anomalous extended origin of the soleus muscle was observed in a 73-year-old female cadaver. It arose from the head, neck, and proximal two-thirds of the medial crest of the fibula and ran through the posterior intermuscular septum of the leg, from the lateral border of the fibula. The soleus muscle formed the vault of a muscular tunnel, overcoming the deep flexor muscles of the leg that was about 15 cm in length and directed inferiorly and laterally. The extended fibular origin delimited a blind recess lateral to the muscular tunnel and parallel to the posterior surface of the fibula. This recess measured 6.5 cm in length and extended 3.5 cm above the inferior opening of the muscular tunnel; the superior portion of the flexor hallucis longus was housed within it between the portions of the extended origin from the medial crest of the fibula and posterior intermuscular septum. The neurovascular bundle of the posterior leg coursed in the muscular tunnel. The tibial origin and calcaneal insertion of the soleus muscle were normal. Phylogenetic studies of the muscles of the lower limbs in mammals indicate that the fibular origin of soleus is more constant than the tibial origin and, in primates, the fibular origin is the only one observed in most monkeys. The case reported might be considered a conspicuous enlargement of the fibular origin observed in primates. This large fibular origin of the soleus muscle may prove to be a difficulty during surgery when accessing the proximal two-thirds of the fibula for ligation of the peroneal artery.

The task required that the apes remove food from the inside edges of a symmetrical polyvinyl chloride pipe presented to them in their home cages. The results indicate significant species differences with chimpanzees showing population-level right-handedness and orangutans showing population-level left-handedness. The gorillas showed a nonsignificant trend toward right-handedness. The results are discussed in terms of possible ecological or biomechanical factors that may influence hand preferences in different ape species."
"Evolution of the hominoid semenogelin genes, the major proteins of ejaculated semen","['Jensen-Seaman, MI', 'Li, WH']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-003-2474x,SEP 2003,52,"The hominoid primates (apes and humans) exhibit remarkable diversity in their social and sexual behavioral systems. This is reflected in many ways in their anatomy and physiology. For example, the testes and seminal vesicles are relatively large in species with high sperm competition like the chimpanzee and small in species with low or no sperm competition like the gorilla. Additionally, the chimpanzee is the only hominoid primate known to produce a firm copulatory plug, which presumably functions in sperm competition by blocking insemination of subsequent males. Here we examine the molecular evolution of the semenogelin genes (SEMG1 and SEMG2), which code for the predominant structural proteins in human semen. High molecular weight complexes of these proteins are responsible for the viscous gelatinous consistency of human semen; their rodent homologs are responsible for the formation of a firm copulatory plug. Chimpanzees have an expanded SEMG1 gene caused by duplications of tandem repeats, each encoding 60 amino acids, resulting in a protein nearly twice as long as that of humans. In contrast, at both SEMG1 and SEMG2 we observed several gorilla haplotypes that contain at least one premature stop codon. We suggest that these structural changes in the semenogelin proteins that have arisen since the human-chimpanzee-gorilla split may be responsible for the physiological differences between these species ejaculated semen that correlate with their sociosexual behavior."
A chemical enucleation method for the transfer of mitochondrial DNA to rho degrees cells,"['Bayona-Bafaluy, MP', 'Manfredi, G', 'Moraes, CT']",NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH,10.1093/nar/gng100,AUG 15 2003,25,"The study of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations has, in most cases, relied on the production of transmitochondrial cybrids. Although the procedure to produce such cybrids is well established, it is laborious and cumbersome. Moreover, the mechanical enucleation procedure is inefficient and different techniques have to be used depending on the adherence properties of the cell. To circumvent these difficulties, we developed a chemical enucleation method that can have wide applicability for the production of transmitochondrial cybrids. The method is based on the use of actinomycin D to render the nuclear genome transcription/replication inactive and unable to recover after treatment. Such treated cells are fused to cells devoid of mitochondrial DNA and selected for the presence of a functional oxidative phosphorylation system. Our results showed that 95% of the clones recovered by this procedure are true transmitochondrial cybrids. This method greatly facilitates the production of transmitochondrial cybrids, thereby increasing the number of mtDNA mutations and the recipient cell types that can be studied by this system."

Here we optimize data derived from both to more accurately estimate skeletal size dimorphism. Postcranial ratios derived from A.L. 288-1 enable a significant increase in sample size compared with previous studies. Extensive simulations using modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas confirm that this technique is accurate and that skeletal size dimorphism in A. afarensis was most similar to that of contemporary Homo sapiens. These data eliminate some apparent discrepancies between the canine and skeletal size dimorphism in hominoids, imply that the species was not characterized by substantial sexual bimaturation, and greatly increase the probability that the reproductive strategy of A. afarensis was principally monogamy."
Mitochondrial DNA sequence from an enigmatic gorilla population (Gorilla gorilla uellensis),"['Hofreiter, M', 'Siedel, H', 'Van Neer, W', 'Vigilant, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10186,AUG 2003,17,"Although today gorillas are found in only two widely separate, discontinuous western and eastern African populations, rumors of the existence of an additional gorilla population in central Africa have inspired recent unsuccessful field expeditions in search of the ''mystery ape"" termed Gorilla gorilla uellensis. Such a gorilla population would have considerable conservation and scientific interest, and would presumably have descended from a population of gorillas that was thought to exist until the end of the 19th century on the Uele River in the current-day Democratic Republic of Congo. However, the sole evidence for the existence of these gorillas is three skulls and one mandible brought to the Royal Museum for Central Africa (Tervuren, Belgium) in 1898. We determined a mitochondrial DNA sequence from one of these specimens and compared it to sequences from other gorillas. Contrary to expectations, the sequence obtained did not exhibit the phylogenetic distinctiveness typical of a representative of a peripheral isolated population. Rather, the results suggest a scenario in which the museum specimens did not originally derive from the northern Congo, but were brought from the area of current distribution of western gorillas to that location; the subsequent discovery and collection of the specimens there gave rise to the false inference of a local gorilla population.

A population threshold for functional polymorphisms,"['Wong, GKS', 'Yang, ZY', 'Passey, DA', 'Kibukawa, M', 'Paddock, M', 'Liu, CR', 'Bolund, L', 'Yu, J']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.1324303,AUG 2003,25,"We sequenced 114 genes (for DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and detoxification) in a mixed human population and observed a sudden increase in the number of functional polymorphisms below a minor allele frequency of similar to6%. Functionality is assessed by considering the ratio in the number of nonsynonymous single nucletide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the number of synonymous or intron SNPs. This ratio is steady from below 1% in frequency-that regime traditionally associated with rare Mendelian diseases-all the way up to about 6% ill frequency, after which it falls precipitously. We consider possible explanations for this threshold effect. There are four candidates as follows: (1) deleterious variants that have yet to be purified from the Population, (2) balancing selection, in which a selective advantage accrues to the heterozygotes, (3) population-specific functional polymorphisms, and (4) adaptive variants that are accumulating in the population as a response to the dramatic environmental changes of the last 7,000similar to17,000 years."

This study is a valuable complement to our knowledge on the phylogeny of huminoid chromosomes."
"Behavioral ecology of sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda: Diet","['Stanford, CB', 'Nkurunungi, JB']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1024689008159,AUG 2003,72,"Via a field study of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, we found that their diets are seasonally similar, but diverge during lean seasons. Bwindi chimpanzees fed heavily on fruits of Ficus sp., which were largely ignored by the gorillas. Bwindi gorilla diet was overall more folivorous than chimpanzee diet, but was markedly more frugivorous than that of gorillas in the nearby Virunga Volcanoes. During 4 mo of the year Bwindi gorilla diet included more food species than that of the chimpanzees. Three factors in particular-seasonal consumption of fibrous foods by gorillas, interspecific differences in preferred fruit species, and meat consumption by chimpanzees contributed to dietary divergence between the two species. When feeding on fruits, gorillas ate Myrianthus holstii more frequently than chimpanzees did, while chimpanzees included more figs in their annual diet. Chimpanzee diet included meat of duikers and monkeys; gorilla frequently consumed decaying wood."
"Reduced polymorphism in the chimpanzee semen coagulating protein, semenogelin I","['Kingan, SB', 'Tatar, M', 'Rand, DM']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-002-2463-0,AUG 2003,48,"The semen of many primate species coagulates into a mating plug believed to prevent the sperm of subsequent mating events from accessing the ova. The texture of the coagulum varies among species: from a semisoft mass in humans to a firm plug in chimpanzees. In humans, a component of the coagulum. semenogelin 1, also inhibits sperm motility. We tested the hypothesis that polymorphism and divergence at semenogelin I differ among hominoid species with different mating systems. Sequence data for the semenogelin I locus were obtained from 12 humans, 10 chimpanzees, 7 gorillas, and 1 bonobo. Mitochondrial D-loop data were collected from a subset of individuals to assess levels of variation at an unlinked locus. HKA tests using D-loop sequence data revealed a significant reduction of polymorphism at semenogelin I in chimpanzees, consistent with predictions of a selective sweep at this locus. This result was supported by independent HKA tests using polymorphism data from a putatively neutral locus from the literature. Humans show a similar trend toward reduced polymorphism, although HKA tests were only marginally significant. Gorilla sequence data show evidence of functional loss at the semenogelin I locus, indicated by stop codons within the putative open reading frame as well as high levels of polymorphism. Elevated K-a/K-s, ratios within the Pan-Homo clade suggest a history of positive selection at semenogelin I. Our results suggest that there is a positive relationship between the intensity of sperm competition in a species and the strength of positive Darwinian selection on the seminal protein semenogelin I."
Following the LINEs: An analysis of primate genomic variation at human-specific LINE-1 insertion sites,"['Vincent, BJ', 'Myers, JS', 'Ho, HJ', 'Kilroy, GE', 'Walker, JA', 'Watkins, WS', 'Jorde, LB', 'Batzer, MA']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msg146,AUG 2003,36,"The L1 Ta subfamily of long interspersed elements (LINEs) consists exclusively of human-specific L1 elements. Polymerase chain reaction-based screening in nonhuman primate genomes of the orthologous sites for 249 human L1 Ta. elements resulted in the recovery of various types of sequence variants for approximately 12% of these loci. Sequence analysis was employed to capture the nature of the observed variation and to determine the levels of gene conversion and insertion site homoplasy associated with LINE elements. Half of the orthologous loci differed from the predicted sizes due to localized sequence variants that occurred as a result of common mutational processes in ancestral sequences, often including regions containing simple sequence repeats. Additional sequence variation included genomic deletions that occurred upon L1 insertion, as well as successive mobile element insertions that accumulated within a single locus over evolutionary time. Parallel independent mobile element insertions at orthologous loci in distinct species may introduce homoplasy into retroelement-based phylogenetic and population genetic data. We estimate the overall frequency of parallel independent insertion events at L1 insertion sites in seven different primate species to be very low (0.52%). In addition, no cases of insertion site homoplasy involved the integration of a second L1 element at any of the loci, but rather largely involved secondary insertions of Alu elements. No independent mobile element insertion events were found at orthologous loci in the human and chimpanzee genomes. Therefore, L1 insertion polymorphisms appear to be essentially homoplasy free characters well suited for the study of population genetics and phylogenetic relationships within closely related species."

Phylogenetic classification of the paralogous sequences obtained from the draft of the Human Genome Project are in agreement with results from comparative fluorescence in situ hybridization on metaphase chromosomes from human and great apes. The original copy present in 21q22.1 in human was duplicated in great apes after the divergence of the orang-utan and inserted in a pericentromeric region, most likely the ancestor of HSA2q, then disseminated by transposition of a larger fragment to other pericentromeric locations: HSA18p11, HSA13q11 and HSA21q11.1.

Chromosome 21 is the smallest chromosome in the human genome, and some of its regions have been implicated in mental retardation and other diseases. in this study, we sequenced the coding and regulatory regions of 127 known genes on human chromosome 21 in DNA samples from human and chimpanzees and a part of the corresponding genes from orangutan, gorilla, and macaque. Overall, 3,003 nucleotide differences between human and chimpanzee were identified over approximate to400 kb. The differences in coding, promoter, and exon-intron junction regions were 0.51 +/- 0.02%, 0.88 +/- 0.03%, and 0.85 +/- 0.02%, respectively, much lower than the previously reported 1.23% in genomic regions, which suggests the presence of purifying selection. Significant variation in substitution rate among genes was observed by comparing the divergence between human and chimpanzee. Furthermore, by implementing a bioinformatics-based approach, we showed that the identification of genetic variants specific to the human lineage might lead to an understanding of the mechanisms that are attributable to the phenotypes that unique to humans, by changing the structure and/or dosage of the proteins expressed. A phylogenetic analysis unambiguously confirms the conclusion that chimpanzees were our closest relatives to the exclusion of other primates and the relative divergence of the Homo-Pan and that of (Homo-Pan)Gorilla are 4.93 million years and 7.26 million years, respectively."
"Gestural communication in young gorillas (Gorilla gorilla): Gestural repertoire, learning, and use","['Pika, S', 'Liebal, K', 'Tomasello, M']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.10097,JUL 2003,83,"In the present study we investigated the gestural communication of gorillas (Gorilla gorilla). The subjects were 13 gorillas (1-6 years old) living in two different groups in captivity. Our goal was to compile the gestural repertoire of subadult gorillas, with a special focus on processes of social cognition, including attention to individual and developmental variability, group variability, and flexibility of use. Thirty-three different gestures (six auditory, 11 tactile, and 16 visual gestures) were recorded. We found idiosyncratic gestures, individual differences, and similar degrees of concordance between and within groups, as well as some group-specific gestures. These results provide evidence that ontogenetic ritualization is the main learning process involved, but some form of social learning may also be responsible for the acquisition of special gestures. The present study establishes that gorillas have a multifaceted gestural repertoire, characterized by a great deal of flexibility with accommodations to various communicative circumstances, including the attentional state of the recipient. The possibility of assigning Seyfarth and Cheney's [1997] model for nonhuman primate vocal development to the development of nonhuman primate gestural communication is discussed.

Comparative analysis of gene-expression patterns in human and African great ape cultured fibroblasts,"['Karaman, MW', 'Houck, ML', 'Chemnick, LG', 'Nagpal, S', 'Chawannakul, D', 'Sudano, D', 'Pike, BL', 'Ho, VV', 'Ryder, OA', 'Hacia, JG']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.1289803,JUL 2003,79,"Although much is known about genetic variation in human and African great ape (chimpanzee, bonobo, and gorilla) genomes, substantially less is known about variation in gene-expression profiles within and among these species. This information is necessary for defining transcriptional regulatory networks that contribute to complex phenotypes unique to humans or the African great apes. We took a systematic approach to this problem by investigating gene-expression profiles in well-defined cell populations from humans, bonobos, and gorillas. By comparing these profiles from 18 human and 21 African great ape primary fibroblast cell lines, we found that gene-expression patterns could predict the species, but not the age, of the fibroblast donor. Several differentially expressed genes among human and African great ape fibroblasts involved the extracellular matrix, metabolic pathways, signal transduction, stress responses, as well as inherited overgrowth and neurological disorders. These gene-expression patterns could represent molecular adaptations that influenced the development of species-specific traits in humans and the African great apes."

Only a few areas showed the multiloculated architecture typical of Echinococcus multilocularis. Serum antibodies against E. multilocularis antigen were detected in both animals, and granulomatous and necrotizing hepatitis with severe peritonitis due to E. multilocularis was diagnosed.

Possible polyphyletic origin of major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A (MICA) alleles,"['Choy, MK', 'Phipps, ME']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-002-2444-8,JUL 2003,4,"Phylogenetic relationships among 23 nonhuman primate (NHP) major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene (MIC) sequences, 54 confirmed human MICA alleles, and 16 human MICE alleles were constructed with methods of sequence analysis. Topology of the phylogenetic tree showed separation between NHP MICs and human MICs. For human MICs, the topology indicated monophyly for the MICB alleles, while MICA alleles were separated into two lineages, LI and LII. Of these, LI MICA alleles shared a common ancestry with gorilla (Ggo) MIC. One conservative amino acid difference and two nonconservative amino acid differences in the alpha3 domain were found between the MICA lineages. The nonconservative amino acid differences might imply structural and functional differences. Transmembrane (TM) trinucleotide-repeat variants were found to be specific to the MICA lineages such as A4, A9, and A10 to LI and A5 to LII. Variants such as A5.1 and A6 were commonly found in both MICA lineages. Based on these analyses, we postulate a polyphyletic origin for MICA alleles and their division into two lineages, LI and LII. As such, there would be 30 alleles in LI and 24 alleles in LII, thereby reducing the current level of polymorphism that exists, based on a presumed monophyletic origin. The lower degree of polymorphism in MICA would then be in line with the rest of the human major histocompatibility complex nonclassical class I genes."
Abundant gene conversion between arms of palindromes in human and ape Y chromosomes,"['Rozen, S', 'Skaletsky, H', 'Marszalek, JD', 'Minx, PJ', 'Cordum, HS', 'Waterston, RH', 'Wilson, RK', 'Page, DC']",NATURE,10.1038/nature01723,JUN 19 2003,293,"Eight palindromes comprise one-quarter of the euchromatic DNA of the male-specific region of the human Y chromosome, the MSY(1). They contain many testis-specific genes and typically exhibit 99.97% intra-palindromic (arm-to-arm) sequence identity(1). This high degree of identity could be interpreted as evidence that the palindromes arose through duplication events that occurred about 100,000 years ago. Using comparative sequencing in great apes, we demonstrate here that at least six of these MSY palindromes predate the divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages, which occurred about 5 million years ago. The arms of these palindromes must have subsequently engaged in gene conversion, driving the paired arms to evolve in concert. Indeed, analysis of MSY palindrome sequence variation in existing human populations provides evidence of recurrent arm-to-arm gene conversion in our species. We conclude that during recent evolution, an average of approximately 600 nucleotides per newborn male have undergone Y-Y gene conversion, which has had an important role in the evolution of multi-copy testis gene families in the MSY."
"Occlusal relief changes with molar wear in Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla
","[""M'Kirera, F"", 'Ungar, PS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.10077,JUN 2003,42,"Most research on primate tooth form-function relationships has focused on unworn teeth. This study presents a morphological comparison of variably worn lower second molars (M(2)s) of lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla; n = 47) and common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes; n = 54) using dental topographic analysis. High-resolution replicas of occlusal surfaces were prepared and scanned in 3D by laser scanning. The resulting elevation data were used to create a geographic information system (GIS) for each tooth. Occlusal relief, defined as the ratio of 3D surface area to 2D planometric area of the occlusal table, was calculated and compared between wear stages, taxa, and sexes. The results failed to show a difference in occlusal relief between males and females of a given taxon, but did evince differences between wear stages and between taxa. A lack of significant interaction between wear stage and taxon factors suggests that differences in occlusal relief between chimpanzees and gorillas are maintained throughout the wear sequence. These results add to a growing body of information on how molar teeth change with wear, and how differences between primate species are maintained at comparable points throughout the wear sequence. Such studies provide new insights into form-function relationships, which will allow us to infer certain aspects of diet in fossils with worn teeth. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Insectivory by Gorilla gorilla gorilla in southeast Cameroon,"['Deblauwe, I', 'Dupain, J', 'Nguenang, GM', 'Werdenich, D', 'Van Elsacker, L']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1023732212408,JUN 2003,14,"Our study extends quantitative analyses of insect-eating by gorillas ( Gorilla gorilla gorilla) to Cameroon. During a 2-mo period (May-June 2001), we recorded and analyzed feeding traces on plants and insects and in gorilla feces. We found 180 feeding traces, 17% of which involved insectivory. Seventy-eight percent of the fecal samples (n = 36) contained insects. Ants were found in 61% of the samples, termites in 39%, while 56% of the samples contained remains of other insects. We added, greater than or equal to14 new species to the known insect diet of western lowland gorillas. Overall, social insects are predominant. The choice of prey by the Ntonga gorillas gives new clues for the existence of cross-cultural differences among gorilla populations. A comparison of the overall frequency of insectivory with those at other sites in Central Africa indicate a possible effect of forest disturbance on the insectivorous behavior of gorillas. The study suggests the existence of temporal variation in ant- and termite-eating by gorillas."
Use of human visual attention cues by olive baboons (Papio anubis) in a competitive task,"['Vick, SJ', 'Anderson, JR']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/0735-7036.117.2.209,JUN 2003,30,"The ability of 4 olive baboons (Papio anubis) to use human gaze cues during a competitive food task was investigated. Three baboons used head orientation as a cue, and 1 individual also used eye direction alone. As the baboons did not receive prior training with gestural cues, their performance suggests that the competitive paradigm may be more appropriate for testing nonhuman primates than the standard object-choice paradigm. However, the baboons were insensitive to whether the experimenter could actually perceive the food item, and therefore the use of visual orientation cues may not be indicative of visual perspective-taking abilities. Performance was disrupted by the introduction of a screen and objects to conceal food items and by the absence of movement in cues presented."
Patterns of mandibular variation in Pan and Gorilla and implications for African ape taxonomy,"['Taylor, AB', 'Groves, CP']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/S0047-2484(03)00027-7,MAY 2003,29,"Pan and Gorilla taxonomy is currently in a state of flux, with the number of existing species and subspecies of common chimpanzee and gorilla having been recently challenged. While Pan and Gorilla systematics have been evaluated on the basis of craniometric and odontometric data, only a handful of studies have evaluated multivariate craniometric variation within P. troglodytes, and none have evaluated in detail mandibular variation in either P. troglodytes or Gorilla gorilla. In this paper, we examine ontogenetic and adult mandibular variation in Pan and Gorilla. We test the hypothesis that patterns and degrees of mandibular variation in Pan and Gorilla closely correspond to those derived from previous analyses of craniometric variation. We then use these data to address some current issues surrounding Pan and Gorilla taxonomy. Specifically, we evaluate the purported distinctiveness of P.t. verus from the other two subspecies of Pan troglodytes, and the recent proposals to recognize Nigerian gorillas as a distinct subspecies, Gorilla gorilla diehli, and to acknowledge mountain and lowland gorillas as two separate species. Overall, patterns and degrees of multivariate mandibular differentiation parallel those obtained previously for the cranium and dentition. Thus, differences among the three conventionally recognized gorilla subspecies are somewhat greater than among subspecies of common chimpanzees, but differences between P. paniscus and P. troglodytes are greater than those observed between any gorilla subspecies. In this regard, the mandible does not appear to be more variable, or of less taxonomic value, than the face and other parts of the cranium. There are, however, some finer differences in the pattern and degree of morphological differentiation in Pan and Gorilla, both with respect to cranial and dental morphology, and in terms of the application and manner of size adjustment. Mandibular differentiation supports the conventional separation of bonobos from chimpanzees regardless of size adjustment, but size correction alters the relative alignment of taxa. Following size correction, intergroup distances are greatest between P.t. verus and all other groups, but there is considerable overlap amongst chimpanzee subspecies. Amongst gorillas, the greatest separation is between eastern and western gorillas, but adjustment relative to palatal vs. basicranial length results in a greater accuracy of group classification for G.g. gorilla and G.g. graueri, and more equivalent intergroup distances amongst all gorilla groups. We find no multivariate differentiation of the Nigerian gorillas based on mandibular morphology, suggesting that the primary difference between Nigerian and other western lowland gorillas lies in the nuchal region. Though intergroup distances are greatest between P.t. verus and other chimpanzee subspecies, the degree of overlap amongst all three groups does not indicate a markedly greater degree of distinction in mandibular, as opposed to other morphologies. Finally, mandibular differentiation corroborates previous craniodental studies indicating the greatest distinction amongst gorillas is between eastern and western groups. Thus, patterns and degrees of mandibular variation are in agreement with other kinds of data that have been used to diagnose eastern and western gorillas as separate species, (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Animal self-medication and ethno-medicine: exploration and exploitation of the medicinal properties of plants,"['Huffman, MA']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NUTRITION SOCIETY,10.1079/PNS2003257,MAY 2003,105,"Early in the co-evolution of plant-animal relationships, some arthropod species began to utilize the chemical defences of plants to protect themselves from their own predators and parasites. It is likely, therefore, that the origins of herbal medicine have their roots deep within the animal kingdom. From prehistoric times man has looked to wild and domestic animals for sources of herbal remedies. Both folklore and living examples provide accounts of how medicinal plants were obtained by observing the behaviour of animals. Animals too learn about the details of self-medication by watching each other. To date, perhaps the most striking scientific studies of animal self-medication have been made on the African great apes. The great ape diet is often rich in plants containing secondary compounds of non-nutritional, sometimes toxic, value that suggest medicinal benefit from their ingestion. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) are known to swallow whole and defecate intact leaves. The habit has been shown to be a physical means of purging intestinal parasites. Chimpanzees and man co-existing in sub-Saharan Africa are also known to ingest the bitter pith of Vernonia amygdalina for the control of intestinal nematode infections. Phytochemical studies have demonstrated a wide array of biologically-active properties in this medicinal plant species. In light of the growing resistance of parasites and pathogens to synthetic drugs, the study of animal self-medication and ethno-medicine offers a novel line of investigation to provide ecologically-sound methods for the treatment of parasites using plant-based medicines in populations and their livestock living in the tropics."

Here we present survey results conservatively indicating that ape populations in Gabon declined by more than half between 1983 and 2000. The primary cause of the decline in ape numbers during this period was commercial hunting, facilitated by the rapid expansion of mechanized logging. Furthermore, Ebola haemorrhagic fever is currently spreading through ape populations in Gabon and Congo and now rivals hunting as a threat to apes. Gorillas and common chimpanzees should be elevated immediately to 'critically endangered' status. Without aggressive investments in law enforcement, protected area management and Ebola prevention, the next decade will see our closest relatives pushed to the brink of extinction."

Functional language dominance has been related to anatomical asymmetry of Broca's area and the planum temporale. The evolutionary history of these asymmetric patterns, however, remains obscure. Although testing of hypotheses about the evolution of language areas requires comparison to homologous regions in the brains of our closest living relatives, the great apes, to date little is known about normal interindividual variation of these regions in this group. Here we focus on Brodmann's area 44 in African great apes (Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla). This area corresponds to the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and has been shown to exhibit both gross and cytoarchitectural asymmetries in humans. We calculated frequencies of sulcal variations and mapped the distribution of cytoarchitectural area 44 to determine whether its boundaries occurred at consistent macrostructural landmarks. A considerable amount of variation was found in the distribution of the inferior frontal sulci among great ape brains. The inferior precentral sulcus in particular was often bifurcated, which made it impossible to determine the posterior boundary of the pars opercularis. In addition, the distribution of Brodmann's area 44 showed very little correspondence to surface anatomy. We conclude that gross morphologic patterns do not offer substantive landmarks for the measurement of Brodmann's area 44 in great apes. Whether or not Broca's area homologue of great apes exhibits humanlike asymmetry can only be resolved through further analyses of microstructural components. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Furthermore, the data were compared to those levels in the human and long-tailed macaque. The results showed a typical preovulatory E1C surge and postovulatory increase in PdG in all species. The pattern of E1C during the menstrual cycle in the great apes more closely resembled the human than do the long-tailed macaque. A major difference of E1C pattern between these species appeared in the luteal phase. In the great apes and the human, E1C exhibited two peaks, the first peak detected at approximately mid cycle and the second peak detected during the luteal phase. On the other hand, in the long-tailed macaque, increase of E1C in the luteal phase was small or nonexistent. The gorilla, chimpanzee, and bonobo exhibited similar PdG trends. The orangutan excreted one tenth less PdG than these species during the lineal phase. The long-tailed macaque also excreted low levels of PdG. The patterns of FSH in orangutan, chimpanzee, bonobo and long-tailed macaque showed a marked mid-cycle rise and an early follicular phase rise, similar to those in the human. Comparing similar taxa, a large difference was found in FSH of gorilla; there were three peaks during the menstrual cycle. Thus, there is considerable species variation in the excretion of these hormones during the menstrual cycle and comparative studies could be approached with a single method. The methods and baseline data presented here provide the basis for a practical approach to evaluation and monitoring of ovarian events in the female great apes."
A solution to the worn tooth conundrum in primate functional anatomy,"['Ungar, PS', ""M'Kirera, F""]",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0637016100,APR 1 2003,71,"Worn teeth are a bane to paleobiologists interested in the diets of human ancestors and other fossil primates. Although worn teeth dominate fossil assemblages, their shapes are usually not used to reconstruct the diets of extinct species. The problem is that traditional studies of primate dental functional anatomy have focused on unworn morphology. This has limited most functional analyses to only a few well-represented fossil species. This paper introduces a method to characterize and compare worn occlusal morphology in primates using laser scanning and geographic information systems technologies. A study of variably worn chimpanzee and gorilla molars indicates that differences between these species in tooth shape remain consistent at given stages of wear. Although cusp slope decreases with wear in both taxa, angularity values remain unchanged. These results indicate that African ape teeth wear in a manner that keeps them mechanically efficient for fracturing specific foods. Studies of changes in tooth shape with wear add a new dimension to dental functional anatomy, and offer a more complete picture of dental-dietary adaptations. Also, given how rare unworn teeth are in the fossil record, the ability to include worn specimens in analyses opens the door to reconstructing the diets of many more extinct primate groups, allowing us to better understand the adaptive radiation of our order."

Imitation as behaviour parsing,"['Byrne, RW']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2002.1219,MAR 29 2003,95,"Non-human great apes appear to be able to acquire elaborate skills partly by imitation, raising the possibility of the transfer of skill by imitation in animals that have only rudimentary mentalizing capacities: in contrast to the frequent assumption that imitation depends on prior understanding of others' intentions. Attempts to understand the apes' behaviour have led to the development of a purely mechanistic model of imitation, the 'behaviour parsing' model, in which the statistical regularities that are inevitable in planned behaviour are used to decipher the organization of another agent's behaviour, and thence to imitate parts of it. Behaviour can thereby be understood statistically in terms of its correlations (circumstances of use, effects on the environment) without understanding of intentions or the everyday physics of cause-and-effect. Thus, imitation of complex, novel behaviour may not require mentalizing, but conversely behaviour parsing may be a necessary preliminary to attributing intention and cause."

In humans, >60% of these are pseudogenes. In contrast, the mouse OR repertoire, although of roughly equal size, contains only approximate to20% pseudogenes. We asked whether the high fraction of nonfunctional OR genes is specific to humans or is a common feature of all primates. To this end, we have compared the sequences of 50 human OR coding regions, regardless of their functional annotations, to those of their putative orthologs in chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and rhesus macaques. We found that humans have accumulated mutations that disrupt OR coding regions roughly 4-fold faster than any other species sampled. As a consequence, the fraction of OR pseudogenes in humans is almost twice as high as in the non-human primates, suggesting a human-specific process of OR gene disruption, likely due to a reduced chemosensory dependence relative to apes."

Large-scale variation among human and great ape genomes determined by array comparative genomic hybridization,"['Locke, DP', 'Segraves, R', 'Carbone, L', 'Archidiacono, N', 'Albertson, DG', 'Pinkel, D', 'Eichler, EE']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.1003303,MAR 2003,93,"Large-scale genomic rearrangements are a major force Of evolutionary change and the ascertainment of such events between the human and great ape genomes is fundamental to a complete understanding of the genetic history and evolution of our species. Here, we present the results of an evolutionary analysis utilizing array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), measuring copy-number gains and losses among these species. Using an array of 2460 human bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) (12% of the genome), we identified a total of 63 sites of putative DNA copy-number variation between humans and the great apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and orangutan). Detailed molecular characterization of a subset of these sites confirmed rearrangements ranging from 40 to at least 175 kb in size. Surprisingly, the majority of variant sites differentiating great ape and human genomes were found within interstitial euchromatin. These data suggest that such large-scale events are not restricted solely to subtelomeric or pericentromeric regions, but also occur within genic regions. In addition, 519 of the verified variant sites localized to areas of intrachromosomal segmental duplication within the human genome. On the basis of the frequency of duplication in humans, this represents a 14-fold positional bias. In contrast to previous cytogenetic and comparative mapping studies, these results indicate extensive local repatterning of hominoid chromosomes in euchromatic regions through a duplication-driven mechanism of genome evolution."
Segmental duplications in euchromatic regions of human chromosome 5: A source of evolutionary instability and transcriptional innovation,"['Courseaux, A', 'Richard, F', 'Grosgeorge, J', 'Ortola, C', 'Viale, A', 'Turc-Carel, C', 'Dutrillaux, B', 'Gaudray, P', 'Nahon, JL']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.490303,MAR 2003,33,"Recent analyses of the structure of pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions have revealed that these particular regions of human chromosomes are often composed of blocks of duplicated genomic segments that have been associated with rapid evolutionary turnover among the genomes of closely related primates. In the present study, we show that euchromatic regions of human chromosome 5-5p14, 5p13, 5q13, 5q15-5q21-also display such an accumulation of segmental duplications. The structure, organization and evolution of those primate-specific sequences were Studied in detail by combining in silica and comparative FISH analyses on human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutang, macaca, and capuchin chromosomes. Our results lend support to a two-step model of transposition duplication in the euchromatic regions, with a founder insertional event at the time of divergence between Platyrrhini and Catarrhini (25-35 million years ago) and an apparent burst of inter-and intrachromosomal duplications in the Hominidae lineage. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis suggests that the chronology and, likely, molecular mechanisms, differ regarding the region of primary insertion-euchromatic versus pericentromeric regions. Lastly, we show that as their counterparts located near the heterochromatic region, the euchromatic segmental duplications have consistently reshaped their region of insertion during primate evolution, creating putative mosaic genes, and they are obvious candidates for causing ectopic rearrangements that have contributed to evolutionary/genomic instability."
Molecular phylogeny and evolution of the human endogenous retrovirus HERV-W LTR family in hominoid primates,"['Huh, JW', 'Hong, KW', 'Yi, JM', 'Kim, TH', 'Takenaka, O', 'Lee, WH', 'Kim, HS']",MOLECULES AND CELLS,NA,FEB 28 2003,6,"Long terminal repeats (LTRs) of human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) have contributed to the structural change or genetic variation of primate genome that are connected to speciation and evolution. Using genomic DNAs that were derived from hominoid primates (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon), we performed PCR amplification and identified thirty HERV-W LTR elements. These LTR elements showed a 82-98% sequence similarity with HERV-W LTR (AF072500). Specifically, additional sequences (GCCACCACCACTGTTT in the gorilla and TGCTGCT-GACTCCCATCC in the gibbon) were noticed. Clone OR3 from the orangutan and clone G12 from the gibbon showed a 100% sequence similarity, although they are different species. This indicates that both LTR elements were proliferated during the last 2 to 5 million years from the integration of the original LTR element. A phylogenetic tree that was obtained by the neighbor-joining method revealed a wide overlap of the LTR elements across species, suggesting that the HERV-W LTR family evolved independently during the hominoid evolution."

All microscopically positive samples were confirmed by PCR using primers designed to amplify DNA fragments from two independent loci, i.e. the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene and the small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) gene. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length ssrRNA gene placed this isolate within a clade that contains all currently known C parvum species/genotypes, closely related to the C parvum pig genotype. Comparison with partial ssrRNA sequences available in the GenBank(TM) revealed 100% sequence identity with the genotype previously identified in Canadian patients. This finding was confirmed further by comparison of the COWP gene partial sequences. Published by Elsevier Science B.V."

We observed nest building in 17 gorillas during three periods: summer baseline, winter baseline, and winter treatment, in which the amount of available nesting material was doubled. We conducted observations exclusively in the indoor holding area in the hour following evening departure of animal care staff. During baseline, gorillas engaged in nest-building on 3.1% of scans and were on a constructed nest on 27.9% of scans Overall, gorillas spent significantly more time on elevated nests than on floor nests There were no statistically significant sex, age class, or rearing history differences in nest building, time spent on a nest, or nest location preference. Nest building consisted of both gathering and manipulating materials The gorillas spent significantly more time building nests in winter than in summer. Additionally, they were more often on elevated nests during winter than summer. Doubling the amount of nesting material did not increase nest building, but it increased the number of floor nests Our results suggest that providing adequate materials to captive gorillas for nest building may facilitate performance of species-typical nest-building, minimize competition among individuals for nesting sites and materials, and permit individual thermoregulation."

Due to the close taxonomic relationship between humans and gorillas there is potential for disease transmission between them. Preventing the introduction or spread of transmissible diseases to the gorillas is essential to protect them. We interviewed 301 villagers living in close proximity to BIFNP with a medical questionnaire in July, 2000. We collected information on demographics, vaccination and health history, and human/gorilla interaction. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of several diseases in the human population and to evaluate the risk of anthropozoonotic transmission from humans to gorillas We found a high prevalence of disease symptoms such as coughing (72.1%) and fever (56.1%) compatible with acute infectious diseases; over half of the respondents (59.1%) had a specific disease diagnosis within the 6 mo preceding the study. We compared villagers who had visual contact with gorillas in the 6 mo preceding the study (53.5%) to villagers who had no visual contact (46.5%). Men were 2.3 times more likely than women to have visual contact with gorillas In general, the frequency of disease history and symptoms was similar for people with and without contact. The high prevalence of acute infectious diseases in the population surrounding BIFNP and the high rate of contact with gorillas creates the potential for anthropozoonotic disease transmission."

We undertake a comparative genetic analysis among human populations and primate species in the normal variation range, where forces that shaped present diversity can be recognised. We determinate number of repeats of the short tandem repeat through allele length sizing and sequencing methods. Human allele distributions are very similar among populations, ruling out ethnicity as a genetic risk for allele expansion. Primate comparison shows human-specific features, with longer human alleles due to a novel variable trinucleotide repeat, not present in non-human primates, which increased the disease-causing expansion likelihood. SCA8 seems to be a human specific disease. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

Porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) and xenotransplantation: screening for transmission in several clinical trials and in experimental models using non-human primates.,"['Denner, J']",Annals of transplantation,NA,2003,27,"Xenotransplantation may develop into a medical technology able to save or improve the quality of life. Porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), because they are integrated in the genome of all pig strains, because they are produced by normal pig cells, and because they can infect human cell in vitro, are considered to be the main microbiological risk if pig cells, tissues or organs are to be transplanted. Indeed, serial passaging of PERV on human cells, simulating the situation during xenotransplantation, was found to increase the titer of the virus and was associated with corresponding genetic changes in the viral LTR. In vitro infection studies showed a productive infection of primary cells of different species including non-human primates and man. However, using newly developed sensitive detection methods, evidence for PERV transmission was seen neither in over 200 patients who had received porcine xenotransplants nor in butchers frequently exposed to pig tissues. Similarly, rats, guinea pigs, minks, rhesus macaques, pig tailed macaques and baboons inoculated with high doses of PERV and given strong daily immunosuppressive treatment failed to exhibit evidence of infection. These data are crucial for the evaluation of xenotransplantation safety because they demonstrate that PERVs cannot easily be transmitted to other species including man."
Multitude multicolor chromosome banding (mMCB) - a comprehensive one-step multicolor FISH banding method,"['Weise, A', 'Heller, A', 'Starke, H', 'Mrasek, K', 'Kuechler, A', 'Pool-Zobel, BL', 'Claussen, U', 'Liehr, T']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000076286,2003,29,"Multicolor chromosome banding (MCB) using one single chromosome-specific MCB probe set per experiment was previously reported as powerful tool in molecular cytogenetics for the characterization of all kinds of human marker chromosomes. However, a quick analysis of karyotypes with highly complex chromosomal changes was hampered by the problem that up to 24 MCB experiments were necessary for a cornprehensive karyotype description. To overcome that limitation the 138 available region-specific microdissection-derived libraries for all human chromosomes were combined to one single probe set, called multitude MCB (mMCB). A typical fluorescence banding pattern along the human karyotype is produced, which can be evaluated either by transforming these profiles into chromosome region-specific pseudo-colors or more reliably by studying the fluorescence profiles. The mMCB probe set has been applied on chromosomes of normal male and female probands, two primary myelodysplastic syndromes and two solid tumor cell lines. Additionally, a cell line of Gorilla gorilla (GGO) studied previously by single chromosome-specific MCB was reevaluated by the mMCB method. All results were in concordance with those obtained in parallel or by other cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic approaches indicating that mMCB is a powerful multicolor FISH banding tool for fast characterization of complex karyotypes.

Comparative urinary androstanes in the great apes,"['Hagey, LR', 'Czekala, NM']",GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY,10.1016/S0016-6480(02)00569-5,JAN 2003,16,"Urinary androstanes from seven species of male great apes (human, bonobo, chimpanzee, lowland gorilla, mountain gorilla, Bornean orangutan, and Sumatran orangutan) were separated by HPLC and detected by RIA using two testosterone antibodies. All animals examined showed the presence of testosterone and six additional immunoreactive peaks. Although testosterone was the dominant peak (85%) in human urine, its proportion in urine was much less in the other apes, ranging from a high of 59% in the bonobo and chimpanzee to a low of 24% in the mountain gorilla. Urinary androstanes were also directly visualized using nano-spray mass spectrometry (nanoESI-MS). Although the RIA can qualitatively produce a strong signal for testosterone in unchromatographed urine, it is quantitatively present only as a trace metabolite, as demonstrated by nanoESI-MS. The combination of the two techniques showed large differences in androstane metabolism between the seven species. A previously undescribed testosterone metabolite (tentatively identified as either Delta1- or Delta6-testosterone sulfate) was present in significant proportions in all of the non-human apes examined. We conclude that in the great apes, testosterone is only a trace metabolite in urine, and as a consequence, its measurement may not produce results that parallel the levels of serum testosterone. The RIA measurement of urinary testosterone in part records additional androstane metabolites, which vary even between closely related genera, making the results neither equivalent with nor comparable to different species.

Refinement of a chimpanzee pericentric inversion breakpoint to a segmental duplication cluster,"['Locke, DP', 'Archidiacono, N', 'Misceo, D', 'Cardone, MF', 'Deschamps, S', 'Roe, B', 'Rocchi, M', 'Eichler, EE']",GENOME BIOLOGY,10.1186/gb-2003-4-8-r50,2003,66,"Background: Pericentric inversions are the most common euchromatic chromosomal differences among humans and the great apes. The human and chimpanzee karyotype differs by nine such events, in addition to several constitutive heterochromatic increases and one chromosomal fusion event. Reproductive isolation and subsequent speciation are thought to be the potential result of pericentric inversions, as reproductive boundaries form as a result of hybrid sterility.

Results: Here we employed a comparative fluorescence in situ hybridization approach, using probes selected from a combination of physical mapping, genomic sequence, and segmental duplication analyses to narrow the breakpoint interval of a pericentric inversion in chimpanzee involving the orthologous human 15q11-q13 region. We have refined the inversion breakpoint of this chimpanzee-specific rearrangement to a 600 kilobase (kb) interval of the human genome consisting of entirely duplicated material. Detailed analysis of the underlying sequence indicated that this region comprises multiple segmental duplications, including a previously characterized duplication of the alpha7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit gene (CHRNA7) in 15q13.3 and several Golgin-linked-to-PML, or LCR15, duplications.

Conclusions: We conclude that, on the basis of experimental data excluding the CHRNA7 duplicon as the site of inversion, and sequence analysis of regional duplications, the most likely rearrangement site is within a GLP/LCR15 duplicon. This study further exemplifies the genomic plasticity due to the presence of segmental duplications and highlights their importance for a complete understanding of genome evolution."
Early hominin speciation at the Plio/Pleistocene transition,"['Cameron, DW', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1078/0018-442X-00057,2003,5,"Over the last half-decade or so, there has been an explosion in the recognition of hominin genera and species. We now have the late Miocene genera Orrorin and Sahelanthropus, the mid Pliocene genus Kenyanthropus, three new Pliocene species of Australopithecus (A. anamensis, A. garht and A. bahrelg-hazalt) and a sub species of Ardipithecus (Ar. r. kadabba) to contend with. Excepting also the more traditional species allocated to Paranthropus, Australopithecus and early Homo we are approaching around 15 species over 5 million years (excluding hominin evolution over the last one million years). Can such a large number of hominin species be justified? An examination of extant hominid (Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Pan paniscus) anatomical variability indicates that the range of fossil hominin variability supports the recognition of this large number of fossil species. It is also shown that not all hominins are directly related to the emergence of early Homo and as such have become extinct. Indeed the traditional australopithecine species 'A'. anamensis, 'A'. afarensis and W. garhi are considered here to belong to a distinct genus Praeanthropus. They are also argued not be hominins, but rather an as yet undefined hominid group from which the more derived hominins evolved. The first hominin is represented by A. africanus or a hominin very much like it. The Paranthropus clade is defined by a derived heterochronic condition of peramorphosis, associated with sequential progenesis (contraction of successive growth stages) in brain and dental development, but a mixture of peramorphic and paedomorphic features in its craniofacial anatomy. Conversely, Kenyanthropus and Homo both share a pattern of peramorphosis, associated with sequential hypermorphosis (prolongation of successive growth stages) in brain development, and paedo-morphosis processes in cranial, facial and dental development. This suggests, that these two clades share an important synapomorphy not recognised in the parsimony analyses, suggesting that they may form a sister group relationship to the exclusion of Paranthropus. This highlights the need to re-interpret phylo-genetic results in terms of function and development. The rapid speciation and extinction as argued here is in keeping with other fossil groups in Africa at the Plio/Pleistocene transition. This emphasises that we must approach the pre-australopithecines and hominins as part of the endemic African fauna, and not in isolation to the evolutionary and climatic processes that were operating all around them."
Problems with the use of cladistic analysis in palaeoanthropology,"['Curnoe, D']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1078/0018-442X-00048,2003,9,"Cladistic analysis is a popular method for reconstructing evolutionary relationships on the human lineage. However, it has limitations and hidden assumptions that are often not considered by palaeoanthropologists. Some researchers who are opposed to its use regard cladistics as the preferred method for taxonomic ""splitters"" and claim it has lead to a revitalisation Of typology. Typology remains a part of human evolutionary studies, regardless of the acceptance or use of cladistics. The assumption/preference for ""splitting"" over ""lumping"" in cladistics (alpha) taxonomy and the general failure to evaluate (post-hoc) such taxonomies have served to reinforce this assertion.

Researchers have also adopted a number of practices that are logically untenable or introduce considerable error. The evolutionary trend of human encephalisation, apparently isometric with body size, and concurrent reduction in the gut and masticatory apparatus, suggests continuous cladistic characters are biased by problems of body size.

The method suffers a logical weakness, or circularity, leading to bias when characters with multiple states are used. Coding of such characters can only be done using prior criteria, and this is usually done using an existing phylogenetic scheme. Another problem with coding character states is the handling of variation within species. While this form of variation is usually ignored by palaeoanthropologists, when characters are recognised as varying, their treatment as a separate state adds considerable error to cladograms.

The genetic proximity of humans, chimpanzees and gorillas has important implications for cladistic analyses. It is argued that chimpanzees and gorillas should be treated as ingroup taxa and an alternative outgroup such as orangutans should be used, or an (hypothetical) ancestral body plan developed. Making chimpanzees and gorillas ingroup taxa would considerably enhance the biological utility of anthropological cladograms.

All published human cladograms fail to meet standard quality criteria indicating that none of them may be considered reliable. The continuing uncertainty over the number and composition of fossil human species is the largest single source of error for cladistics and human phylogenetic reconstruction."
Three duplicons form a novel chimeric transcription unit in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 22q11,"['Bridgland, L', 'Footz, TK', 'Kardel, MD', 'Riazi, MA', 'McDermid, HE']",HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s00439-002-0827-y,JAN 2003,9,"Pericentromeric regions of human chromosomes are preferential sites for the integration of duplicated DNA, or ""duplicons"", which often contain gene fragments. Although pericentromeric regions appear to be genomic junkyards, they could also be the birthplace of new genes with novel functions. We have characterized a chimeric transcription unit (cat eye syndrome critical region gene 7, CECR7) formed from three duplicons in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 22q. CECR7 exons show similarity to sequences on chromosomes 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, and elsewhere on 22. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of CECR7 duplicon boundaries in various primate species, and the sequence divergence between the human duplicons and their putative ancestral human loci, CECR7 was probably formed before the separation of macaque and is therefore older than most previously reported pericentromeric duplicons. Expression of CECR7 was detected by RT-PCR in humans and gorilla fibroblasts, but not orangutan, suggesting that expression did not result immediately from the formation of this novel transcription unit, or that expression was silenced in orangutan following its formation."

Transmission involved direct contact with an infected person especially within families. Epidemiological data traced introduction of Ebola virus into the population to three primary cases mainly involving hunters. In all three cases development of the disease followed contact with non-human primates (gorillas) and other mammals (antelope) that had either been killed or found dead. Three health care workers were infected during the epidemic but nosocomial transmission played a minor role in the epidemic.

Variation of variable number of tandem repeat sequences in the 3 '-untransiated region of primate dopamine transporter genes that affects reporter gene expression,"['Inoue-Murayama, M', 'Adachi, S', 'Mishima, N', 'Mitani, H', 'Takenaka, O', 'Terao, K', 'Hayasaka, I', 'Ito, S', 'Murayama, Y']",NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS,10.1016/S0304-3940(02)01125-4,DEC 16 2002,42,"Genetic polymorphism has been reported in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the human dopamine transporter (DAT) gene and the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism has been proposed to be associated with normal personal traits or psychoneurological disorders. To assess the variation of this region in nonhuman primates, we amplified the VNTR regions by the polymerase chain reaction in several species of apes and monkeys, and determined their DNA sequences. The 3'-UTR of the chimpanzee DAT gene was also polymorphic and alleles with one or two unit(s) of a 40 bp sequence were found, while all gorillas and orangutans examined had only 2-repeat allele. Cynomolgus macaques and African green monkeys shared 11- or 12-repeat and 5-repeat alleles, respectively. By performing transient transfection assay, we found that most of the VNTR sequences of nonhuman primates exhibited higher activities on reporter gene assay as compared to those of human 9-, 10- and 11-repeat sequences.

Likelihood and Bayes estimation of ancestral population sizes in hominoids using data from multiple loci,"['Yang, ZH']",GENETICS,NA,DEC 2002,89,"Polymorphisms in an ancestral population can cause conflicts between gene trees and the species tree. Such conflicts can be used to estimate ancestral population sizes when data from multiple loci are available. In this article I extend previous work for estimating ancestral population sizes to analyze sequence data from three species under a finite-site nucleotide substitution model. Both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayes methods are implemented for joint estimation of the two speciation dates and the two population size parameters. Both methods account for uncertainties in the gene tree due to few informative sites at each locus and make an efficient use of information in the data. The Bayes algorithm using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) enjoys a computational advantage over ML and also provides a framework for incorporating prior information about the parameters. The methods arc applied to a data set of 53 nuclear noncoding contigs from human, chimpanzee, and gorilla published by Chen and Li. Estimates of the effective population size for the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees by both ML and Bayes methods are similar to12,000-21,000, comparable to estimates for modern humans, and do not support the notion of a dramatic size reduction in early human populations. Estimates published previously from the same data are several times larger and appear to be biased due to methodological deficiency. The divergence between humans and chimpanzees is dated at similar to5.2 million years ago and the gorilla divergence 1.1-1.7 million years earlier. The analysis suggests that typical data sets contain useful information about the ancestral population sizes and that it is advantageous to analyze data of several species simultaneously."
"Evidence for a fast, intrachromosomal conversion mechanism from mapping of nucleotide variants within a homogeneous alpha-satellite DNA array","['Schindelhauer, D', 'Schwarz, T']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.451502,DEC 2002,38,"Assuming that patterns of sequence variants within highly homogeneous centromeric tandem repeat arrays can tell us which molecular turnover mechanisms are presently at work, we analyzed the a-satellite tandem repeat array DXZI of one human X chromosome. Here we present accurate snapshots from this dark matter of the genome. We demonstrate stable and representative cloning of the array in a P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) library, use samples of higher-order repeats subcloned from five unmapped PACs (120-160 kb) to identify common variants, and show that such variants are presently in a fixed transition state. To characterize patterns of variant spread throughout homogeneous array segments, we use a novel partial restriction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis mapping approach. We find an older large-scale (35-50 kb) duplication event supporting the evolutionarily important unequal crossing-over hypothesis, but generally find independent variant occurrence and a paucity of potential de novo mutations within segments of highest homogeneity (99.1%-99.3%). Within such segments, a highly nonrandom variant clustering within adjacent higher-order repeats was found in the absence of haplotypic repeats. Such variant clusters are hardly explained by interchromosomal, fixation-driving mechanisms and likely reflect a fast, localized, intrachromosomal sequence conversion mechanism."
Quantifying temporal bone morphology of great apes and humans: an approach using geometric morphometrics,"['Lockwood, CA', 'Lynch, JM', 'Kimbel, WH', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFRICANUS']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00122.x,DEC 2002,58,"The hominid temporal bone offers a complex array of morphology that is linked to several different functional systems. Its frequent preservation in the fossil record gives the temporal bone added significance in the study of human evolution, but its morphology has proven difficult to quantify. In this study we use techniques of 3D geometric morphometrics to quantify differences among humans and great apes and discuss the results in a phylogenetic context. Twenty-three landmarks on the ectocranial surface of the temporal bone provide a high level of anatomical detail. Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) is used to register (adjust for position, orientation and scale) landmark data from 405 adults representing Homo, Pan, Gorilla and Pongo. Principal components analysis of residuals from the GPA shows that the major source of variation is between humans and apes. Human characteristics such as a coronally orientated petrous axis, a deep mandibular fossa, a projecting mastoid process, and reduced lateral extension of the tympanic element strongly impact the analysis. In phenetic cluster analyses, gorillas and orangutans group together with respect to chimpanzees, and all apes group together with respect to humans. Thus, the analysis contradicts depictions of African apes as a single morphotype. Gorillas and orangutans lack the extensive preglenoid surface of chimpanzees, and their mastoid processes are less medially inflected. These and other characters shared by gorillas and orangutans are probably primitive for the African hominid clade."
Classification trees as an alternative to linear discriminant analysis,"['Feldesman, MR']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10102,NOV 2002,41,"Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is frequently used for classification/prediction problems in physical anthropology, but it is unusual to find examples where researchers consider the statistical limitations and assumptions required for this technique. In these instances, it is difficult to know whether the predictions are reliable. This paper considers a nonparametric alternative to predictive LDA: binary, recursive (or classification) trees. This approach has the advantage that data transformation is unnecessary, cases with missing predictor variables do not require special treatment, prediction success is not dependent on data meeting normality conditions or covariance homogeneity, and variable selection is intrinsic to the methodology. Here I compare the efficacy of classification trees with LDA, using typical morphometric data. With data from modem hominoids, the results show that both techniques perform nearly equally. With complete data sets, LDA may be a better choice, as is shown in this example, but with missing observations, classification trees perform outstandingly well, whereas commercial discriminant analysis programs do not predict classifications for cases with incompletely measured predictor variables and generally are not designed to address the problem of missing data. Testing of data prior to analysis is necessary, and classification trees are recommended either as a replacement for LDA or as a supplement whenever data do not meet relevant assumptions. It is highly recommended as an alternative to LDA whenever the data set contains important cases with missing predictor variables. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
"Western lowland gorilla diet and resource availability: New evidence, cross-site comparisons, and reflections on indirect sampling methods","['Doran, DM', 'McNeilage, A', 'Greer, D', 'Bocian, C', 'Mehlman, P', 'Shah, N']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.10053,NOV 2002,100,"We describe the resource availability and diet of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from a new study site in the Central African Republic and Republic of Congo based on 3 years of study. The results, based on 715 fecal samples and 617 days of feeding trails, were similar to those reported from three other sites, in spite of differences in herb and fruit availability. Staple foods (consumed year-round) included high-quality herbs (Haumania), swamp herbs (when present), and a minimal diversity of fruit. A variety of fruits (average of 3.5 species per day and 10 per month) were selectively consumed; gorillas ignored some common fruits and incorporated rare fruits to a degree higher than predicted based on availability. During periods of fruit abundance, fruit constituted most of the diet. When succulent fruits were unavailable, gorillas used low-quality herbs (i.e., low-protein), bark, and more fibrous fruits as fallback foods. Fibrous fruit species, such as Duboscia macrocarpa and Klainedoxa gabonensis, were particularly important to gorillas at Mondika and other sites as fallbacks. The densities of these two species are similar across sites for which data are available, in spite of major differences in forest structure, suggesting they may be key species in determining gorilla density. No sex difference in diet was detected. Such little variation in western lowland gorilla diet across sites and between sexes was unexpected and may partly reflect limitations of indirect sampling.

Pan-African Sanctuary Alliance: Status and range of activities for great ape conservation,"['Farmer, KH']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.10054,NOV 2002,21,"While wild populations continue to decrease, the number of orphaned primates, sanctuaries, and attempts to reintroduce primates back to the natural environment are increasing. An umbrella organization called the Pan-African Sanctuary Alliance (PASA) was formed in 2000 and recently the IUCN Reintroduction Specialist Group developed a set of specific policy guidelines for primates (2002). Data presented in this report are based upon questionnaire responses by managers from 17 African facilities that have become members of PASA (membership in PASA is defined by attendance at an annual PASA workshop). These PASA facilities house over 500 great apes. (There may be other facilities not represented here simply because their managers did not attend a PASA workshop.) The majority of the apes arrived at the sanctuaries when they were less than 4 years old and half were confiscated. Over 40% were found awaiting sale, and 30% had been previously kept as pets. Common ailments upon arrival included internal parasites, behavioral abnormalities, and malnutrition; 20% of the total sanctuary population died prematurely. Most sanctuaries use a combination of enclosures surrounded by electric fencing and cages to accommodate the apes. Sanctuaries actively participate in conservation education, habitat protection, tourism, scientific data collection, local development, and reintroduction. The median total facility operating cost was US$65,000 per annum. The median facility cost per ape was US$2,222 per annum. Most funding comes from overseas nongovernmental agencies. Discussion focuses on evaluating the present status of sanctuaries, the problems facing them, and their potential role in African conservation issues. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Genomic structure and evolution of the ancestral chromosome fusion site in 2ql3-2ql4.1 and paralogous regions on other human chromosomes,"['Fan, Y', 'Linardopoulou, E', 'Friedman, C', 'Williams, E', 'Trask, BJ']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.337602,NOV 2002,70,"Human chromosome 2 was formed by the head-to-head fusion of two ancestral chromosomes that remained separate in other primates. Sequences that once resided near the ends of the ancestral chromosomes are now interstitially located in 2ql3-2ql4.1. Portions of these sequences had duplicated to other locations prior to the fusion. Here we present analyses of the genomic structure and evolutionary history of >600 kb surrounding the fusion site and closely related sequences on other human chromosomes. Sequence blocks that closely flank the inverted arrays of degenerate telomere repeats marking the fusion site are duplicated at many, primarily subtelomeric, locations. In addition, large portions of a 168-kb centromere-proximal block are duplicated at 9pter, 9pll.2, and 9ql3, with 98%-99% average sequence identity. A 67-kb block oil the distal side of the fusion site is highly homologous to sequences at 22qter. A third -100-kb segment is 96% identical to a region in 2qll.2. By integrating data on the extent and similarity of these paralogous blocks, including the presence of phylogenetically informative repetitive elements, with observations of their chromosomal distribution in nonhuman primates, we infer the order of the duplications that led to their current arrangement. Several of these duplicated blocks may be associated with breakpoints of inversions that occurred during primate evolution and of recurrent chromosome rearrangements in humans."
Natural concepts in a juvenile gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at three levels of abstraction,"['Vonk, J', 'MacDonald, SE']",JOURNAL OF THE EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF BEHAVIOR,10.1901/jeab.2002.78-315,NOV 2002,33,"The extent to which nonhumans are able to form conceptual versus perceptual discriminations remains a matter of debate. Among the great apes, only chimpanzees have been tested for conceptual understanding, defined as the ability to form discriminations not based solely on simple perceptual features of stimuli, and to transfer this learning to novel stimuli. In the present investigation, a young captive female gorilla was trained at three levels of abstraction (concrete, intermediate, and abstract) involving sets of photographs representing natural categories (e.g., orangutans vs. humans, primates vs. nonprimate animals, animals vs. foods). Within each level of abstraction, when the gorilla had learned to discriminate positive from negative exemplars in one set of photographs, a novel set was introduced. Transfer was defined in terms of high accuracy during the first two sessions with the new stimuli. The gorilla acquired discriminations at all three levels of abstraction but showed unambiguous transfer only with the concrete and abstract stimulus sets. Detailed analyses of response patterns revealed little evidence of control by simple stimulus features. Acquisition and transfer involving abstract stimulus sets suggest a conceptual basis for gorilla categorization. The gorilla's relatively poor performance with intermediate-level discriminations parallels findings with pigeons, and suggests a need to reconsider the role of perceptual information in discriminations thought to indicate conceptual behavior in nonhumans."
Evaluation of a method for typing the Microsatellite D1 2S391 locus using a new primer pair and capillary electrophoresis,"['Shigeta, Y', 'Yamamoto, Y', 'Doi, K', 'Miyaishi, S', 'Ishizu, H']",ACTA MEDICA OKAYAMA,NA,OCT 2002,6,"We describe a modified method for typing a polymorphic microsatellite D12S391 locus by PCR using a newly designed primer pair. This primer pair produces shorter D12S391 amplified fragments (104156 bp) than the primer pair originally described by Lareu et al. (209-261 bp). The detection system for the D12S391 locus using the new primer pair and capillary electrophoresis (CE) analysis was evaluated using various forensic samples. The typing results from 70 DNA samples using the new primer pair and the original primer pair were completely identical. One hundred twenty-five amplified fragments from D12S391 alleles were sized correctly within +/-0.25 by of the D12S391 allelic ladder. A rare allele, 19.3, previously found only in Caucasians, was found for the first time in a Japanese subject, and it was clearly distinguished from allele 20 by the CE analysis. This detection system was sensitive and could detect D12S391 types from 16 pg of genomic DNA, and from a minor component at a ratio of 1:10 in mixed samples. This system was more useful for the analysis of degraded DNA than was the method using the original primer pair, and could detect D12S391 types from bloodstains that had been stored for 26 years. In addition, the specificity of the method was demonstrated using nonhuman DNA."

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and intensity of intestinal parasites in a single group of mountain gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda over 7 weeks from June to August 2000. Fecal samples were collected from night nests and transported in formalin for examination at Cornell University and the Centers for Disease Control. All fecal samples were examined microscopically for parasitic larvae, cysts, and eggs. The following were found: strongylid eggs, Probstymaria sp. larvae, and two parasitic nematode larvae that were not identified. Additional examination techniques will be used to further examine the fecal material specifically for protozoan cysts. An increasing threat to this group of gorillas is the presence of local field assistants and researchers. We found no evidence of human parasites in the fecal samples from this gorilla group."
Early hominin limb proportions,"['Richmond, BG', 'Aiello, LC', 'Wood, BA', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.2002.0594,OCT 2002,62,"Recent analyses and new fossil discoveries suggest that the evolution of hominin limb length proportions is complex, with evolutionary reversals and a decoupling of proportions within and between limbs. This study takes into account intraspecific variation to test whether or not the limb proportions of four early hominin associated skeletons (AL 288-1, OH 62, BOUNP-12/1, and KNM-WT 15000) can be considered to be significantly different. from one another. Exact randomization methods were used to compare the differences between pairs of fossil skeletons to the differences observed between all possible pairs of individuals within large samples of Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, and Homo sapiens. Although the difference in humerofemoral proportions between OH 62 and AL 288-1 does not exceed variation in the extant samples, it is rare. When humerofemoral midshaft circumferences are compared, the difference between OH 62 and AL 288-1 is fairly common in extant species. This, in combination with error associated with the limb lengths estimates, suggests that it may be premature to consider H. (or Australopithecus) habilis as having more apelike limb proportions than those in A. afarensis. The humerofemoral index of BOU-VP-12/1 differs significantly from both OH 62 and AL 288-1, but not from KNM-WT 15000. Published length estimates, if correct, suggest that the relative forearm length of BOU-VP-12/1 is unique among hominins, exceeding those of the African apes and resembling the proportions in Pongo. Evidence that A. afarensis exhibited a less apelike uppenlower limb design than A. africanus (and possibly H. habilis) suggests that, if A. afarensis is broadly ancestral to A. africanus, the latter did not simply inherit primitive morphology associated with arboreality, but is derived in this regard. The fact that the limb proportions of OH 62 (and possibly KNM-ER 3735) are no more humanlike than those of AL 288-1 underscores the primitive body design of H. habilis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A single genotype of Encephalitozoon intestinalis infects free-ranging gorillas and people sharing their habitats in Uganda,"['Graczyk, TK', 'Bosco-Nizeyi, J', 'da Silva, AJ', 'Moura, INS', 'Pieniazek, NJ', 'Cranfield, MR', 'Lindquist, HDA']",PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH,10.1007/s00436-002-0693-5,OCT 2002,36,"Microsporidian spores have been detected by Chromotrope 2R and calcofluor stains in fecal samples of three free-ranging human-habituated mountain gorillas in Uganda and in two people who share gorilla habitats.

A single pathogen genotype in two genetically distant but geographically united host groups indicates anthropozoonotic transmission of Enc. intestinalis. It is highly unlikely that these two identical Enc. intestinalis genotypes were acquired independently by gorillas and people, it is much more probable that one group initiated infection of the other."
Molecular evolution of IgG subclass among nonhuman primates: Implication of differences in antigenic determinants among apes,"['Asada, Y', 'Kawamoto, Y', 'Shotake, T', 'Terao, K']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02629608,OCT 2002,2,"The cross-reactivity of five different rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human IgG and IgG subclass (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) was determined by competitive ELISA with nine nonhuman primate species including five apes, three Old World monkeys, and one New World monkey. As similar to those previously reported, the reactivity of anti-human IgG antibody with plasma from different primate species was closely related with phylogenic distance from human. Every anti-human IgG subclass antibody showed low cross-reactivity with plasma from Old World and New World monkeys. The plasma from all apes except for gibbons (Hylobates spp.) showed 60 to 100% of cross-reactivity with anti-human IgG2 and IgG3 antibodies. On the other hand, chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus) and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) plasma showed 100% cross-reactivity with anti-human IgG I antibody, but gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and gibbon plasma showed no cross-reactivity. The chimpanzee and gorilla plasma cross-reacted with anti-human IgG4 antibody at different reactivity, 100% in chimpanzee and 50% in gorilla, but no cross-reactivity was observed in orangutan and gibbon plasma. These results suggest the possibilities that the divergence of ""human-type"" IgG subclasses might occur at the time of divergence of Homo sapience from Hylobatidae, and that the molecular evolution of IgG1 as well as IgG4 is different from that of IgG2 and IgG3 in great apes, this is probably caused by different in development of immune function in apes during the course of evolution."
The function of male aggressive displays towards females in mountain gorillas,"['Sicotte, P']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02629603,OCT 2002,9,"In groups of Gorilla g. beringei, male aggression towards females regularly takes the form of male display. This paper examines male display towards females in two Karisoke study groups (Group 5 and Group BM) in 1989, a period when none of the females were new immigrants. Results are based on 259 hr of focal observations and 121 hr of ad libitum observations on male behaviors towards females. The goal is to see if the data are compatible with four non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to explain male displays towards females: (1) demonstration of male fighting abilities to influence female long term residence decision; (2) decrease potential competitive inequities between females; (3) provision to females of an occasion to confirm their subordinance to a male; and (4) short term influence on mating. First, male-female proximity was tested against proportion of male displays, to rule out the possibility that males display towards females simply because they happen to be close by. There was no association between proximity and male display. Dominant males were responsible for a higher proportion of displays than subordinate males. This is consistent with the idea that males display to demonstrate their fighting abilities, or their qualities as protector, since dominant males are the ones offering long term protection against infanticide and predators. Females that were in a position to transfer did not receive a higher proportion of male display, however. Long term resident dominant females received a higher proportion of displays from the dominant males, which is consistent with the idea that males attempt to decrease potential competitive inequities between females. There was an association between female appeasement reactions and male displays, which suggests that males display to create occasions for the females to confirm their subordinance to them. Estrous females did not receive a higher proportion of male displays, and there was no association between male display and copulation, suggesting that male displays are not a form of courtship aggression aimed at influencing mating in the short term."

Testing of fecal samples of gorillas (n=100), people sharing gorilla habitats (n=62), and local pre- and postweaned cattle (n=50) having access to these habitats with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibodies revealed Giardia duodenalis cysts at prevalences of 2, 5, and 10%, respectively. The identification of G. duodenalis was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization with 2 species-specific 18-bp oligonucleotide probes conjugated to hexachlorinated 6-carboxyfluorescein. The mean pathogen concentration was 2.5, 2.8, and 0.2x10(4) cysts/g of the gorilla, people, and cattle feces, respectively. All cyst isolates aligned with genotype (assemblage) A, as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of a 130-bp region near the 5' end of the small subunit-ribosomal RNA gene. A single genotype (assemblage) A recovered from 3 genetically distant but geographically united host groups indicates anthropozoonotic transmission of G. duodenalis. A large percentage of the local community does not follow park regulations regarding the disposal of their fecal waste, as self-reported in a questionnaire. This genotype may have been introduced into gorilla populations through habituation activities and may have then been sustained in their habitats by anthropozoonotic transmission."

Inactivation of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase occurred prior to brain expansion during human evolution,"['Chou, HH', 'Hayakawa, T', 'Diaz, S', 'Krings, M', 'Indriati, E', 'Leakey, M', 'Paabo, S', 'Satta, Y', 'Takahata, N', 'Varki, A']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.182257399,SEP 3 2002,154,"Humans are genetically deficient in the common mammalian sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) because of an Alu-mediated inactivating mutation of the gene encoding the enzyme CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) hydroxylase (CMAH). This mutation occurred after our last common ancestor with bonobos and chimpanzees, and before the origin of present-day humans. Here, we take multiple approaches to estimate the timing of this mutation in relationship to human evolutionary history. First, we have developed a method to extract and identify sialic acids from bones and bony fossils. Two Neandertal fossils studied had clearly detectable Neu5Ac but no Neu5Gc, indicating that the CMAH mutation predated the common ancestor of humans and Neandertals, approximate to0.5-0.6 million years ago (mya). Second, we date the insertion event of the inactivating human-specific sahAluY element that replaced the ancestral AluSq element found adjacent to exon 6 of the CMAH gene in the chimpanzee genome. Assuming Alu source genes based on a phylogenetic tree of human-specific Alu elements, we estimate the sahAluY insertion time at approximate to2.7 mya. Third, we apply molecular clock analysis to chimpanzee and other great ape CMAH genes and the corresponding human pseudogene to estimate an inactivation time of approximate to2.8 mya. Taken together, these studies indicate that the CMAH gene was inactivated shortly before the time when brain expansion began in humankind's ancestry, approximate to2.1-2.2 mya. In this regard, it is of interest that although Neu5Gc is the major sialic acid in most organs of the chimpanzee, its expression is selectively down-regulated in the brain, for as yet unknown reasons."
"Mother-infant interactions in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla): Spatial relationships, communication, and opportunities for social learning","['Maestripieri, D', 'Ross, SK', 'Megna, NL']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037//0735-7036.116.3.219,SEP 2002,27,"This study investigated mother-infant interactions in lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) with particular focus on the relative role of mothers and infants in creating situations that are potentially conducive to infant social learning. Eleven gorilla mother-infant dyads were focally observed in weekly 1-hr sessions for 12 months. Spatial relationships were affected by age as well as by ambient temperature. Although the youngest infant was encouraged by its mother to walk and climb, mothers showed little or no encouragement in other contexts. In contrast, infants were quite interested in their mothers' activities, on some occasions repeated their mother's behavior, and actively encouraged their mothers to share food, play, or follow them. These findings suggest that gorilla infants are more active than their mothers in creating situations that are potentially conducive to the acquisition of knowledge or skills."

Varied HIV-1 susceptibility and time to progression to AIDS have been associated with polymorphisms in CCR5. Many of these polymorphisms are located in the 5' cis-regulatory region of CCR5, suggesting that it may have been a target of natural selection. We characterized CCR5 sequence variation in this region in 400 chromosomes from worldwide populations and compared it to a genome-wide analysis of 100 AN polymorphisms typed in the same populations. Variation was substantially higher than expected and characterized by an excess of intermediate-frequency alleles. A genealogy of CCR5 haplotypes had deep branch lengths despite markedly little differentiation among populations. This finding suggested a deviation from neutrality not accounted for by population structure, which was confirmed by tests for natural selection. These results are strong evidence that balancing selection has shaped the pattern of variation in CCR5 and suggest that HIV-1 resistance afforded by CCR5 5' cis-regulatory region haplotypes may be the consequence of adaptive changes to older pathogens."
Evolution of a VNTR located within the promoter region of the thiopurine methyltransferase gene: inferences from population and sequence data,"['Alves, S', 'Amorim, A', 'Prata, MJ']",HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s00439-002-0784-5,AUG 2002,4,"The promoter region of the human thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) gene contains a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) with three kind of motifs (A, B, and C) differing by the length of the unit core and nucleotide sequence. We have studied the structural variation within the VNTR alleles in two human populations and in samples from gorillas and chimpanzees. In humans, no intermingling of motifs was detected within the VNTR, and the sequences of the three core motifs remained remarkably unchanged, differences between alleles corresponding essentially to variations in the number of A and B repeats. The variation pattern in humans is consistent with an interpretation in which two contiguous genetic units (repeats A and B) behave evolutionarily according to the stepwise mutation model, as inferred from the population distribution profiles and from the molecular phylogenetic relationships among the VNTR alleles. However, the observation of a strong negative correlation between the numbers of A and B repeats also suggests that the regularity and/or independence of the mutational process has been disrupted to some extent by interactions between the A and B stretches. Selective pressure (the VNTR plays some role, although minor, in the TPMT function) or biased mutation are possible explanations. In gorillas and chimpanzees, several A-, B-, or C-like motifs were detected, but their arrangement within the VNTR alleles did not followed the regular pattern registered in humans and, particularly for the B-like motifs, a considerable sequence hypervariability was registered. Furthermore, the structural differences among non-human alleles were sufficiently numerous to render more plausible the assumption of the infinite allele model."
Button osteoma: Its etiology and pathophysiology,"['Eshed, V', 'Latimer, B', 'Greenwald, CM', 'Jellema, LM', 'Rothschild, BM', 'Wish-Baratz, S', 'Hershkovitz, I']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10087,JUL 2002,10,"The present study investigates a circumscribed bony overgrowth on the cranial vault, known as button osteoma (BtO) and referred to here as button lesion (BtL). We discuss its anthropological implications. Data on its histology, location, and population distribution (by age, race, and gender) are provided.

Microscopically, BtL is composed of well-organized dense lamellated bone which is poorly vascularized and with very few osteocytes. It forms a dome-shaped roof over an underlying diploeized area which includes the ectocranial table.

The frequency of BtL is similar in modern (37.6%) and archaeological (41.1%) populations, in blacks, whites, males, and females, and correlates with age. It is rare in nonhuman primates. Fifty-five percent of the human skulls studied by us had BtL only on the parietal, 23,6% on the frontal, and 3.6% on the occipital bones. Fifteen percent had BtL on both the frontal and parietal bones. No lateral preference was found. Most skulls with BtL (64.1%) had only one lesion, 20.4% had two BtL, and 15.4% demonstrated multiple BtL, The average number of button osteomas on an affected skull was 1.97. The frequency of large osteomas (0.5-1.0 cm) was similar in young and old age groups.

The demographic characteristics of BtL, mainly its high frequency among ancient and modern populations, its independence of sex and race, its scarcity in other primates, and the fact that its macro- and microstruture are indicative of an hamartoma (and not an osteoma or exostosis) suggest an evolutionary background to the phenomenon.

A simple covarion-based approach to analyse nucleotide substitution rates,"['Siltberg, J', 'Liberles, DA']",JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00416.x,JUL 2002,34,"Using the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates (K-a/K-s) is a common approach for detecting positive selection. However, calculation of this ratio over a whole gene combines amino acid sites that may be under positive selection with those that are highly conserved. We introduce a new covarion-based method to sample only the sites potentially under selective pressure. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction over a phylogenetic tree coupled with calculation of K-a/K-s ratios, positive selection is better detected by this simple covarion-based approach than it is using a whole gene analysis or a windowing analysis. This is demonstrated on a synthetic dataset and is tested on primate leptin, which indicates a previously undetected round of positive selection in the branch leading to Gorilla gorilla."
Relative placement of the mandibular fossa in great apes and humans,"['Sherwood, RJ', 'Rowley, RB', 'Ward, SC']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.2002.0558,JUL 2002,5,"Several researchers have investigated, or commented on, the relative placement of the hominin mandibular fossa with regard to brain expansion and masticatory function. Two confounding factors are identified in this previous work. First, a number of different measurement techniques have been applied, confusing comparisons between studies. Second, the effects of squamous thickening due to temporal bone pneumatization are shown to influence measurements based relative to the ectocranial margin of the skull.

To investigate the influence of these factors, a sample of adult human (n = 12), chimpanzee (n = 12), gorilla (n = 15), and orang-utan (n = 8) skulls from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, University of Wisconsin Zoology Museum, and University of Wisconsin Anthropology collections, were CT scanned. Coronal scans were horizontally aligned and measured on a personal computer using ImageF (NIH). To identify fossa placement, fossa breadth was measured as the projected distance in the coronal plane between the tip of the entoglenoid to lateral margin of the articular surface. A second distance, from the tip of the entoglenoid to a sagittal plane, tangent to the lateralmost margin of the endocranial surface was taken to indicate the extent of medial placement of the fossa.

By eliminating the influence of pneumatization, these data unambiguously confirmed the medial placement of the human fossa and show all great apes as having a laterally placed fossa. Similar measurements on three fossil hominins, KNM-BC I (Homo sp. indet.), OH 5 and KNM-ER 23000 (Paranthropus boisei) demonstrate that, while all specimens demonstrate a broad fossa, only KNM-BC I is characterized by a relatively medial placement while the latter two display lateral placement.

Genetic and functional analysis of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene promoter,"['Zatyka, M', 'Morrissey, C', 'Kuzmin, I', 'Lerman, MI', 'Latif, F', 'Richards, FM', 'Maher, ER']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS,10.1136/jmg.39.7.463,JUL 2002,21,"The VHL gatekeeper turnout suppressor gene is inactivated in the familial cancer syndrome von Hippel-Lindau disease and in most sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinomas. Recently the VHL gene product has been identified as a specific component of a SCF-like complex, which regulates proteolytic degradation of the hypoxia inducible transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2. pVHL is critical for normal development and mRNA expression studies suggest a role in nephrogenesis. Despite the importance of VHL in oncogenesis and development, little is known about the regulation of VHL expression. To investigate VHL promoter activity, we performed comparative sequence analysis of human, primate, and rodent 5 VHL sequences. We then proceeded to deletion analysis of regions showing significant evolutionary conservation between human and rat promoter sequences, and defined two positive and one negative regulatory regions. Analysis of specific putative transcription factor binding sites identified a functional Sp1 site, which was shown to be a regulatory element. Overlapping Sp1/AP2 sites were also identified and candidate E2F1 binding sites evaluated. Three binding sites for as yet unidentified transcription factors were mapped also. These investigations provide a basis for elucidating the regulation of VHL expression in development, the molecular pathology of epigenetic silencing of VHL in tumourigenesis, and suggest a possible link between Sp1, VHL, and nephrogenesis."
Mineral content as a basis for food selection by western lowland gorillas in a forest clearing,"['Magliocca, F', 'Gautier-Hion, A']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.10034,JUN 2002,33,"The forests in northwest Republic of Congo contain a number of herbaceous swamp clearings that provide foraging sites for lowland gorillas (G.g. gorilla). A 10-month study at the Maya Nord clearing (Parc National d'Odzala) showed that feeding activities occupied 72% of the time visiting gorillas spent on the clearing. They fed on four plant species: Enydra fluctuans (Asteraceae), Cyperits sp., Pycreus mundtii, and Rhynchospora corymbosa (Cyperaceae) among the 45 species recorded on the clearing. These clearing food species have higher mineral contents (especially Na and Ca) than the dominant Marantaceae species (Haumania liebrechtsiana) that constituted a staple food plant for gorillas in this forest. They also have higher potassium contents and contain less lignin than non-eaten clearing items/species. Finally,the most actively searched for clearing food (Enydra fluctuans) was characterized by the highest amount of Na and Ca. These results suggest that the mineral content (especially in Na, Ca, and/or K) could determine the feeding selectivity of gorillas at the clearing. They also tend to confirm that the amount of fiber plays a deterrent role in food selectivity, as has been found by many authors. The high density of gorillas in that region could result from the combination of the large areas of Marantaceae forests that provide abundant though monotonous food, and the number of clearings that provide sufficient mineral supplies. Clearings should thus be considered as key habitats for the conservation of gorillas. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

In Experiment 1, following a retention interval of either approximately 7 min or 24 h, the gorilla responded with one of five cards, each corresponding to a particular food. The gorilla was accurate on 70% of the short retention-interval trials and on 82% of the long retention-interval trials. In Experiment 2, the food stimulus was provided by one of two experimenters, each of whom was represented by a card. The gorilla identified the food (55% of the time) and the experimenter (82% of the time) on the short retention-interval trials. On the long retention-interval trials, the gorilla was accurate for the food (73%) and for the person (87%). The results are interpreted in light of theories of episodic memory."

Although human presence in wildlife areas may provide an important economic benefit through ecotourism, exposure to human pathogens may represent a health risk for wildlife. This report is the first to document introduction of a primary human pathogen into free-ranging wildlife. We describe outbreaks of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a human pathogen, in free-ranging banded mongooses (Mungos mungo) in Botswana and suricates (Suricata suricatta) in South Africa. Wildlife managers and scientists must address the potential threat that humans pose to the health of free-ranging wildlife."
Identifying metameric variation in extant hominoid and fossil hominid mandibular molars,"['Hlusko, LJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10051,MAY 2002,9,"Landmark data were collected from cross sections and occlusal images of mandibular molar crowns, and Euclidean distance matrix analysis (EDMA) was used to identify metameric morphological variation between the first and second mandibular molars of living taxa: Gorilla gorilla (n = 30), Pan troglodytes (n = 34), and Homo sapiens (n 26). Two patterns of metameric variation were identified, one unique to humans and the other shared by chimpanzees and gorillas. In order to assess the utility of this type of analysis for the interpretation of the hominid fossil record, 19 mandibular molars from Sterkfontein Member 4, South Africa, were examined. The pattern of metameric variation of the Sterkfontein molars resembled that of the African great apes, and differed from the modern human pattern. These results demonstrate that data on metameric variation may provide information regarding function or developmental processes previously indiscernible from fossil material.

Another look at shape variation in the distal femur of Australopithecus afarensis: implications for taxonomic and functional diversity at Hadar,"['Lague, MR']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.2002.0545,MAY 2002,20,"Previous studies have recognized two patterns of distal femoral morphology among the specimens from Hadar (Ethiopia) assigned to Australopithecus afarensis. Size and shape differences between the well preserved large (AL 333-4) and small (AL 129-1a) distal femora have been used to invoke both taxonomic and functional differences within the A. afarensis hypodigm. Nevertheless, prior studies have not analyzed these specimens in a multivariate context, nor have they compared the pattern of shape differences between the fossils to patterns of sexual dimorphism among extant taxa (i.e., the manner in which males and females differ). This study reexamines morphometric differences between the above specimens in light of observed levels of variation and patterns of sexual dimorphism among extant hominoids.

Eight extant reference populations were sampled to provide a standard by which to consider size and shape differences between the fossils. Samples include three populations of modern humans, two subspecies of Pan troglodytes, three subspecies of Gorilla gorilla, Pan paniscus, and Pongo pygmaeus. Using size ratios and scale-free ""shape"" data (both derived from 2-D coordinate landmarks), size and shape differences between the fossils were evaluated against variation within each reference population using an exact randomization procedure. Growth Difference Matrix Analysis (GDMA) was used to test whether the pattern of morphological differences between the fossils differs significantly from patterns of sexual dimorphism observed among the ten extant groups. Overall morphometric affinities of the fossils to extant taxa were explored using canonical variates analysis (CVA).

Results of the randomization tests indicate that the size difference between the Hadar femora can be easily accommodated within most hominoid taxa at the subspecific level (though not within single-sex samples). In addition, the magnitude of shape differences between the fossils can be commonly sampled even within most single-sex samples of a single hominoid subspecies. The pattern of morphological differences between the fossils does not differ statistically from any average pattern of femoral shape dimorphism observed among living hominoids. Moreover, contrary to prior claims, and despite a size disparity between the fossils greater than is typically observed within some chimpanzee and human populations, the two Hadar fossils appear to be much more similar to one another in overall shape than either specimen is to any extant hominoid group.

"Primate hepatitis B viruses - genetic diversity, geography and evolution","['Robertson, BH', 'Margolis, HS']",REVIEWS IN MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/rmv.348,MAY-JUN 2002,44,"There are six well characterised genotypes (A-F) of human hepatitis B virus that have distinct geographic ranges which generally relate to chronic HBV infection. A seventh human genotype (G) has recently been described, but there is limited information on ethnic and geographic distribution. Despite the fact that early studies indicated that HBV antigens were present in other primates, the prevailing dogma that HBV was a human disease precluded alternative explanations. Within the past 5 years, hepatitis B viruses have been characterised from all the Old World great apes (orangutan, gibbons, gorillas and chimpanzees) and from a New World woolly monkey. Each group of non-human primates appears to have a distinct strain of hepatitis B virus that can be distinguished from human sequences based upon the nucleoticle sequence and selected amino acid changes in the viral proteins. The woolly monkey HBV is most divergent from other primate and human sequences, while the great ape HBV sequences cluster together with separate branches for each group.

An observation platform at the edge of the clearing was used over a 3-yr period, with gorillas visible for 1,681 hr. Data are presented on 14 groups and seven solitary males. Mean group size (excluding solitary males) was 8.4 +/- SD 4.3, and did not differ significantly from most other gorilla studies. All groups at Mbeli contained only one fully mature male and did not show evidence of fission-fusion or regular subgrouping. All emigrating males that remained in the population became solitary, and ""bachelor"" groups were not observed. Methodological issues are raised, including the classification of multi-male groups, and the demographic profiles of other populations are discussed in the light of results from Mbeli.

Infections with an animal-adapted genotype (Genotype 2) of Cryptosporidium parvum were found in a human population in Uganda that shares habitats with free-ranging gorillas, from which the same genotype of C. parvum had been recovered previously. A high prevalence of disease was found in park staff members (21%) who frequently contact gorillas versus 3% disease prevalence in the local community. This indicates a zoonotic transmission cycle of this pathogen against which no effective prophylaxis or therapy exists.

So far only the chromosome painting technique has been extensively used in studies of chromosomal evolution. This technique allows to detect only interchromosomal rearrangements. Human and Great Apes chromosomes basically differ by intrachromosomal rearrangements, in particular inversions; with chromosome painting it has just been possible to confirm the origin by fusion of human chromosome 2 and a reciprocal translocation in Gorilla, involving the homologous of chromosome 5 and 17. In order to verify intrachromosomal rearrangements in human chromosomal evolution, chromosome mapping of human loci in non-human primates is a useful approach. We mapped Miller-Diecker, Smith-Magenis and RARA loci localised on human chromosome 17, in Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, Macaca fascicularis and Cercopithecus aethiops. On the base of the obtained results it was possible to verify chromosomal rearrangements previously identified by banding, to achieve new informations about the controversial evolution of human chromosome 17, and to detect the occurrence of a paracentric inversion in the homologous in Cercopithecus aethiops."

These findings conflict with popular notions of distinct and relatively homogeneous human races, and may also call into question the apparent usefulness of ethnic classification in, for example, medical diagnostics. Here, we present new data oil 21 Alu insertions in 32 populations. We analyze these data along with three other large, globally dispersed data sets consisting of apparently neutral biallelic nuclear markers, as well as with a P-globin data set possibly subject to selection. We confirm the previous results for the autosomal data, and find a higher diversity among continents for Y-chromosome loci. We also extend the analyses to address two questions: (1) whether differences between continental groups, although small, are nevertheless large enough to confidently assign individuals to their continent on the basis of their genotypes; (2) whether the observed genotypes naturally cluster into continental or population groups when the sample source location is Ignored. Using a range of statistical methods, we show that classification errors are at best around 30% for autosomal biallelic polymorphisms and 27% for the Y chromosome. Two data sets suggest the existence of three and four major groups of genotypes worldwide, respectively, and the two groupings are inconsistent. These results suggest that, at random biallelic loci, there is little evidence, if any, of a clear subdivision of humans into biologically defined groups."
Complex SNP-based haplotypes in three human helicases: Implications for cancer association studies,"['Trikka, D', 'Fang, Z', 'Renwick, A', 'Jones, SH', 'Chakraborty, R', 'Kimmel, M', 'Nelson, DL']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.176702,APR 2002,17,"We have initiated a candidate gene approach to study variation and predisposition to cancer in the four major ethnic groups that constitute the U.S. population (African Americans, Caucasians, Hispanics, and Asians). We resequenced portions of three helicase genes (BLM, WRN, and RECQL) identifying a total of 37 noncoding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Haplotype inference predicted 50 haplotypes in BLM, 56 in WRN, and 47 in RECQL in a sample of 600 chromosomes. Approximately 10% of the predicted haplotypes were shared among all ethnic groups. Linkage disequilibrium and recombination effects showed that each locus has taken a diverse evolutionary path. Primate DNA analysis of the same loci revealed one human haplotype per gene shared with the great apes, indicating that the observed diversity occurred since the divergence of humans from the last common ancestor. In BLM, we confirmed the presence of a founder haplotype among Ashkenazi Jews homozygous for the blm(Ash) mutation. The cosegregating haplotype was seen in all (616) samples of Ashkenazi descent, whereas in the general population it has a low frequency (0.02) and was not found in African Americans. In WRN, ethnic samples were studied for their haplotype content and the presence or absence of six previously described coding SNPs (cSNPs). Hispanic individuals carrying two of these cSNPs showed a 60% increase In the frequency of a common haplotype (haplotype No. 28). In the pooled sample, no association was found. Because (1) the majority of the haplotypes are population specific and (2) the patterns of linkage disequilibrium, recombination, and haplotype diversity are markedly different between gene regions, these data show the importance of either ethnically matched controls or within-family-based disease-gene association studies."
Food preferences among captive western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Remis, MJ']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1013837426426,APR 2002,34,"I used a zoological park setting to address food preferences among gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorill) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Gorillas and chimpanzees are different sizes, and consequently, have been traditionally viewed as ecologically distinct. Sympatric western gorillas and chimpanzees have proved difficult to study, in the wild. Limited field data have provided conflicting information about whether gorillas are fundamentally, different from Chimpanzees in diet and behavior. Fruit eating shapes the behavior of most apes, but it is unclear whether the large-bodied gorillas are an exception to this rule, specifically whether they tire less selective and more opportunistic fruit eaters than chimpanzees are. My research provides experimental observational data to complement field data and to better characterize the diets and food preferences of the African apes. Daring laboratory research at the San Francisco Zoological Gardens, I examined individual and specific differences in food preferences of captive gorillas and chimpanzees via experimental paired-choice food trials with, foods that varied in nutritional content. During the study, I offered 2500 paired-food choices to 6 individual gorillas and 2000 additional pairs to them as a group. I also proffered 600 food pairs to 4 individual chimpanzees Despite expectations of the implications of body size differences for diet, gorillas and chimpanzees exhibited similar food preferences. Both species preferred foods high in non-starch sugars and sugar-to-fiber ratios, and low in total dietary fiber. Neither species avoided foods containing tannins. These data support other suggestions of African apes sharing a frugivorous adaptation."

We presented the subjects with 12 reference concentrations of 3-300 mM fructose, paired with tap water in paired-choice experimental trials. We subsequently, presented them with tap water paired with 8 dilute concentrations of tannic acid (0.25-6 mM) dissolved in 100 mM fructose solutions and 8 concentrations (0.25-6 mM) dissolved in 300 mM fructose solutions. The gorillas exhibited a broadly, similar preference threshold for fructose (50 mM) to those of other nonhuman primate and human samples. The gorillas tolerated moderate levels of tanninc acid, especially when presented in a very sweet package. The depressing effect of tannic acid on the ingestion of fructose solutions appeared to increase progressively, with tannin concentration and was lower as fructose concentration increased. The inhibition threshold for tannic acid solutions was reached at 4 mM tannic acid in 100 mM fructose solution, and at 6 mM tannic acid in 300 mM fructose solutions. These results suggest that gorillas use sweetness as a criterion for food selection and regard those with moderate levels of tannins as palatable. Our findings corroberate food preference studies and nutritional analyses of wild gorilla foods indicating that they prefer sugary, foods and readily, consume ones containing moderate levels of tannins. Taste responses may,facilitate a flexible frugivorous/folivorous diet among gorillas."

Immunoassays performed to detect hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers were negative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers overlapping the HBV core gene produced in amplicon of approximately 411 base pairs (bp) from serum DNA of a HBV-positive western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) but not from serum DNA of either lemur. Cesium chloride gradient fractions of liver homogenates from both lemurs contained a peak protein fraction with a density of 1.18 g/cm(3). Electron microscopic analysis of fraction contents, concentrated by ultracentrifugation, revealed numerous pleomorphic, spherical particles varying in diameter from 16-25 nm. In one of the lemurs, this peak fraction also contained a double-shelled virus-like particle 47-50 nm in diameter. The size, morphology, and density of these particles suggest they are members of the Hepadnaviridae, a group of hepatotropic DNA-genome viruses for which HBV is the prototype."
Habituating the great apes: the disease risks,"['Woodford, MH', 'Butynski, TM', 'Karesh, WB']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605302000224,APR 2002,77,"All six great apes, gorillas Gorilla gorilla and G, beringei, chimpanzees Pan troglodytes and R paniscus, and orang-utans Pongo pygmaeus and P, abehi, are categorized as Endangered on the 2000 IUCN Red List and face many threats to their continued existence in the wild. These threats include loss of habitat to settlement, logging and agriculture, illegal hunting for busameat and traditional medicine, the live ape trade, civil unrest and infectious diseases. The great apes are highly susceptible to many human diseases, some of which can be fatal while others can cause marked morbidity. There is increasing evidence that diseases can be transmitted from humans to free-living habituated apes, sometimes with serious consequences. If protective measures are not improved, ape populations that are frequently in close contact with people will eventually be affected by the inadvertent transmission of human diseases. This paper describes the risks, sources and circumstances of infectious disease transmission from humans to great apes during and consequent upon habituation for tourism and research, A major problem is that the regulations that protect habituated apes from the transmission of disease from people are often poorly enforced. Suggestions are made for improving the enforcement of existing regulations governing ape-based tourism, and for minimizing the risk of disease transmission between humans, both local people and international visitors, and the great apes."

The prevalence of cryptosporidiosis and giardiosis was 38% and 12%, respectively, with 10% concomitant infections. Shedding intensity varied from 130 to 450 oocysts/ g (mean of 215 oocysts/g) and from 110 to 270 cysts/g (mean of 156 cysts/g). Significantly more pre-weaned than post-weaned cattle were infected with either parasite, and the pre-weaned cattle shed significantly higher numbers of either parasite than the post-weaned cattle. Mathematical modeling indicated that the maximum prevalence of asymptomatic infections can reach approximately 80% for cryptosporidiosis and 35% for giardiosis in the sampled cattle. Because C. parvum and G. duodenalis recovered from cattle can infect people and gorillas, cattle that graze within the Bwindi Park should be considered as a significant reservoir of these anthro-pozoonotic parasites."

Original parameters, called elliptical Fourier descriptors, allowed for the quantification of the shape of an outline irrespective of its morphological complexity, and provided a precise individual characterization. The use of step by step reconstructions with an increasing number of harmonies allowed for demonstration of the morphological contributions of the elliptical Fourier descriptors, and relationships to precise anatomical features were established. The first harmonics (1st to 8th) described the general mandibular shape, and the later harmonics (8th to 14th) characterized accessory and finer morphological features. The proportion of individuals presenting significant sexual dimorphism was 97.1% in males and 91.7% in females, and after size normalization 84.1% in males and 81.2% in females. Even after removal of the size component, these results in regard to mandibular dimorphism remained better than those found by classical approaches; this could be due to the use of elliptical Fourier analysis which takes into account all the information of the mandibular outline. Compared to the size component, the shape component seemed to be more important in the sexual dimorphism of the human mandible than previously recognized. The present approach opens interesting anthropological and clinical perspectives for the characterization of mandibular morphology."
"Pneumatized spaces, sinuses and spongy bones in the skulls of primates.","['Preuschoft, H', 'Witte, H', 'Witzel, U']",Anthropologischer Anzeiger; Bericht uber die biologisch-anthropologische Literatur,NA,2002-Mar,28,"The earliest attempts to understand the ""pneumatized spaces"" in the skulls of primates in general were focussed on the hollow spaces and the epithelium which covers their surfaces. More recent approaches consider the sinuses as a means to optimise skull architecture. Still, many attempts to get hold of the meaning of the intriguing pneumatized spaces circle around the air filled volumes they enclose. Here, we would like to reverse the approach and focus our biomechanic interpretation on the walls surrounding the big, empty, or at least not mechanically resistant spaces, and their mechanical properties. As a working hypothesis, we consider not only the walls of the more or less closed cavities, or sinuses, but also the braincase, the orbits, and the nasal channel as thin-walled shells of which we know that they can carry surprisingly large loads with a minimum of material. Details of the wall's profiles fit with this approach. From the same viewpoint, the bubble-like, air-filled cavernous systems in the ethmoid or temporal bones, and the marrow-filled spongy substance in the upper jaw are looked at as honeycomb-structures, which provide mechanical properties that are biologically advantageous and allow the saving of weight."
Identification and cross-species comparisons of CYP2F subfamily genes in mammals,"['Chen, N', 'Whitehead, SE', 'Caillat, AW', 'Gavit, K', 'Isphording, DR', 'Kovacevic, D', 'McCreary, MB', 'Hoffman, SMG']",MUTATION RESEARCH-FUNDAMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF MUTAGENESIS,10.1016/S0027-5107(01)00274-3,FEB 20 2002,10,"The cytochrome P450 2F (CYP2F) subfamily genes are currently known only from cDNA sequences in human, mouse, rat and goat. Compared to other divisions of the CYP2 gene family, the CYP2F subfamily is unusual in having few genes per species and in being selectively expressed in lung tissues. Sequencing genomic DNAs from human and gorilla has allowed us to determine the number of CYP2F subfamily loci in these species, the sources of known human transcripts, and the functional status of CYP2F loci in both primates. This information will make accurate genotyping of the functional and medically significant CYP2F1 gene possible in humans. Comparisons across multiple species show that the sequences of CYP2F subfamily genes are very conserved in mammals for intronic as well as exonic DNA. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Masticatory form and function in the African apes,"['Taylor, AB']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10013,FEB 2002,80,"This study examines variability in masticatory morphology as a function of dietary preference among the African apes. The African apes differ in the degree to which they consume leaves and other fibrous vegetation. Gorilla gorilla beringei, the eastern mountain gorilla, consumes the most restricted diet comprised of mechanically resistant foods such as leaves, pith, bark, and bamboo. Gorilla gorilla gorilla, the western lowland gorilla subspecies, consumes leaves and other terrestrial herbaceous vegetation (THV) but also consumes a fair amount of ripe, fleshy fruit. In contrast to gorillas, chimpanzees are frugivores and rely on vegetation primarily as fallback foods. However, there has been a long-standing debate regarding whether Pan paniscus, the pygmy chimpanzee (or bonobo), consumes greater quantities of THV as compared to Pan troglodytes, the common chimpanzee. Because consumption of resistant foods involves more daily chewing cycles and may require larger average bite force, the mechanical demands placed on the masticatory system are expected to be greater in folivores as compared to primates that consume large quantities of fleshy fruit. Therefore, more folivorous taxa are predicted to exhibit features that improve load-resistance capabilities and increase force production.

To test this hypothesis, jaw and skull dimensions were compared in ontogenetic series of G. g. beringei, G. g. gorilla, P. t. troglodytes, and P. paniscus. Controlling the influence of allometry, results show that compared to both chimpanzees and bonobos, gorillas exhibit some features of the jaw complex that are suggestive of improved masticatory efficiency. For example, compared to all other taxa, G. g. beringei has a significantly wider mandibular corpus and symphysis, larger area for the masseter muscle, higher mandibular ramus, and higher mandibular condyle relative to the occlusal plane of the mandible. However, the significantly wider mandibular symphysis may be an architectural response to increasing symphyseal curvature with interspecific increase in size. Moreover, Gorilla and Pan do not vary consistently in all features, and some differences run counter to predictions based on dietary variation. Thus, the morphological responses are not entirely consonant with predictions based on hypothesized loading regimes. Finally, despite morphological differences between bonobos and chimpanzees, there is no systematic pattern of differentiation that can be clearly linked to differences in diet. Results indicate that while some features may be linked to differences in diet among the African apes, diet alone cannot account for the patterns of morphological variation demonstrated in this study. Allometric constraints and dental development also appear to play a role in morphological differentiation among the African apes. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
"Urinary androgen and corticoid levels in captive, male western lowland gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla): Age- and social group-related differences","['Stoinski, TS', 'Czekala, N', 'Lukas, KE', 'Maple, TL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.1065,FEB 2002,26,"Urinary androgen and corticoid levels were measured for 52 captive male Western lowland gorillas to examine age-related variance and potential differences resulting from various social situations. Significant diurnal variation was present in both hormones. Age-related differences in androgens revealed that males experienced two stages of androgen increase and one stage of decrease: increases occurred from juvenile (less than 10 yr of age) to subadult (between 10-13 yr) and subadult to young adult (14-20 yr), whereas decreases occurred from young adult to adult (> 20 yr). Age-related differences in corticoid levels varied depending on the time of day, but morning corticoids were greatest in juvenile males, followed by young adult males. The type of social grouping was associated with differences in corticoid levels, as animals housed socially (in either a heterosexual or all-male group) had similar corticoid levels, whereas solitary males showed greater corticoid levels than their socially-housed counterparts. The increased levels of corticoids in solitary-housed males suggest this management strategy might not be optimal, although more data are needed. Additionally, the significantly greater levels of androgens and corticoids in young adult male gorillas may present management challenges, and thus zoos may need to consider increasing the flexibility of their current management practices with respect to males.

All four members of a gorilla group which had been habituated to tourists were clinically affected; the infant male gorilla was most severely affected and died, the juvenile male showed serious manifestations of the disease and the two adult animals showed milder signs. The three older animals recovered after a single intramuscular dose of ivermectin. S scabiei mites were observed on skin scrapings and biopsies taken while the juvenile was immobilised and in postmortem samples taken from the infant. The clinical signs did not recur during the following year, and no other gorilla groups in the park were observed to be clinically affected."

Estimation of large mammal densities in the Ipassa-Makokou reserve (Gabon),"['Okouyi, JO', 'Posso, P', 'Lepretre, A', 'Scaps, P']",BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE ZOOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE,NA,2002,2,"The UNESCO reserve Man and Biosphere (MAB) of Ipassa-Makou, located in north-east Gabon (Central Africa), was well studied by the scientists of the CNRS (Centre national de la recherche scientifique) from 1963 to 1985 (more than 400 publications, collections, an herbarium, a scientific journal Biologica gabonica and infrastructures which could receive scientists in the forest). In consequence, the vertebrate fauna of the reserve is particularly well known: 128 mammal species, 424 bird species, 65 reptile species and 47 amphibian species. Unfortunately, the reserve was abandoned by the CNRS in 1985 and by scientists in general. Since that time, the reserve has been submitted to high human pressures (poaching, agriculture). The main goal of this study is to survey the present reserve faunistic resources. In order to estimate the densities of some species of macro-mammals still present in the reserve, we conducted line-transect censures. We censured elephants, monkeys and duikers because they are the main preoccupation of researchers and wildlife managers in African rain forests. We conducted censures during two periods between 2000 (May-September) and 2001 (April-June). Eight censures were carried out on each side of the Niabare River in order to cover the reserve (100 km(2)). Each census route covered 5 km and we walked each census five times. We used identical methods during censures. Observers conducted all censures between 07:30 and 12:30 h. During each census, we walked slowly, travelling approximately 1 km per h, and pausing at regular intervals to scan the forest. Data were obtained from direct (individuals or group of individuals sighted) and indirect (chimpanzee and gorilla nests, elephant dung piles) observations.

Results indicate that, in spite of high human pressure, all the large taxe are still present in the reserve. The densities observed are generally similar to those found in African rain forests. Nevertheless, some local variations were detected. The most abundant cercopithecines species present in the reserve are greater white-nosed monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans) (56,43 ind/km(2)), moustached monkeys (Cercopithecus cephus) (19.08 ind/km(2)) and mona monkeys (Cercopithecus pogonias) (7.07 ind/km(2)). If greater white-nosed monkeys are the most abundant diurnal primates present in the reserve, it is not the case in the north-east Gabon forests where mona monkeys are more numerous. On the contrary to the cercopithecines, duikers densities are relatively low. The estimated density of blue duikers (Cephalophus monticola) is 8.04 ind/km(2). Nevertheless, in the eighties, densities were estimated to be over than 50 ind/km(2). This result indicates that blue duikers may have experienced significant reduction over the past 20 years at Ipassa-Makokou. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are still present in the reserve while they have disappreared upstream of the Ivindo great river. Estimate of lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) density is 0.75 ind/km(2) and is greater than that previously censured in the region (0.44 ind/km(2)). This difference may be explained by the fact that a group of individuals would have crossed the reserve during the census period. Estimates of elephant (Loxodonta africana) abundance from indirect (dung piles) and direct observations are respectively 0.58 ind/km(2) and 1.10 ind/km(2). These densities are in the range of those censured in West Africa (Ghana, Ivory Coast and Central African Republic)

All these results confer a particular interest on this reserve which is located near the town of Makokou and which can serve as a model for conservation purposes in the region."
Comparative mapping of CDY and DAZ in higher primates,"['Wimmer, R', 'Kuhl, H', 'Rottger, S', 'Schempp, W']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000063021,2002,7,"The human male specific expressed gene families CDY and DAZ are known to be repetitively clustered in the Y-specific region of the human Y chromosome.

Human chromosome 15q11-q14 regions of rearrangements contain clusters of LCR15 duplicons,"['Pujana, MA', 'Nadal, M', 'Guitart, M', 'Armengol, L', 'Gratacos, M', 'Estivill, X']",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS,10.1038/sj/ejhg/5200760,JAN 2002,59,"Six breakpoint regions for rearrangements of human chromosome 15q11-q14 have been described. These rearrangements involve deletions found in approximately 70% of Prader-Willi or Angelman's syndrome patients (PWS, AS), duplications detected in some cases of autism, triplications and inverted duplications. HERC2-containing (HEct domain and RCc1 domain protein 2) segmental duplications or duplicons are present at two of these breakpoints (13132 and BP3) mainly associated with deletions. We show here that clusters containing several copies of the human chromosome 15 low-copy repeat (LCR15) duplicon are located at each of the six described 15q11-q14 BPS. In addition, our results suggest the existence of breakpoints for large 15q11-q13 deletions in a proximal duplicon-containing clone. The study reveals that HERC2-containing duplicons (estimated on 50-400 kb) and LCR15 duplicons (similar to 15 kb on 15q11-q14) share the golgin-like protein (GLP) genomic sequence. Through the analysis of a human BAC library and public databases we have identified 36 LCR15 related sequences in the human genome, most (27) mapping to chromosome 15q and being transcribed. LCR15 analysis in non-human primates and age-sequence divergences support a recent origin of this family of segmental duplications through human speciation."
Mutations in the factor IX gene (F9) during the past 150 years have relative rates similar to ancient mutations,"['Feng, JN', 'Drost, JB', 'Scaringe, WA', 'Liu, Q', 'Sommer, SS']",HUMAN MUTATION,10.1002/humu.10018,2002,4,"Pollutants and dietary mutagens have been associated with somatic mutation and cancer, but the extent of their influence on germline mutation is not clear. Since deleterious germline mutations can be transmitted for thousands of years, any influence on germline mutation from the vast increase in man-made chemicals of the past 150 years would be an important public health issue. Observed disease causing mutations in the X-linked factor IX gene (F9) of hemophilia B patients originated predominantly in the past 150 years, since the half-life of these mutations in human populations had been about two generations before effective treatment became available about a generation ago. Recent changes in germline mutational processes may be detected by comparison of the observed hemophilia B causing mutation pattern in F9 with the pattern of neutral polymorphisms which occurred over a much longer period of time. By scanning a total of 1.5 megabases of deep intronic regions of F9 in the genomic DNA from 84 individuals, 42 neutral polymorphisms were found in 23 haplotypes that differed by at least 11 mutations from the ancestral primate haplotype. By sequencing F9 in seven non,human primates, 39 of these polymorphisms were characterized as ancient mutations relative to a unanimous ancestral primate allele. This ancient mutation pattern was compared to the recent pattern of hemophilia B causing mutations. Remarkably, no significant difference was found (P=0.5), suggesting that the vast increase in man-made chemicals during the past 150 years has not had a major impact on the pattern of human germline mutation. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that endogenous processes dominate germline mutation. Hum Mutat 19:49-57, 2002. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Soft-tissue anatomy of the extant hominoids: a review and phylogenetic analysis,"['Gibbs, S', 'Collard, M', 'Wood, B']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1046/j.0021-8782.2001.00001.x,JAN 2002,49,"This paper reports the results of a literature search for information about the soft-tissue anatomy of the extant non-human hominoid genera, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo and Hylobates, together with the results of a phylogenetic analysis of these data plus comparable data for Homo. information on the four extant non-human hominoid genera was located for 240 out of the 1783 soft-tissue structures listed in the Nomina Anatomica. Numerically these data are biased so that information about some systems (e.g. muscles) and some regions (e.g. the forelimb) are over-represented, whereas other systems and regions (e.g. the veins and the lymphatics of the vascular system, the head region) are either under-represented or not represented at all. Screening to ensure that the data were suitable for use in a phylogenetic analysis reduced the number of eligible soft-tissue structures to 171. These data, together with comparable data for modern humans, were converted into discontinuous character states suitable for phylogenetic analysis and then used to construct a taxon-by-character matrix. This matrix was used in two tests of the hypothesis that soft-tissue characters can be relied upon to reconstruct hominoid phylogenetic relationships. In the first, parsimony analysis was used to identify cladograms requiring the smallest number of character state changes. In the second, the phylogenetic bootstrap was used to determine the confidence intervals of the most parsimonious clades. The parsimony analysis yielded a single most parsimonious cladogram that matched the molecular cladogram. Similarly the bootstrap analysis yielded clades that were compatible with the molecular cladogram; a (Homo, Pan) clade was supported by 95% of the replicates, and a (Gorilla, Pan, Homo) clade by 96%. These are the first hominoid morphological data to provide statistically significant support for the clades favoured by the molecular evidence."

Change of enclosure in langur monkeys: Implications for the evaluation of environmental enrichment,"['Little, KA', 'Sommer, V']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.10058,2002,19,"A group of Hanuman langurs (Presbytis entellus) was studied before and after it was moved from an old cage-style enclosure to a novel naturalistic environment at the London Zoo. Eating and locomotion occupied more of the langurs' time in their new enclosure, whereas dozing, allogrooming, and aggression decreased, along with an increase in inter-individual distances. These changes are attributed to the larger area, the stimulating new environment, and the langurs' increased distance from visitors. Nevertheless, the study raises questions about how to define standards of desirable environmental enrichment, as the activity patterns recorded in both the old and new enclosures are within the variation observed in the wild."
Tripedal knuckle-walking: A proposal for the evolution of human locomotion and handedness,"['Kelly, RE', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,10.1006/jtbi.2001.2421,DEC 7 2001,11,"A comparative morphological analysis of human and non-human hominoids was conducted in an attempt to determine the mode of locomotion of the protohominid. Although the generalized hominoid anatomy permits variation of locomotion: brachiation, knuckle-walking, etc., minor variations in structure determine which behavior is favored. Arboreal arm swinging requires a flexible forelimb while terrestrial fist or knuckle-walking demands more rigidity of the hand and wrist. It is demonstrated that the large human thumb accompanied by the strong adduction of the thenar, hypothenar, and palmar interosseous muscles offer powerful rigidity to the hand, while fusion of the os centrale with the scaphoid during gestation permits the formation of an arch of carpals which imbue the wrist with the stability necessary for weight bearing. Fascialization of the contrahentes and dorsiepitrochlearis muscles in the human as well as depilation of the middle phalanges; the webbing (syndactyly) of the palm; the direction of the fibers of the interosseous membrane of the forearm; the shape of the puerile annular ligament, and the direction of the human glenoid fossa strongly suggest that the ancestor of man used a knuckle-walking form of locomotion prior to becoming bipedal. A model is presented that suggests that bipedalism was attained through an intermediate stage of tripedalism. The model is based on the fact that man's anatomy is much more asymmetric than that of the great apes. A presumption is made that due to the absence of trees for climbing in the transition from forest to open plain, the protohominid needed to carry tools (stones) at all times for protection. Stones could be carried for long distances on the posterior iliac crest since the weight would be shifted posteriorly over the legs. Pick up, medial rotation and adduction of the stone would employ a two-muscle chain of biceps brachii and latissimus dorsi. On the iliac crest, the stone is posterior to the coronal plane of the glenohumeral joint, and with the contraction of this two-muscle chain, the shoulder on one side is moved posteriorly effecting a semi-erect posture. It is proposed that tripedalism of the protohominid may be an explanation for the handedness unique to hominids. (C) 2001 Academic Press."
Primate molar crown formation times and life history evolution revisited,"['Macho, GA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.1054,DEC 2001,41,"Comparative studies have convincingly demonstrated that the pattern and timing of tooth emergence are highly correlated with life-history variables and brain size. Conversely, a firm relationship between molar formation time and life-history variables has not yet been established. It seems counterintuitive that one aspect of dental development should be correlated with life-history variables, whereas the other should not. In order to shed light on this apparent discrepancy this study analyzed all data on primate molar crown formations available in the published literature in relation to life-history variables, brain size, and female body mass. Crown formation times were found to be particularly highly correlated with both female body mass and brain size. Species that depart from the overall brain/body allometry by being relatively large-bodied, e.g., Gorilla gorilla and later Theropithecus oswaldi, also have shorter molar crown formation times than expected. The reverse is not found for species that depart from the overall brain/body allometry due to their larger brains, i.e., Homo sapiens. This finding is interpreted within an evolutionary and ecological framework. Specifically, by focusing on ecological commonalities, a scenario is proposed which may allow predictions to be made about the evolutionary history of other extinct primates also. If confirmed in future studies, crown formation time may again become a powerful tool in evolutionary enquiry. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

In this study we investigated whether prepartum titers of urinary estrone conjugates (E1C) or pregnanediol-3 alpha -glucuronide (PdG) were related to postpartum maternal behavior in eight multiparous Western lowland gorilla females (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) housed in four zoological gardens. Urine samples were collected from each study animal for 14 days prepartum and 14 days postpartum, and measures of maternal responsiveness were scored during the first 15 days postpartum. Urine samples were assayed with radioimmunoassay for E1C and PdG. Results for the peripartum profiles of urinary E1C, as well as postpartum profiles of PdG, agree with previous findings for the gorilla, while results for late-pregnancy profiles of urinary PdG were inconclusive in confirming a prepartum increase or decrease. Neither prepartum levels of E1C or PdG, nor the E1C/PdG ratio were found to be related to measures of postpartum maternal behavior. This lack of association between late-pregnancy E1C titers per se and postpartum maternal behavior is contrary to findings in nonprimate and other primate species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science."

During routine health monitoring, five juvenile gorillas were observed with active crusted dermatitis and alopecia. Papular and vesicular lesions and crusts with papular eruption and oozing were numerous and disseminated over the body of one gorilla with a confirmed infestation of scabies. In this gorilla, the hyperkeratotic crusts were loose and thick with a flaky and scaly appearance. Histologically, the epidermis was thickened, displayed hyperkeratosis and was infiltrated with lymphocytes and neutrophils. Examination of skin scraping yielded a positive identification of adults and eggs of Sarcoptes scabiei mites. The gorillas were treated with ivermectin, 200 mg(.)kg(-1). As S. scabiei mites can cross-infect various mammalian species causing self-limiting dermatitis, these ectoparasites can be propagated in the habitats shared by gorillas, people, and livestock, and therefore they represent an anthropozoonotic threat."

Paired chimpanzee hepatitis B virus (ChHBV) and mtDNA sequences suggest different ChHBV genetic variants are found in geographically distinct chimpanzee subspecies,"['Hu, XL', 'Javadian, A', 'Gagneux, P', 'Robertson, BH']",VIRUS RESEARCH,10.1016/S0168-1702(01)00334-3,NOV 5 2001,22,"The surface antigen gene region from five chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected chimpanzees was amplified by PCR and the sequence determined. Sequence comparison confirmed that all of the sequences were chimpanzee hepatitis B virus (chHBV) and they appeared to represent three distinct clusters or branches. To address the question of whether the three branches represented recently identified subspecies of chimpanzees, we determined the sequence of the mitochondrial DNA hypervariable D loop from hair samples obtained from these five chimpanzees. The results indicated that the three chHBV branches reflected three distinct subspecies of chimpanzees that are from different geographic regions in West Africa. The complete HBV sequence from members of the Pan troglodytes troglodytes cluster and the Pan troglodytes verus cluster are in the published literature; we determined the complete genome sequence for the third branch of HBV present in Pan troglodytes vellerosus.

Enamel hypoplasia in the deciduous teeth of great apes: Variation in prevalence and timing of defects,"['Lukacs, JR']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.1115,NOV 2001,11,"The prevalence of enamel hypoplasia in the deciduous teeth of great apes has the potential to reveal episodes of physiological stress in early stages of ontogenetic development. However, little is known about enamel defects of deciduous teeth in great apes. Unresolved questions addressed in this study are: Do hypoplastic enamel defects occur with equal frequency in different groups of great apes? Are enamel hypoplasias more prevalent in the deciduous teeth of male or female apes? During what phase of dental development do enamel defects tend to form? And, what part of the dental crown is most commonly affected?

To answer these questions, infant and juvenile skulls of two sympatric genera of great apes (Gorilla and Pan) were examined for dental enamel hypoplasias. Specimens from the Powell-Cotton Museum (Quex Park, UK; n = 107) are reported here, and compared with prior findings based on my examination of juvenile apes at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History (Hamman-Todd Collection; n = 100) and Smithsonian Institution (National Museum of Natural History; n = 36). All deciduous teeth were examined by the author with a X 10 hand lens, in oblique incandescent light. Defects were classified using Federation Dentaire International (FDI)/Defects of Dental Enamel (DDE) standards; defect size and location on the tooth crown were measured and marked on dental outline charts. Enamel defects of ape deciduous teeth are most common on the labial surface of canine teeth. While deciduous incisor and molar teeth consistently exhibit similar defects with prevalences of similar to 10%, canines average between 70-75%. Position of enamel defects on the canine crown was analyzed by dividing it into three zones (apical, middle, and cervical) and calculating defect prevalence by zone. Among gorillas, enamel hypoplasia prevalence increases progressively from the apical zone (low) to the middle zone to the cervical zone (highest), in both maxillary and mandibular canine teeth.

Results from all three study collections reveal that among the great apes, gorillas (87-92%) and orangutans (91%) have a significantly higher prevalence of canine enamel defects than chimpanzees (22-48%). Sex differences in canine enamel hypoplasia are small and not statistically significant in any great ape. Factors influencing intergroup variation in prevalence of enamel defects and their distribution on the canine crown, including physiological stress and interspecific dento-gnathic morphological variation, are evaluated.

Do gorilla females join males to avoid infanticide? A quantitative model,"['Harcourt, AH', 'Greenberg, J']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1006/anbe.2001.1835,NOV 2001,35,"Gorilla, Gorilla gorilla, females associate permanently with males. What benefit do the females obtain from the association? Where males are larger than females, as in the gorilla, protection from predation is the long-standing answer. However, protection from infanticidal nonfather males is increasingly suggested as a better hypothesis. Given that a female's alternative strategy is to range alone and mate with many males, a hitherto ignored problem of the anti-infanticide hypothesis is that a female's joining a single male necessarily maximizes the proportion of males in the population who can use the infanticidal strategy. To ask whether lone gorilla females could mate with enough males to decrease the probability of infanticide below that observed in the wild, we use novel modifications of a gas molecule equation to model encounter rates of a lone female with males. The modifications include separation of encounter rates in fertile periods from those in nursing periods and, importantly, a decline function that converts infanticidal males to noninfanticidal, on mating. Parameters include density of males, speed of travel, and duration of fertile and nursing periods. In two other great apes (chimpanzee Pan, orang-utan Pongo), females are more or less solitary, and infanticide rates are very low (less than or equal to5%). With these species' values in the model, equivalently low infanticide rates result. Thus, the model appears valid. For the gorilla, the model indicates that under most realistic conditions, solitary females mate with so few males that infanticide rates are more than three times the observed rate of 14% of births. Association with a male thus decreases the probability of infanticide. The anti-infanticide hypothesis for grouping is thus supported. But the antipredation hypothesis is not thereby negated, and remains a powerful hypothesis, given that predators are a danger to the female, as well as her infant.

"Seed dispersal by a diurnal primate community in the Dja Reserve, Cameroon","['Poulsen, JR', 'Clark, CJ', 'Smith, TB']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,NA,NOV 2001,54,"Multiple species of primate disperse seeds and differentially contribute to the seed rain in tropical forests. The goal of this study was to examine seed dispersal by a primate community of five monkey and two ape species in the Dja Reserve, Cameroon. The density of primates in the reserve was calculated to be 77 individuals km(-2). Analysis of 5789 faecal clumps demonstrated that 40% of monkey and 74% of ape faecal clumps possessed whole seeds. Six of the seven focal species acted as seed dispersers; faecal clumps passed by the black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza) did not contain any whole seeds during the study. Seed passage trials on four captive monkey species showed monkeys to have an average seed passage time of 22 hours and defecation rate of five times per day. From the above results, the primate community was estimated to defecate 1129 seeds km(-2) d(-1). Seeds passed by the primate community came from 125 species of trees, lianas and shrubs, equivalent to at least 34% of the known tree flora. Rarefaction curves indicated that additional collection effort would identify more seed species passed by primates. Germination studies demonstrated that primate-passed seeds are viable. The number of seeds and plant species dispersed suggests that the primate community plays an important role in the maintenance of forest structure."
Evaluation of methods for determination of a reconstructed history of gene sequence evolution,"['Liberles, DA']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,NOV 2001,44,"With whole-genome sequences being completed at an increasing rate, it is important to develop and assess tools to analyze them. Following annotation of the protein content of a genome, one can compare sequences with previously characterized homologous genes to detect novel functions within specific proteins in the evolution of the newly sequenced genome. One common statistical method to detect such changes is to compare the ratios of nonsynonymous (K-a) to synonymous (K-s) nucleotide substitution rates. Here, the effects of several parameters that can influence this calculation (sequence reconstruction method, phylogenetic tree branch length weighting, GC content, and codon bias) are examined. Also, two new alternative measures of adaptive evolution, the point accepted mutations (PAM)/neutral evolutionary distance (NED) ratio and the sequence space assessment (SSA) statistic are presented. All of these methods are compared using two sequence families: the recent divergence of leptin orthologs in primates, and the more ancient divergence of the deoxyribonucleoside kinase family. The examination of these and other measures to detect changes of gene function along branches of a phylogenetic tree will become increasingly important in the postgenomic era."

"Modern African ape populations as genetic and demographic models of the last common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas","['Jensen-Seaman, MI', 'Deinard, AS', 'Kidd, KK']",JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,10.1093/jhered/92.6.475,NOV-DEC 2001,34,"In order to fully understand human evolutionary history through the use of molecular data, it is essential to include our closest relatives as a comparison. We provide here estimates of nucleotide diversity and effective population size of modern African ape species using data from several independent noncoding nuclear loci, and use these estimates to make predictions about the nature of the ancestral population that eventually gave rise to the living species of African apes, including humans. Chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas possess two to three times more nucleotide diversity than modern humans. We hypothesize that the last common ancestor (LCA) of these species had an effective population size more similar to modern apes than modern humans. In addition, estimated dates for the divergence of the Homo, Pan, and Gorilla lineages suggest that the LCA may have had stronger geographic structuring to its mtDNA than its nuclear DNA, perhaps indicative of strong female philopatry or a dispersal system analogous to gorillas, where females disperse only short distances from their natal group. Synthesizing different classes of data, and the inferences drawn from them, allows us to predict some of the genetic and demographic properties of the LCA of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas."

Episodic memory in primates,"['Schwartz, BL', 'Evans, S']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.1041,OCT 2001,37,"Episodic memory refers to a system of memory with the capacity to recollect specific events from an individual's life. Some psychologists have suggested that episodic memory is a uniquely human phenomenon. We challenge that idea and present evidence that great apes and other primates may possess episodic-like memory. We review criteria developed to assess episodic-like memory in nonhumans, and how they apply to primates. In particular, we discuss the criteria of Clayton et al. [2001], who stated that episodic-like memory is based on the retrieval of multiple and integrated components of an event. We then review eight studies examining memory in great apes and apply the Clayton et al. criteria to each of them. We summarize the evidence that is compatible with the existence of episodic-like memory, although none of the data completely satisfy the Clayton et al. criteria. Morover, feelings of pastness and feelings of confidence, which mark episodic memory in humans, have not been empirically addressed in nonhuman primates. Future studies should be directed at these aspects of memory in primates. We speculate on the functional significance of episodic memory in nonhuman primates. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Neuroanatomical localization of the motor hand area with magnetic resonance imaging: The left hemisphere is larger in great apes,"['Hopkins, WD', 'Pilcher, DL']",BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE,10.1037/0735-7044.115.5.1159,OCT 2001,26,"Magnetic resonance images of the brain were obtained from 2 gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), 4 orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), 14 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and 4 bonobos (Pan paniscus). The region on the motor cortex of humans identified as responsible for motor skill of the hand (the ""knob"") was identified in this sample on consecutive 1-mm axial scans. The shape of the knob area was traced on each scan from both hemispheres, and the area from all scans was summed to calculate the knob volume, The width of the knob was also measured and correlated highly with knob volume. A significant population-level leftward asymmetry in the volume and width of the knob was revealed (p < .05). Species differences in knob asymmetry and overall volume were not significant, but the variability in overall volume between species was substantial. Selection for the evolution of a neuroanatomical representation of the hand in primates and an evolutionary trend toward population-level right handedness are discussed."
CAG repeat instability at SCA2 locus: anchoring CAA interruptions and linked single nucleotide polymorphisms,"['Choudhry, S', 'Mukerji, M', 'Srivastava, AK', 'Jain, S', 'Brahmachari, SK']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/10.21.2437,OCT 2 2001,61,"Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that results from the expansion of a cryptic CAG repeat within the exon 1 of the SCA2 gene. The CAG repeat in normal individuals varies in length from 14 to 31 repeats and is frequently interrupted by one or more CAA triplets, whereas the expanded alleles contain a pure uninterrupted stretch of 34 to 59 CAG repeats. We have previously reported the presence of a limited pool of 'ancestral' or 'at risk' haplotypes for the expanded SCA2 alleles in the Indian population. We now report the identification of two novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exon 1 of the SCA2 gene and their characterization in 215 normal and 64 expanded chromosomes. The two biallelic SNPs distinguished two haplotypes, GT and CC, each of which formed a predominant haplotype associated with normal and expanded SCA2 alleles. All the expanded alleles segregated with CC haplotype, which otherwise was associated with only 29.3% of the normal chromosomes. CAA interspersion analysis revealed that majority of the normal alleles with CC haplotype were either pure or lacked the most proximal 5' CAA interruption. The repeat length variation at SCA2 locus also appeared to be polar with changes occurring mostly at the 5' end of the repeat. Our results demonstrate that CAA interruptions play an important role in conferring stability to SCA2 repeat and their absence predisposes alleles towards instability and pathological expansion. Our study also provides new haplotypes associated with SCA2 that should prove useful in further understanding the mutational history and mechanism of repeat instability at the SCA2 locus."
"Nutritional aspects of western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) diet during seasons of fruit scarcity at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic","['Remis, MJ', 'Dierenfeld, ES', 'Mowry, CB', 'Carroll, RW']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1012021617737,OCT 2001,57,"Traditionally, gorillas were classified as folivores, yet 15 years of data on western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) show their diet to contain large quantities of foliage and fruit, and to vary both seasonally and annually. The consumption of fruit by gorillas at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic, is correlated with rainfall and ripe fruit availability (Remis, 1997a). We investigated the nutritional and chemical content of gorilla foods consumed at Bai Hokou during two seasons of fruit scarcity as measured by phenological observations and compared our findings with the nutrient content of gorilla foods at other African sites. We conclude that during lean times, Bai Hokou gorillas consumed fruits with higher levels of fiber and secondary compounds than those of other populations of western lowland or mountain gorillas. Conversely, leaves consumed by Bai Hokou gorillas were relatively low in fiber and tannins. Bai Hokou gorillas appeared to meet their nutritional needs by eating a combination of fruit and foliage. They ate fruits comparatively high in secondary compounds and fiber when necessary. While gorillas are selective feeders, wherever and whenever preferred foods a re scarce, their large body size and digestive anatomy enable them to consume and process a broader repertoire of foods than smaller bodied-apes."
Developmental aspects of sexual dimorphism in hominoid canines,"['Schwartz, GT', 'Reid, DJ', 'Dean, C']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1012073601808,OCT 2001,55,"We examined the histology of canine teeth in extant hominoids and provided a comparative database on several aspects of canine development. The resultant data augment the known pattern of differences in aspects of tooth crown formation among great apes and more irnportantly, enable us to determine the underlying developmental mechanisms responsible for canine dimorphism in them. We sectioned and analyzed large sample (n = 108) of reliably-sexed great ape mandibular canines according to standard histological techniques. Using information from long- and short-period incremental markings in teeth, we recorded measurements of daily secretion rates, periodicity and linear enamel thickness for specimens of Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus and Homo sapiens. Modal values of periodicities in males and females, respectively, are: Pan 7/7; Gorilla 9/10; Pongo 10/10; and Homo 8/8. Secretion rates increase from the inner to the outer region of the enamel cap and decrease from the cuspal towards the cervical margin of the canine crown in all great ape species. Female hominoids tend to possess significantly thicker enamel than their male counterparts, which is almost certainly related to the presence of faster daily secretion rates near the enamel-dentine junction, especially in Gorilla and Pongo. Taken together, these results indicate that sexual differences in canine development are most apparent in the earlier stages of canine crown formation, while interspecific differences are most apparent in the outer crown region. When combined with results on the rate and duration of canine crown formation, the results provide essential background work for larger projects aimed at understanding the developmental basis of canine dimorphism in extant and extinct large-bodied hominoids and eventually in early hominins."
"A novel, nonclassical MHC class I molecule specific to the common chimpanzee","['Adams, EJ', 'Cooper, S', 'Parham, P']",JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY,NA,OCT 1 2001,16,"All expressed human MHC class I genes (HLA-A, -B, -C, -E, -F, and -G) have functional orthologues in the MHC of the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). In contrast, a nonclassical MHC class I gene discovered in the chimpanzee is not present in humans or the other African ape species. In exons and more so in introns, this Patr-AL gene is similar to the expressed A locus in the orangutan, Popy-A, suggesting they are orthologous. Pair-AL/Popy-A last shared a common ancestor with the classical MHC-A locus >20 million years ago. Population analysis revealed little Patr-AL polymorphism: just three allotypes differing only at residues 52 and 91. Patr-AL is expressed in PBMC and B cell lines, but at low level compared with classical MHC class I. The Patr-AL polypeptide is unusually basic, but its glycosylation, association with beta (2)-microglobulin, and antigenicity at the cell surface are like other MHC class I. No Patr-AL-mediated inhibition of polyclonal chimpanzee NK cells was detected. The Patr-AL gene is present in 50% of chimpanzee MHC haplotypes, correlating with presence of a 9.8-kb band in Southern blots. The flanking regions of Patr-AL contain repetitive/retroviral elements not flanking other class I genes. In sequenced HLA class I haplotypes, a similar element is present in the A*2901 haplotype but not the A*0201 or A*0301 haplotypes. This element, 6 kb downstream of A*2901, appears to be the relic of a human gene related to Patr-AL. Patr-AL has characteristics of a class I molecule of innate immunity with potential to provide common chimpanzees with responses unavailable to humans."
Biomechanical scaling of the hominoid mandibular symphysis,"['Daegling, DJ']",JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY,10.1002/jmor.1055,OCT 2001,38,"Experimental investigation of mandibular bone strain in cercopithecine primates has established that the mandible is bent in the transverse plane during the power stroke of mastication. Additional comparative work also supports the assumption that the morphology of the mandibular symphysis is functionally linked to the biomechanics of lateral transverse bending, or ""wishboning"" of the mandibular corpus. There are currently no experimental data to verify that lateral transverse bending constitutes an important loading regime among hominoid primates. There are, however, allometric models from cercopithecoid. primates that allow prediction of scaling patterns in hominoid mandibular dimensions that would be consistent with a mechanical environment that includes wishboning as a significant component. This study uses computed tomography (CT) scans to visualize cortical bone distribution in the anterior corpus of a sample of four genera of extant hominoids. From the cortical bone contours, area properties of the mandibular symphysis are calculated, and these variables are subjected to an allometric analysis to detect whether scaling of jaw dimensions are consistent with a wishboning loading regime. Scaling of the hominoid symphysis recalls patterns observed in cercopithecoid monkeys, which lends indirect support for the hypothesis that wishboning is an integral part of the masticatory loading environment in living apes. Inclination of the symphysis, rather than changes in cross-sectional shape or development of the superior transverse torus, represents a morphological solution for minimizing the potentially harmful effects of wishboning in the jaws of these primates.

A total of 145 gorilla nests in 27 nest sites was found. We found 82. 1% of gorilla nests > 2 m above ground. There was a significant correlation between the height of nests and the diameter of trees with nests. The density was estimated at 0.34-0.40 weaned gorillas per km(2) depending on the value of nest site decay rate used. The herbaceous vegetation was scarce in the study site (42 out of 50 quadrats had no herbaceous stems). Compared with the gorilla population of the nearby Dzanga-Sangha forest, the population density of gorillas at Ngotto was lower but the proportion of nests found above ground was much higher. These differences are discussed and we suggest that they were the result of the scarcity of herbaceous vegetation in the Ngotto forest."
Monitoring the reproductive status of female gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) by measuring the steroid hormones in fecal samples,"['Miyamoto, S', 'Chen, Y', 'Kurotori, H', 'Sankai, T', 'Yoshida, T', 'Machida, T']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02629620,OCT 2001,7,"The reproductive status of female gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) was estimated by measuring the sex steroid hormones in fecal samples instead of in blood samples. Fecal samples from female gorillas were used to examine the reliability of this non-invasive assay system, which included the extraction method for estradiol-17beta (E-2) and progesterone (P) from fecal samples. Fecal samples from three female gorillas were collected daily for about 55 days, and fecal E2 and P were assayed to clarify the fluctuation patterns of these steroids in the feces. Fecal sampling from one female was repeated for another 50-day period (starting 75 days after the end of the first observation period) and assayed to confirm if the menstrual cycle of this subject was ovulatory. Although fecal E-2 concentration measurements were quantitative by using this assay system, fecal P concentration measurements were semi-quantitative. Relative amounts of fecal P in fecal samples were estimated by using the values of B/B-0 (bound/total binding in the radioimmunoassay system). Two of the four fluctuation patterns of fecal hormones observed throughout the menstrual cycle for the three female gorillas were typical for normal ovulatory cycles. In the subject observed for two periods, one pattern was typical and the other atypical. The results show that this non-invasive method is simple and practical for monitoring the reproductive status of great apes as well as Old World monkeys."
The subspecies concept in primatology: The case of mountain gorillas,"['Stanford, CB']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02629622,OCT 2001,9,"The criteria for the application of subspecific units in living primate populations have received little attention relative to other vertebrate taxa, even though they have important implications for conservation strategies for many nonhuman primate populations. One of the most critically endangered primates is the mountain gorilla, Gorilla gorilla beringei, of which 600 animals exist in east-central Africa. Following SARMIENTO et al. (1996), taxonomists have proposed splitting these populations into two subspecies as part of a revised taxonomy of the genus Gorilla. In this paper I review the application of the subspecies concept in primatology, using the gorillas of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and the Virungas as case studies. An examination of genetic, morphological, biogeographic, ecological, and behavioral evidence indicates that reclassifying Bwindi gorillas as taxonomically distinct from those in the Virungas is not well supported and needs further study. Because taxonomy provides the basis of conservation management policies, a cautious and conservative approach to the subspecies question is warranted in the case of endangered primate populations."

We have found that, although a region containing a 92-bp exon and an AluSq element in the hydroxylase gene is intact in all nonhuman primates examined, the same region in the human genome is replaced by an AluY element that was disseminated at least one million years ago. We propose a mechanistic model for this Alu-mediated replacement event, which deleted the 92-bp exon and thus inactivated the human hydroxylase gene. It is suggested that AN elements have played potentially important roles in genotypic and phenotypic evolution in the hominid lineage."
Glucocorticoid stimulates primate but inhibits rodent alpha-fetoprotein gene promoter,"['Nakabayashi, H', 'Koyama, Y', 'Sakai, M', 'Li, HM', 'Wong, NCW', 'Nishi, S']",BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS,10.1006/bbrc.2001.5564,SEP 14 2001,13,"Glucocorticoids inhibit rodent a-fetoprotein (AFP) gene activity but stimulate expression of the human homologue. Like human, activity of the AFP promoter from other primates was stimulated by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) in various cell lines. A glucocorticoid responsive element (GRE) is located within 180 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site of all AFP genes examined. Comparative analysis of the GRE in the two different groups of promoters revealed a common 3' hexamer, 5'-TGTCCT-3', but the 5' hexamers were different. This difference converts the rodent GRE to a DR-1 motif. DR-1 is a binding site for members of the nuclear receptor superfamily including the orphan receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4). The presence of DR-1 in the rodent but not human may underlie the opposite actions of Dex on the AFP promoter. We tested this hypothesis using a transient transfection assay. In hepatoma cells that expressed GR and HNF-4, reporter-activity was inhibited by Dex. The same construct in nonhepatoma cells was strongly induced by over expression of HNF-4 and the induced activity was inhibited by Dex. The findings show that Dex induction of human AFP is mediated by a GRE. But Dex repression of the rodent promoter requires a DR-1 motif that interacts with GR and HNF-4. (C) 2001 Academic Press."

Although the presence of two distinct lineages of KSHV-like rhadinoviruses, RV1 and RV2, has been revealed in Old World primates (including African green monkeys, macaques, and, recently, mandrills), viruses belonging to the RV2 genogroup have not yet been identified from great apes. Indeed, the three yet known gamma2-herpesviruses in chimpanzees (PanRHV1a/PtRV1, PanRHV1b) and gorillas (GorRHV1) belong to the RV1 group. To investigate the Putative existence of a new RV2 Rhadinovirus in chimpanzees and gorillas we have used the degenerate consensus primer PCR strategy for the Herpesviral DNA polymerase gene on 40 wild-caught animals. This study led to the discovery, in common chimpanzees, of a novel gamma2-herpesvirus belonging to the RV2 genogroup, termed Pan Rhadino-herpesvirus 2 (PanRHV2). Use of specific primers and internal oligonucleotide probes demonstrated the presence of this novel gamma2-herpesvirus in three wild-caught animals. Comparison of a 1092-bp fragment of the DNA polymerase obtained from these three animals of the Pan troglodytes troglodytes subspecies, one from Gabon and the two others from Cameroon, revealed <1% of nucleotide divergence. The geographic colocalization as well as the phylogenetic ""relationship"" of the human and simian gamma2-herpesviruses support the model according to which herpesviruses have diversified from a common ancestor in a manner mediating cospeciation of herpesviruses with their host species. By demonstrating the existence of two distinct Rhadinovirus lineages in common chimpanzees, our finding indicates the possible existence of a novel human gamma2-herpesvirus belonging to the RV2 genogroup."

Subsequent video analysis of gorillas' behavior showed a significant tendency to copy the observed technique on 1 of the individual defenses and the direction of removal on another defense. This is the first statistically reliable evidence of imitation in gorillas. Sequence of defense removal was not replicated. The gorillas' responses were most similar to those of chimpanzees."
Mitochondrial DNA variation and biogeography of eastern gorillas,"['Jensen-Seaman, MI', 'Kidd, KK', 'GRAUERS GORILLA']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1046/j.0962-1083.2001.01365.x,SEP 2001,64,"Mitochondrial DNA variation in 109 individuals from four populations of wild living gorillas in East Africa was ascertained by sequencing the first hypervariable segment of the control region, or 'D-loop'. amplified from noninvasively collected hair and faeces. D-loop haplotypes from eastern gorillas fell into two distinct clades, each with low levels of genetic diversity; most observed haplotypes within each clade differing by only one or two mutations. Both clades show evidence of population bottlenecks in the recent past, perhaps concomitant with the tropical forest reduction and fragmentation brought on by global cooling and drying associated with the last glacial maximum."
Excess of rare amino acid polymorphisms in the toll-like receptor 4 in humans,"['Smirnova, I', 'Hamblin, MT', 'McBride, C', 'Beutler, B', 'Di Rienzo, A']",GENETICS,NA,AUG 2001,98,"The Toll-like receptor 4 protein acts as the transducing subunit of the lipopolysaccharide receptor complex and assists in (fie detection of Gram-negative pathogens within the mammalian host. Several lines of evidence support the view that variation at the TLR4 locus may alter host susceptibility to Gram-negative infection or the outcome of infection. Here, we surveyed TLR4 sequence variation in the complete-coding region (2.4 kb) in 348 individuals from several population samples; in addition, a subset of the individuals was surveyed at 1.1 kb of intronic sequence. More than 90% of the chromosomes examined encoded the same structural isoform of TLR4, while the rest harbored 12 rare amino acid variants. Conversely, the variants at silent sites (intronic and synonymous positions) occur at both low and high frequencies and are consistent with a neutral model of mutation and random drift. The spectrum of allele frequencies for amino acid variants shows a significant skew toward lower frequencies relative to both the neutral model and the pattern observed at linked silent sites. This is consistent with the hypothesis weak purifying selection acted oil TLR4 and that most mutations affecting TLR4 protein structure have at least mildly deleterious phenotypic effects. These results may imply that genetic variants contributing to disease susceptibility occur at low frequencies in the population and suggest strategies for optimizing the design of disease-mapping studies."
Sequence variation within the fragile x locus,"['Mathews, DJ', 'Kashuk, C', 'Brightwell, G', 'Eichler, EE', 'Chakravarti, A']",GENOME RESEARCH,NA,AUG 2001,10,"The human genome provides a reference sequence, which is a template for resequencing studies that aim to discover and interpret the record of common ancestry that exists in extant genomes. To understand the nature and pattern of variation and linkage disequilibrium comprising this history, we present a study of similar to 31 kb spanning an similar to 70 kb region of FMR1, sequenced in a sample of 20 humans (worldwide sample) and four great apes (chimp, bonobo, and gorilla). Twenty-five polymorphic sites and two insertion/deletions, distributed in It unique haplotypes, were identified among humans. Africans are the only geographic group that do not share any haplotypes with other groups. Parsimony analysis, reveals two main clades and suggests that the four major human geographic groups are distributed throughout the phylogenetic tree and within each major clade. An African sample appears to be most closely related to the common ancestor shared with the three other geographic groups. Nucleotide diversity, pi, for this sample is 2.63 +/- 6.28 x 10(-4). The mutation rate, mu, is 6.48 x 10(-10) per base pair per year, giving an ancestral population size of similar to 6200 and a time to the most recent common ancestor of similar to 320,000 +/- 72,000 per base pair per year. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) at the FMR1 locus, evaluated by conventional LD analysis and by the length of segment shared between any two chromosomes, is extensive across the region."
Management of hepatitis B virus infections in two gibbons and a western lowland gorilla in a zoological collection,"['Thornton, SM', 'Walker, S', 'Zuckerman, JN']",VETERINARY RECORD,NA,JUL 28 2001,4,"Since 1996, three primates newly arrived at London Zoo have been found to be infected with hepatitis B virus.

The protocols for the practical management of these cases, including the immunisation of susceptible non-human primates and the staff with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine are described, and the origin and evolution of hepatitis B infection in primates are discussed."

Phenetic trees confirm a morphological gradient from neonate to adult, with more obvious sexual dimorphism in gorillas. By quantifying morphological change through vector field, the spatial arrangement of cranio-facial growth in the two species can be represented and compared. We conclude that differences in the timing of development (acceleration, pie-displacement, rate hypermorphosis by acceleration and time hypermorphosis by post-displacement) give rise to the intra- and interspecific variation observed in the ""great apes"" ontogenetic plan.

The evolutionary chromosome translocation 4;19 in Gorilla gorilla is associated with microduplication of the chromosome fragment syntenic to sequences surrounding the human proximal CMT1A-REP,"['Stankiewicz, P', 'Park, SS', 'Inoue, K', 'Lupski, JR']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.181101,JUL 2001,73,"Many genomic disorders occur as a result of chromosome rearrangements involving low-copy repeats (LCRs). To better understand the molecular basis of chromosome rearrangements, including translocations, we have investigated the mechanism of evolutionary rearrangements. In contrast to several intrachromosomal rearrangements, only two evolutionary translocations have been identified by cytogenetic analyses of humans and greater apes. Human chromosome 2 arose as a result of a telomeric fusion between acrocentric chromosomes, whereas chromosomes 4 and 19 in Gorilla gorilla are the products of a reciprocal translocation between ancestral chromosomes, syntenic to human chromosomes 5 and 17, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to characterize the breakpoints of the latter translocation at the molecular level. We identified three BAC clones that span translocation breakpoints. One breakpoint occurred in the region syntenic to human chromosome 5q13.3, between the HMG-CoA reductase gene (HMGCR) and RAS p21 protein activator 1 gene (RASA1). The second breakpoint was in a region syntenic to human chromosome 17p12 containing the 24 kb region-specific low-copy repeat-proximal CMTIA-REP. Moreover, we found that the t(4;19) is associated with a submicroscopic chromosome duplication involving a 19p chromosome fragment homologous to the human chromosome region surrounding the proximal CMTIA-REP. These observations further indicate that higher order genomic architecture involving low-copy repeats resulting from genomic duplication plays a significant role in karyotypic evolution."
"""Bar-coding"" primate chromosomes: molecular cytogenetic screening for the ancestral hominoid karyotype","['Muller, S', 'Wienberg, J']",HUMAN GENETICS,NA,JUL 2001,60,"Two recently introduced multicolor FISH approaches, cross-species color banding (also termed Rx-FISH) and multiplex FISH using painting probes derived from somatic cell hybrids retaining fragments of human chromosomes, were applied in a comparative molecular cytogenetic study of higher primates. We analyzed these ""chromosome bar code"" patterns to obtain an overview of chromosomal rearrangements that occurred during higher primate evolution. The objective was to reconstruct the ancestral genome organization of hominoids using the macaque as outgroup species. Approximately 160 individual and discernible molecular cytogenetic markers were assigned in these species. Resulting comparative maps allowed us to identify numerous intra-chromosomal rearrangements, to discriminate them from previous contradicting chromosome banding interpretations and to propose an ancestral karyotype for hominoids. From 25 different chromosome forms in an ancestral karyotype for all hominoids of 2N=48 we propose 21. Probes for chromosomes 2p, 4, 9 and Y were not informative in the present experiments. The orangutan karyotype was very similar to the proposed ancestral organization and conserved 19 of the 21 ancestral forms; thus most chromosomes were already present in early hominoid evolution, while African apes and human show various derived changes."
Behavioral responses of an infant gorilla to maternal separation in a captive social group of lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Nakamichi, M', 'Silldorff, A', 'Sexton, P']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02629640,JUL 2001,2,"The present report describes behavioral reactions of a 33-month-old female infant gorilla to maternal separation in a captive social group whose composition is similar to that of wild groups. The infant gorilla responded differently to two types of maternal separation. When she remained alone for a few hours, she cried repeatedly and moved restlessly, indicating protest. Upon reunion and also for a few days thereafter, an intensification of the mother-infant relationship occurred. On the other hand, when she was separated from her mother but remained with the other group members for nine days, she did not display any behaviors that could be characterized as protest, but rather showed clear behavioral depression. During the 9-day separation period, she hardly played with other group members but she developed affiliative relationships with the leading male. After the reunion from the 9-day separation, she spent as much time near her mother as before separation and played with other infants at a level similar to that before separation, while she sometimes displayed behavioral patterns demanding the maintenance of physical contact with her mother. The present findings are compared with other reports in great apes and human children."
Human identification from forensic materials by amplification of a human-specific sequence in the myoglobin gene,"['Ono, T', 'Miyaishi, S', 'Yamamoto, Y', 'Yoshitome, K', 'Ishikawa, T', 'Ishizu, H']",ACTA MEDICA OKAYAMA,NA,JUN 2001,3,"We developed a method for human identification of forensic biological materials by PCR-based detection of a human-specific sequence in exon 3 of the myoglobin gene. This human-specific DNA sequence was deduced from differences in the amino acid sequences of myoglobins between humans and other animal species. The new method enabled amplification of the target DNA fragment from 30 samples of human DNA, and the amplified sequences were identical with that already reported. Using this method, we were able to distinguish human samples from those of 21 kinds of animals: the crab-eating monkey, horse, cow, sheep, goat, pig, wild boar, dog, raccoon dog, cat, rabbit, guinea pig, hamster, rat, mouse, whale, chicken, pigeon, turtle, frog, and tuna. However, we were unable to distinguish between human and gorilla samples. This method enabled us to detect the target sequence from 25 pg of human DNA, and the target DNA fragment from blood stored at 37 degreesC for 6 months, and from bloodstains heated at 150 degreesC for 4 h or stored at room temperature for 26 years. Herein we also report a practical application of the method for human identification of a bone fragment."

Two of the infants are likely to be monozygotic twins as determined by DNA analysis. Growth curves were fitted to serial measures of cephalo-thoracic-abdominal length, arm length, leg length, head circumference, upper arm circumference, and weight from each gorilla, to describe individual patterns of variation in skeletal growth and body composition. Growth in skeletal measures tended to be curvilinear to varying degrees over the first year of life. Body composition varied more than skeletal measures throughout the first year as a consequence of individual health status. Individual growth and body composition variations appear to reflect both genetic and environmental influences in this small sample of captive infant gorillas. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Seasonal variation in the feeding ecology of the grey-cheeked mangabey (Lophocebus albigena) in Cameroon,"['Poulsen, JR', 'Clark, CJ', 'Smith, TB']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.1015,JUN 2001,44,"Seasonal fluctuations in resource abundance often cause primates to change their feeding behavior and ecology. The objective of this study was to examine the response of a largely frugivorous monkey, the grey-checked mangabey (Lophocebus albigena), to seasonal variations in fruit abundance. We used 15-min scan sampling to quantify feeding, activity, and habitat use by monkeys between February and December 1998 in the Dja Reserve, Cameroon. L. albigena were found to have omnivorous feeding habits, consuming the fruits, seeds, leaves, and flowers of 132 plant species. Although monkeys fed from many plant species, only five plant species accounted for 45% of all feeding records. The number of feeding observations on a plant species was significantly correlated with its fruit production. L. albigena responded to fruit-lean periods by shifting from a diet dominated by fruit to one dominated by seeds, flowers, and young leaves, This diet shift coincided with greater use of swamp habitat and higher dietary diversity. L. albigena spent the greatest percentage of scan samples feeding and traveling, but activities varied significantly over the day. Individuals spent a significantly higher percentage of scan samples feeding during the fruit-rich season than in the fruit-lean season. Comparing our results to those of studies in Gabon and Uganda, we found that L. albigena differ across regions in the number of plant species they consume and time spent feeding. These differences may be a result of variations in tree diversity or the strength of seasonal fluctuations in resource abundance among sites. Am. J. Primatol. 54:91-105, 2001.

Sequence information for some of these loci (FGA, vWA, TH01) is an extension of published work, whereas no extensive sequence information is available with respect to the D3S1358, CSF1PO, and TPOX loci. Sequencing of alleles at each locus has provided quantitative data with respect to the true nucleotide length of common alleles, and of alleles that vary in length from the common alleles. All alleles that were identified as ""off-ladder"" alleles through fluorescent typing at these STR loci have proven to be true length variant alleles. Sequencing at the D3S1358 and CSF1PO loci allowed for the establishment of a common nomenclature for these loci. A correlation between percent stutter and the length of the core tandem repeat is demonstrated at the FGA locus. Alleles in which the core tandem repeat is interrupted by a repeat unit of different sequence have a reduced percent stutter. DNA samples from three non-human primates (chimpanzee, orangutan, and gorilla) were compared to the human sequences, and shown to differ markedly across loci with respect to their homology. The effects of primer binding site mutations on the amplification efficiency at a particular locus, and methods used to interpret amplification imbalance of heterozygous alleles at a locus is also addressed.

In an effort to identify Y-linked, testis-expressed genes, a cDNA selection library was generated by selecting testis cDNA with Y-cosmid clones. Resultant clones containing repetitive or vector material were eliminated, and 79 of the remaining clones were sequenced. Nineteen cDNAs showed homology with the TTY2 gene, and indicated that TTY2 is part of a large gene family. Screening of a panel of Y-linked cosmids revealed that the TTY2 gene family includes at least 26 members organized in 14 subfamilies. Further investigation revealed that TTY2 genes are arranged in tandemly arrayed clusters on both arms of the Y chromosome, and each gene comprises a series of tandemly arranged repeats. RT-PCR studies for two of these genes revealed that they are expressed in adult and fetal testis, as well as in the adult kidney. None of the genes investigated in derail contain an open reading Frame. We conclude that the TTY2 gene family is composed of multiple copies, some of which may function as noncoding RNA transcripts and some may be pseudogenes."

The substitution rate on the pseudogene (1.23 +/- 0.22 x 10(-9) per nucleotide and year) is within the range of previous estimates considering phylogenetic estimations. Recombination within the pseudogene was recognized, although the low variability of this locus prevented an accurate measure of recombination rates. At least 13% of the psGBA sequence could be attributed to gene conversion from the contiguous GBA gene, whereas the reciprocal event has been shown to lead to Gaucher disease. Human psGBA sequences showed a recent coalescence time (similar to 200,000 yr ago), acid the most ancestral haplotype was found only in Africans; both observations are compatible with the replacement hypothesis of human origins. In a deeper timeframe, phylogenetic analysis showed that the duplication event that created psGBA could be dated at similar to 27 million years ago, in agreement with previous estimates."
Habitat use and structural preferences of captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla): Effects of environmental and social variables,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Hoff, MP', 'Maple, TL']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1010707712728,JUN 2001,25,"Exhibit naturalism has become the architectural standard for Mew zoo exhibits, yet our scientific understanding of how animals interact with naturalistic environments is very limited. Given the expense incurred in building new exhibits, it is essential that more information on animal-environment interactions be obtained and that it be incorporated at the outset into exhibit designs. We documented four years of habitat use and structure preferences of western lowland gorillas at Zoo Atlanta. We found that quality of space rather than quantity of space was important, as subjects spent 50% of their time in < 15% of the exhibits. Subjects showed strong preferences for the areas near structures, particularly the holding building, and spent significantly less time away from structures than expected. Temperature interacted with structural preferences in that the subjects spent more time away front structures when temperatures were cold and more time near them when temperatures were hot. There was no difference in habitat use and structural preferences due to age, sex, and rearing history, but social factors appear to play a role. Our results are similar to those found a decade earlier in the same population and to other studies of space use in apes but are the first to include significant temperature effects. Additionally, they suggest that managers and designers need to take into account factors such ns quality of space, attractivensss of the holding building, and the interaction of structural preferences with variables such as temperature and social factors when designing exhibits."

Morphometric variation in the hominoid orbital aperture: a case study with implications for the use of variable characters in Miocene catarrhine systematics,"['Seiffert, ER', 'Kappelman, J']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.2000.0455,APR 2001,9,"Variable characters are ubiquitous in hominoid systematics and present a number of unique problems for phylogenetic analyses that include extinct taxa. As yet, however, few studies have quantified ranges of variation in complex morphometric characters within extant taxa and then used those data to assess the consistency with which discrete character states can be applied to poorly represented fossil species. In this study, ranges of intrageneric morphometric variation in the shape of the hominoid orbital aperture are estimated using exact randomization of average pairwise taxonomic distances (ATDs) derived from size-adjusted centroid, height-width, and elliptic Fourier (EF) variables. Using both centroid and height-width variables, 19 of the 21 possible ATDs between individuals representing seven extinct catarrhine taxa (Aegyptopithecus, Afropithecus, Ankarapithecus, Ouranopithecus, Paranthropus, Sivapithecus and Turkanapithecus) can be observed within a single extant hominoid subspecies, although generally with low probabilities. A resampling study is employed as a means for gauging the effect that this intrataxonomic variation may have on the consistency with which discrete orbital shape character states can be delimited given the small sample sizes available for most Miocene catarrhine taxa preserving this feature (i.e., n = 1). For each type of morphometric variable, 100 cluster (UPGMA) analyses of pairwise ATDs are performed in which a single individual is randomly selected from each hominoid genus and analyzed alongside known extinct taxa; consensus trees are computed in order to obtain the frequencies with which different shape clusters appeared in each of the three analyses. The two major clusters appearing most frequently in all three consensus trees are found in only 57% (centroid variables), 49% (height-width variables), and 36% (EF variables) of these trees. If ranges of variation within represented extinct taxa could also be estimated, these frequencies would certainly be far lower, Hominoids clearly exhibit considerable intrageneric, intraspecific, and even intrasubspecific Variation in orbit shape, and substantial morphometric overlap exists between taxa; consequently, discrete character states delimiting these patterns of continuous variation are likely to be highly unreliable in phylogenetic analyses of living and extinct species, particularly as the number of terminal taxa increases. Morphological phylogenetic studies of extant catarrhines that assess the effect of different methods (e.g., use of objective a priori weighting or frequency coding of variable characters, inclusion vs. exclusion of variable characters, use of specific vs, supraspecific terminal taxa) on phylogenetic accuracy may help to improve the techniques that systematists employ to make phylogenetic inferences about extinct taxa.

The prevalence of positive specimens was not related to the year of habituation of a gorilla group to humans. Campylobacter spp., Salmonella, and Shigella spp. infections were not distributed equally among the age classes of gorillas: most of the enteropathogens (80%), and all Shigella spp. organisms, S. sonnei, S. boydii, and S. flexneri, were isolated from subadults and adult gorillas with ages ranging from 6.0 to 11.9 yr. The prevalence of Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. infections among human-habituated gorillas has doubled during the last 4 yr, and isolation of Shigella spp. for the first time from mountain gorillas, may indicate enhanced anthropozoonotic transmission of these enteropathogens."

The assembly and cell surface expression of class I complexes depend on a continuous peptide supply. The peptides are generated mainly by the proteasome and are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum by a peptide transport pump consisting of two subunits, TAP1 and TAP2, The proteasome low molecular weight polypeptide (2 and 7), as well as TAP (1 and 2) genes, are coordinately regulated and are induced by IFNs, Despite this coordinate regulation, examination of tumors shows that these genes can be discordantly down-regulated, In pursuing a molecular explanation for these observations, we have characterized the mouse TAP2 promoter region and 5'-flanking sequence, We show that the 5' untranslated regions of TAP2 genes have a characteristic genomic organization that is conserved in both the mouse and the human, The mouse TAP2 promoter belongs to a class of promoters that lack TATA bares hut contain a MED1 (multiple start site element downstream) sequence. Accordingly, transcription is initiated from multiple sites within a 100-nucleotide window, An IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1)/IRF2 binding site is located in this region and is involved in both basal and IRF1-induced TAP2 promoter activity, The implication of the extensive differences found among the promoters of class I heavy chain, low molecular weight polypeptide, and TAP genes, all encoding proteins involved in Ag presentation, is discussed."

The density estimates were based on nest counts. The strip transect census and the line transect survey method (Standing Crop Nest Count) were used to estimate the gorilla nest group density. The strip transect has been most commonly used to date. It assumes that all nest groups within the width of the strip are detected, but as this assumption is easily violated in the dense tropical rain forest, the line transect survey was also used. In this method, only the nest groups on the transect line itself should be detected. This method proved to be an adequate and easy technique for estimating animal densities in dense vegetation. The gorilla density of 1.6 individuals km(-2) (line transect survey method) found for the Dzanga sector is one of the highest densities ever reported in the literature for the Western lowland gorilla. The density estimate for chimpanzees was 0.16 individuals km(-2) (census method). The results of this study confirm the importance of the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park for primate conservation."

Several nonhuman primates, including gorillas, develop signs of SpAs indistinguishable from clinical signs of humans with SpAs, To determine whether SpAs in gorillas have a similar HLA-B27-related etiology, we analyzed the MHC class I molecules expressed in four affected gorillas. Gogo-B01, isolated from three of the animals, has only limited similarity to HLA-B27 at the end of the al domain. It differs by several residues in the B pocket, including differences at positions 45 and 67, However, the molecular model of Gogo-B*0101 is consistent with a requirement for positively charged residues at the second amino acid of peptides bound by the MHC class I molecule. Indeed, the peptide binding motif and sequence of individual ligands eluted from Gogo-B*0101 demonstrate that, like HLA-B27, this gorilla MHC class I molecule binds peptides with arginine at the second amino acid position of peptides bound by the MHC class I molecule. Furthermore, live cell binding assays show that Gogo-B*0101 can bind HLA-B27 ligands, Therefore, although most gorillas that develop SpAs express an RMC class I molecule with striking differences to HLA-B27, this molecule binds peptides similar to those bound by HLA-B27."

These estimates, which were confirmed by additional data from GenBank, are substantially lower than previous ones, which included repetitive sequences and might have been based on less-accurate sequence data. The average sequence divergences between orangutans and humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas were 3.08% +/- 0.11%, 3.12% +/- 0.11%, and 3.09% +/- 0.11%, respectively, which also are substantially lower than previous estimates. The sequence divergences in other regions between hominoids were estimated from extensive data in GenBank and the literature, and Alus showed the highest divergence, followed in order by Y-linked noncoding regions, pseudogenes, autosomal intergenic regions, X-linked noncoding regions, synonymous sites, introns, and nonsynonymous sites. The neighbor-joining tree derived from the concatenated sequence of the 53 segments-24,234 bp in length-supports the Homo-Pan clade with a 100% bootstrap value. However, when each segment is analyzed separately, 22 of the 53 segments (similar to 42%) give a tree that is incongruent with the species tree, suggesting a large effective population size (Ne) of the common ancestor of Homo and Pan. Indeed, a parsimony analysis of the 53 segments and 37 protein-coding genes leads to an estimate of N-e = 52,000 to 96,000. As this estimate is 5 to 9 times larger than the long-term effective population size of humans (similar to 10,000) estimated from various genetic polymorphism data, the human lineage apparently had experienced a large reduction in effective population size after its separation from the chimpanzee lineage. Our analysis assumes a molecular clock, which is in fact supported by the sequence data used. Taking the orangutan speciation date as 12 to 16 million years ago, we obtain an estimate of 4.6 to 6.2 million years for the Homo-Pan divergence and an estimate of 6.2 to 8.4 million years for the gorilla speciation date, suggesting that the gorilla lineage branched off 1.6 to 2.2 million years earlier than did the human-chimpanzee divergence."
Attempts to detect retrotransposition and de novo deletion of Alus and other dispersed repeats at specific loci in the human genome,"['Hollies, CR', 'Monckton, DG', 'Jeffreys, AJ']",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS,10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200590,FEB 2001,9,"Dispersed repeat elements contribute to genome instability by de novo insertion and unequal recombination between repeats. To study the dynamics of these processes, we have developed single DNA molecule approaches to detect de novo insertions at a single locus and Alu-mediated deletions at two different loci in human genomic DNA. Validation experiments showed these approaches could detect insertions and deletions at frequencies below 10(-6) per cell. However, bulk analysis of germline (sperm) and somatic DNA showed no evidence for genuine mutant molecules, placing an upper limit of insertion and deletion rates of 2 x 10(-7) and 3 x 10(-7), respectively, in the individuals tested. Such re-arrangements at these loci therefore occur at a rate lower than that detectable by the most sensitive methods currently available."
Two function copies of the DGCR6 gene are present on human chromosome 22q11 due to a duplication of an ancestral locus,"['Edelmann, L', 'Stankiewicz, P', 'Spiteri, E', 'Pandita, RK', 'Shaffer, L', 'Lupski, J', 'Morrow, BE']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.GR-1431R,FEB 2001,21,"The DCCR6 (DiGeorge critical region) gene encodes a putative protein with sequence similarity to gonadal (gdl), a Drosophila melanogaster gene of unknown Function. We mapped the DGCR6 gene to chromosome 22q11 within a low copy repeat, termed sc11.1a, and identified a second copy of the gene, DGCR6L, within the duplicate locus, termed sc11.1b. Both sc11.1 repeats are deleted in most persons with velo-cardio-facial syndrome/DiGeorge syndrome (VCFS/DGS), and they map immediately adjacent and internal to the low copy repeats, termed LCR22, that mediate the deletions associated with VCFS/DGS. We sequenced genomic clones from both loci and determined that the putative initiator methionine is located further upstream than originally described, but in a position similar to the mouse and chicken orthologs. DGCR6L encodes a highly homologous, functional copy of DGCR6, with some base changes rendering amino acid differences. Expression studies of the two genes indicate that both genes are widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues. Evolutionary studies using FISH mapping in several different species of ape combined with sequence analysis of DGCR6 in a number of different primate species indicate that the duplication is at least 12 million years old and may date back to before the divergence of Catarrhines from Platyrrhines, 35 mya. These data suggest that there has been selective evolutionary pressure toward the Functional maintenance of both paralogs.

Comparison with control (uneaten) soils from the same areas showed lower levels of carbon and nitrogen in the eaten soils, a relationship confirmed by surface analysis. Surface analysis also revealed lower levels of iron on particle surfaces versus interiors. and higher levels of iron on ingested versus control soil particle surfaces. The soils can adsorb dietary toxins, present in the plant diet or those produced by microorganisms. Taking the toxic alkaloids quinine. atropine, sparteine, and lupanine as examples, it is evident that soils from Mahale have a very good adsorptive capacity. A new adaptive advantage of geophagy is proposed, based on the prevention of iron uptake. The behavior of the soils in vitro is consistent with the theory that geophagy has a therapeutic value for these chimpanzees."
Factors influencing the formation of ground nests by eastern lowland gorillas in Kahuzi-Biega National Park: some evolutionary implications of nesting behavior,"['Yamagiwa, J']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.2000.0444,FEB 2001,21,"To analyze the factors influencing nesting by gorillas on the ground, three kinds of data were collected in the Kahuzi-Biega National Park: from a single group for 3 years, from 25 groups during a population census, and from a habituated group before and after two social events. The data on the proportion of ground nests built by the single group for 3 years show no significant differences between rainy and dry seasons. Significant differences were found between some vegetation types: in particular, between bamboo forest and others (primary and secondary forests). However, these differences were not prominent or consistent across age-sex classes of gorillas. By contrast, large differences were found in this proportion between adults and immatures in both primary and secondary forests. The low proportion of ground nests built by immatures indicates their vulnerability. The present study suggests that the proportion was not influenced by group size but strongly influenced by the presence or absence of a leading silverback. Data on a habituated group that lost its leading male and acquired a new male after several months clearly show that females and immatures preferred sleeping in trees in the absence of a protector male. Immatures drastically decreased terrestrial nesting (from 54% to 6%, P<0.001) and increased it (from 6% to 19%, P>0.05) less dramatically than females did (from 24% to 60%, P<0.01) after immigration of the new male. These results suggest that vulnerability of female and immature gorillas to predators, in spite of their large body size. Small body size and considerable sexual dimorphism in early hominids implies their frequent use of tree nests and the importance of the male's role as protector. (C) 2001 Academic Press."
The geographic distribution of monoamine oxidase haplotypes supports a bottleneck during the dispersion of modern humans from Africa,"['Balciuniene, J', 'Syvanen, AC', 'McLeod, HL', 'Pettersson, U', 'Jazin, EE']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,NA,FEB 2001,14,"Every genetic locus mingles the information about the evolutionary history of the human species with the history of its own evolution. Therefore, to address the question of the origin of humans from a genetic point of view, evolutionary histories from many genetic loci have to be gathered and compared. We have studied two genes residing on the X chromosome encoding monoamine oxidases A and B (MAOA and MAOB). Both genes have been suggested to play a role in psychiatric and/or behavioral traits. To search for DNA variants of the MAO genes, the sequences of exonic and flanking intronic regions of these two genes were determined in a group of Swedish males. The sequence analysis revealed several novel polymorphisms in the MAO genes. Haplotypes containing high-frequency MAOA polymorphisms were constructed, and their Frequencies were determined in additional samples from Caucasian, Asian, and African populations. We found two common haplotypes with similar frequencies in Caucasian and Asian populations. However, only one of them was also the most frequent haplotype in Africans, while the other haplotype was present in only one Kenyan male. This profound change in haplotype frequencies from Africans to non-Africans supports a possible bottleneck during the dispersion of modern humans from Africa."
Global patterns of human DNA sequence variation in a 10-kb region on chromosome 1,"['Yu, N', 'Fu, YX', 'Sambuughin, N', 'Ramsay, M', 'Jenkins, T', 'Leskinen, E', 'Patthy, L', 'Jorde, LB', 'Kuromori, T', 'Li, WH']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,FEB 2001,100,"Human DNA variation is currently a subject of intense research because of its importance for studying human origins, evolution, and demographic history and for association studies of complex diseases. A similar to 10-kb region on chromosome 1, which contains only four small exons (each <155 bp), was sequenced for 61 humans (20 Africans, 20 Asians, and 21 Europeans) and for 1 chimpanzee, 1 gorilla, and 1 orangutan. We found 52 polymorphic sites among the 122 human sequences and 382 variant sites among the human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan sequences. For the introns sequenced (8,991 bp), the nucleotide diversity (<pi>) was 0.058% among all sequences, 0.076% among the African sequences, 0.047% among the Asian sequences, and 0.045% among the European sequences. A compilation of data revealed that autosomal regions have, on average, the highest rr value (0.091%), X-linked regions have a somewhat lower pi value (0.079%), and Y-linked regions have a very low pi value (0.008%). The lower polymorphism in the present region may be due to a lower mutation rate and/or selection in the gene containing these introns or in genes linked to this region. The present region and two other 10-kb noncoding regions all show a strong excess of low-frequency variants, indicating a relatively recent population expansion. This region has a low mutation rate, which was estimated to be 0.74 x 10(-9) per nucleotide per year. An average estimate of similar to 12,600 for the long-term effective population size was obtained using various methods; the estimate was not far from the commonly used value of 10,000. Fu and Li's tests rejected the assumption of an equilibrium neutral Wright-Fisher population, largely owing to the high proportion of low-frequency variants. The age of the most recent common ancestor of the sequences in our sample was estimated to be more than 1 Myr. Allowing for some unrealistic assumptions in the model, this estimate would still suggest an age of more than 500,000 years, providing further evidence for a genetic history of humans much more ancient than the emergence of modern humans. The fact that many unique variants exist in Europe and Asia also suggests a fairly long genetic history outside of Africa and argues against a complete replacement of all indigenous populations in Europe and Asia by a small Africa stock. Moreover, the ancient genetic history of humans indicates no severe bottleneck during the evolution of humans in the last half million years; otherwise, much of the ancient genetic history would have been lost during a severe bottleneck. We suggest that both the ""Out of Africa"" and the multiregional models are too simple to explain the evolution of modern humans."

Cloning and sequencing of gorilla-specific DNA sequences indicate that there are repetitive elements. Gorilla-specific DNA sequences were mapped by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) to the subcentromeric/centromeric regions of three pairs of gorilla submetacentric chromosomes. These sequences could represent either ancient sequences that got lost in other species, such as human and orang-utan, or, more likely, recent sequences which evolved or originated specifically in the gorilla genome."
Heterochronies and procrustes superimposition: application to the skulls of primates Hominoidea.,"['Penin, X', 'Berge, C']",COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES SERIE III-SCIENCES DE LA VIE-LIFE SCIENCES,10.1016/S0764-4469(00)01260-9,JAN 2001,13,"The procrustes superimposition method is well adapted to heterochronic studies in the field of evolutionary biology. 1) The procrustes method gives a precise and mathematical definition of two of the three heterochronic variables: size and shape. 2) It allows us to describe complex anatomical structures and thus to analyse the whole structure and not just to proceed trait by trait. 3) The approach is statistical and the different hypotheses and results may be statistically tested. 4) When applied to heterochronies the method allows us to test if there is a common shape change related to allometry. In the present study of three species of Hominoid primates, the procrustes superimposition reveals that various heterochronic processes are simultaneously present. Size-age-shape dissociations between species, already present in the first ontogenetic stage, are amplified with growth until adult stage. As compared with that of the chimpanzee, the growth of the gorilla skull is accelerated in terms of size-shape covariation and size alone. The growth of the human skull is neotenic as compared with that of the apes. (C) 2001 Academie des sciences/Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS."

Large-scale genotyping of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla DNAs revealed the homozygous presence of the phi hHaA nonsense mutation in humans of different ethnic backgrounds, but its absence in the functional orthologous chimpanzee (cHaA) and gorilla (gHaA) genes. Expression analyses of the encoded cHaA and gHaA hair keratins served to highlight dramatic differences between the hair keratin phenotypes of contemporary humans and the great apes. The relative numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions in the phi hHaA and cHaA genes, as inferred by using the gHaA gene as an outgroup, suggest that the human hHaA gene was inactivated only recently, viz., less than 240,000 years ago. This implies that the hair keratin phenotype of hominids prior to this date, and after the Pan-Homo divergence some 5.5 million years ago, could have been identical to that of the great apes. In addition, the homozygous presence of the phi hHaA exon 4 nonsense mutation in some of the earliest branching lineages among extant human populations lends strong support to the ""single African origin"" hypothesis of modern humans."

Saving the gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan t. troglodytes) of the Congo Basin,"['Tutin, CEG']",REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT,10.1071/RD01092,2001,8,"The forests of the Congo Basin in equatorial Africa are home to significant populations of gorillas and chimpanzees. However, numbers are declining owing to hunting and to alteration of their habitat. Gorillas and chimpanzees are particularly vulnerable for biological reasons: slow reproduction, prolonged developmental periods and complex social behaviour. In addition, their capacity to recover from disturbance is limited and the reinforcement of wild populations with captive-born individuals is rarely an option. Compared with the critically endangered mountain gorillas and the beleaguered chimpanzees in forest fragments in West Africa, there are some reasons for optimism about the future of the Congo Basin apes: levels of threat remain relatively low; and conservation of tropical rainforests has become a priority of the international community. At the same time, knowledge of the ecological needs of wild apes has increased and non-invasive techniques now exist to monitor population health. Sadly, no animals remain truly 'wild', as their survival depends to a greater or lesser extent on management. Protected areas and laws that forbid hunting of vulnerable species are classic tools of management, but broader landscape visions are now emerging that may allow the Congo Basin to avoid the fragile scenario of larger animals persisting only in 'island' parks."
A preliminary behavioral comparison of two captive all-male gorilla groups,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Hoff, MP', 'Lukas, KE', 'Maple, TL']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.1003,2001,14,"Gorillas live in polygamous harem groups, generally composed of one male, several adult females, and their offspring. With an equal numbers of male and female gorillas born in captivity, however, housing gorillas in social breeding units inevitably means that some males will not have access to female social partners. Thus, the future of the captive gorilla population depends on the collective ability of toes to house equal numbers of males and females. This study examined the behavioral profiles of two all-male groups of captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) to provide information on this type of housing situation. One group consisted of three subadult individuals, while the other consisted of two subadults and a silverback. Data were collected during two 6-month intervals, for a total of 284 hr. The behavioral profiles of the animals were stable over the course of the study but proximity patterns changed. Differences in feeding, solitary play, and object-directed behavior were found between groups, while no significant differences were observed in affiliative or agonistic social behavior. At both institutions, group cohesion appeared to be high, particularly between subadults; these individuals spent approximately 10% of their time engaging in social behavior and 25-50% of their time in close proximity (within 5 m). However, the Zoo Atlanta males spent significantly more time within 1 m and 5 m of each other than the Santa Barbara males, which may reflect a higher level of cohesiveness among members of the Zoo Atlanta group. The behavioral profiles of the animals in this study were similar to those found in bachelor groups of wild mountain gorillas. One notable exception was the absence of homosexual behavior between the silverback and subadults in Santa Barbara and the low frequency of this behavior between subadults in both groups. Although more longitudinal data are needed, these data suggest that all-male groups can be a feasible housing strategy for males at certain periods of their life span. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

The resulting two-dimensional representations clearly show that in samples taken during this 2.5-year period, the silverback male was surrounded by five adult females, while three infant or young juvenile females, gathered in a body, remained between the silverback male and adult females. Some adult females maintained proximity to the silverback male more frequently than other adult females throughout the five periods. Unlike mountain gorillas in the wild, females with dependent offspring did not tend to stay near the silverback male more frequently than other females, and related females did not tend to spend more time near each other than non-related females. Three older juvenile or young adult males were plotted the furthest from the silverback male, with gradual changes with increasing age. The usefulness of the MDS procedure, which can be used to visualize easily and clearly the social relationships among individuals, is discussed from the viewpoint of the management of breeding groups of captive gorillas.

Managing the socialization of an adult male gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) with a history of social deprivation,"['Burks, KD', 'Bloomsmith, MA', 'Forthman, DL', 'Maple, TL']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.1033,2001,7,"Most non-human primates exhibit aggression during changes in social group composition. In zoological parks, group membership changes are necessary for optimal population management, but can elicit problematic aggression. Furthermore, some primates with a long history of social deprivation are hyperaggressive when introduced to conspecifics. In this study of one male gorilla with a 30-year history of social deprivation, we assessed the rate of aggression quantitatively during a four-step socialization procedure. We hypothesized that 1) the frequency of agonistic/display behaviors would increase markedly at the beginning of each phase of the socialization, then decline to baseline levels over time in each phase and 2) the frequency of affiliative behaviors would not vary systematically within or between phases of socialization. Our results largely supported these predictions, and we found the four-step socialization process effective in managing aggression in this case. In addition to documenting the successful socialization of a socially deprived adult male gorilla, we believe that the empirical process used in this case argues for scientific management of other introductions.

This paper reports on the status of large mammals within the mountain sector of the park in 1996, 2 years after the arrival of half a million Rwandan refugees in the area immediately adjacent to the sector. Large mammal surveys found that gorilla populations had remained stable and that elephants were concentrated within a subsector of the area, However, although chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis), and owl-faced monkeys (C. hamlyni) were abundant and widespread, most terrestrial mammal species were found in very low densities and had been subjected to poaching. Nevertheless, important mammal populations remained and complemented the biodiversity conservation value of the park."
Isolation of markers from recently transposed LINE-1 retrotransposons,"['Cantrell, MA', 'Grahn, RA', 'Scott, L', 'Wichman, HA']",BIOTECHNIQUES,NA,DEC 2000,12,"Many previous techniques for the isolation of endogenous retroelements such as LINE-I retrotransposons have produced major sampling bias or required laborious procedures. These problems led to the isolation of only older elements in some cases. In other cases, specialized systems there required for the isolation of recently transposed elements. We report here a system for the easy isolation of markers from a wide range of LINE-1 elements and the screening of recently transposed elements from that population. This is accomplished by the use of PCR with degenerate primers specific for conserved regions of the reverse transcriptase gene, a modified screening vector and a refined blue/white colony assay that screens for amplified DNA containing open reading frames This method should be applicable to searches for endogenous retroviruses."
Conservation in decay accelerating factor (DAF) structure among primates,"['Kuttner-Kondo, L', 'Subramanian, VB', 'Atkinson, JP', 'Yu, JL', 'Medof, ME']",DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY,10.1016/S0145-305X(00)00026-4,DEC 2000,8,"The decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) protects self cells from activation of autologous complement on their surfaces, It functions to disable the C3 convertases, the central amplification enzymes of the cascade, Its active site(s) are contained within four similar to 60 amino acid long units, termed complement control protein repeats (CCPs). which are suspended above the cell surface on a 68 amino acid long serine/threonine (S/T)-rich cushion that derives from three exons. We previously proposed a molecular model of human DAF's four CCPs in which certain amino acids were postulated to be recognition sites for the interaction between DAF and the C3 convertases. In the current study, wt characterized DAF in five non-human primates: the great apes, gorilla and common chimpanzee, and the Old World monkeys: hamadryas baboon, Rhesus macaque, and patas monkey. Amino acid homology to human DAF was approximately 98% for the two great apes and 83% for the three Old World monkeys. The above cited putative ligand interactive residues were found to be fully conserved in all of the non-human primates, although there were amino acid changes outside of these areas, In the chimpanzee, alternative splicing of the S/T region was Found potentially to be the source of multiple protein isoforms in erythrocytes, whereas in the patas monkey, similar alternative splicing was observed but only one protein band was seen. Interestingly, a Rhesus macaque was found to exhibit a phenomenon paralleling the human Cromer Dr(a-) blood group, in which a 44-base pair deletion in CCP3 leads to a frameshift and early STOP codon.

Management of reactive arthritis in a juvenile gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) with long-term sulfasalazine therapy,"['Neiffer, DL', 'Rothschild, BM', 'Marks, SK', 'Urvater, JA', 'Watkins, DI']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,DEC 2000,9,"A juvenile western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) experienced recurrent fever, lethargy, diarrhea, and/or arthritis starting at age 6 mo. During an episode at age 15 mo, Shigella sp. was isolated from diarrheic feces. At age 41 mo, reactive arthritis was diagnosed. In addition, the gorilla's growth was retarded. All arthritic attacks were managed symptomatically prior to age 4 yr, at which time a severe episode precipitated the implementation of therapy with sulfasalazine, an arthritis suppressive medication. Examination 27 mo later revealed cessation of progressive joint pathology although the animal exhibited decreased range of motion in most joints. The gorilla has been on sulfasalazine therapy for 4 yr without lameness. Growth has resumed, and there has been no radiographic evidence of progressive joint degeneration. Immunogenetic analysis of whole blood obtained at age 68 mo identified the gorilla major histocompatibility class I allele, Gogo-B*0101, which has limited nucleotide sequence similarity to HLA-B27, an allele associated with postinfection reactive arthritis in humans. Sulfasalazine therapy effectively managed reactive arthritis in this gorilla and should be considered for similarly frequently affected animals. Juvenile gorillas, in populations with a history of clinical shigellosis and/or postdiarrhea arthritis, may benefit from prophylactic sulfasalazine therapy after episodes of bacterial enterocolitis. Sulfasalazine therapy should be considered in all gorillas, juvenile and adult, experiencing confirmed Shigella sp.-associated enterocolitis."

The five exons of the gene were sequenced in three gorillas and in a normally pigmented human. The tyrosinase gene has been found to he a very conserved locus with a very low substitution rate. Some nucleotide and amino acid differences were found between the gorilla and human tyrosinase coding sequences. One of the gorillas included in the study is the only known case of albinism in a gorilla ('Snowflake'). Mutations of the TYR gene lead to Oculocutaneous Albinism type 1 (OCA1), the most common type of albinism in humans (OMIM accession number 203100), The TYR gene encodes the tyrosinase enzyme (E.C. 1.14.18.1), whose activity was found to be completely lacking in 'Snowflake', indicating that a mutation in the Tyr gene is the likely cause of his albinism, Nonetheless, no nucleotide changes were detected that could account for the lack of Tyr product or tyrosinase activity in Snowflake, and explanations of these findings are discussed."

Integrated analysis of sequence evolution and population history using hypervariable compound haplotypes,"['Rogers, EJ', 'Shone, AC', 'Alonso, S', 'May, CA', 'Armour, JAL']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/9.18.2675,NOV 1 2000,11,"We have examined compound haplotypes from a highly informative region of human chromosome 16, in which information from the rapid evolution of a highly unstable minisatellite is integrated with data on the longer-term evolution of this segment from 10 flanking substitutional polymorphisms, Combined with sequence data from non-human primates, analysis of relationships between these compound haplotypes allows the reconstruction of a rooted network of the evolutionary pathways between them, Most relationships can be explained via simple substitutional mutations, although the origins of some haplotypes involve recurrent events at a hotspot for substitutional mutation and/or gene conversion. For compound haplotypes including the minisatellite array, the network found in a range of world-wide populations constitutes a highly informative data set for the analysis of population history (437 different compound haplotypes were discriminated among 658 studied). Since the mutation rates and processes of the minisatellite array are known from direct studies, ages for individual lineages have been estimated using associated minisatellite diversity, These analyses suggest that the higher information content and sampling depth of these compound haplotypes may allow more precise calibration of lineage ages than is possible using coalescent analysis of DNA sequence. Using this method we have dated the oldest Eurasian lineage as 52 000-66 000 years and the oldest European specific lineage as 37 600-56 200 years."
Effects of environmental change on emerging parasitic diseases,"['Patz, JA', 'Graczyk, TK', 'Geller, N', 'Vittor, AY']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/S0020-7519(00)00141-7,NOV 2000,357,"Ecological disturbances exert an influence on the emergence and proliferation of malaria and zoonotic parasitic diseases, including, Leishmaniasis, cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, trypanosomiasis, schistosomiasis, filariasis, onchocerciasis, and loiasis. Each environmental change, whether occurring as a natural phenomenon or through human intervention, changes the ecological balance and context within which disease hosts or vectors and parasites breed, develop, and transmit disease. Each species occupies a particular ecological niche and vector species sub-populations are distinct behaviourally and genetically as they adapt to man-made environments. Most zoonotic parasites display three distinct life cycles: sylvatic, zoonotic, and anthroponotic. In adapting to changed environmental conditions, including reduced non human population and increased human population, some vectors display conversion from a primarily zoophyllic to primarily anthrophyllic orientation. Deforestation and ensuing changes in landuse, human settlement, commercial development, road construction, water control systems (dams, canals, irrigation systems, reservoirs), and climate, singly, and in combination have been accompanied by global increases in morbidity and mortality from emergent parasitic disease. The replacement of forests with crop farming, ranching, and raising small animals can create supportive habitats for parasites and their host vectors. When the landuse of deforested areas changes, the pattern of human settlement is altered and habitat fragmentation may provide opportunities for exchange and transmission of parasites to the heretofore uninfected humans. Construction of water control projects can lead to shifts in such vector populations as snails and mosquitoes and their parasites. Construction of roads in previously inaccessible forested areas can lead to erosion, and stagnant ponds by blocking the Row of streams when the water rises during the rainy season. The combined effects of environmentally detrimental changes in local landuse and alterations in global climate disrupt the natural ecosystem and can increase the risk of transmission of parasitic diseases to the human population.

Evolution of the X-linked zinc finger gene and the Y-linked zinc finger gene in primates,"['Kim, HS', 'Takenaka, O']",MOLECULES AND CELLS,NA,OCT 31 2000,3,"We have sequenced the partial exon of the zinc finger genes (ZFX and ZFY) in 5 hominoids, 2 Old World monkeys, 1 New World monkey, and 1 prosimian, Among these primate species, the percentage similarities of the nucleotide sequence of the ZFX gene were 96-100% and 91.2-99.7% for the ZFY gene, Of 397 sites in the ZFX and ZFY gene sequences, 20 for ZFX gene and 42 for ZFY gene were found to be variable. Substitution causes 1 amino acid change in ZFX, and 5 in ZFY, among 132 amino acids. The numbers of synonymous substitutions per site (Ks) between human and the chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan for ZFY gene were 0.026, 0.033, and 0.085, respectively. In contrast, the Iis value between human and hominoid primates for the ZFX gene was 0.008 for each comparison. Comparison of the ZFX and ZFY genes revealed that the synonymous substitution levels were higher in hominoids than in other primates, The rates of synonymous substitution per site per year were higher in the ZFY exon than in the SRY exon, and higher in the ZFY exon than in the ZFY intron, in hominoid primates."
The implications of intergenic polymorphism for major histocompatibility complex evolution,"[""O'hUigin, C"", 'Satta, Y', 'Hausmann, A', 'Dawkins, RL', 'Klein, J']",GENETICS,NA,OCT 2000,21,"A systematic survey of six intergenic regions flanking the human HLA-B locus in eight haplotypes reveals the regions to be up to 20 times more polymorphic than the reported average degree of human neutral polymorphism. Furthermore, the extent of polymorphism is directly related to the proximity to the HLA-B locus. Apparently linkage to HLA-B locus alleles, which are under balancing selection, maintains the neutral polymorphism of adjacent regions. For these linked polymorphisms to persist, recombination in the 200-kb interval from HLA-B to TNF must occur at a low frequency. The high degree of polymorphism found distal to HLA-B suggests that recombination is uncommon on both sides of the HLA-B locus. The least-squares estimate is 0.15% per megabase with an estimated range from 0.02 to 0.54%. These findings place strong restrictions on possible recombinational mechanisms for the generation of diversity at the HLA-B."
Cytochrome c oxidase assembly in primates is sensitive to small evolutionary variations in amino acid sequence,"['Barrientos, A', 'Muller, S', 'Dey, R', 'Wienberg, J', 'Moraes, CT']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,OCT 2000,36,"Respiring mitochondria require many interactions between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from the gorilla and the chimpanzee are able to restore oxidative phosphorylation in a human cell, mtDNAs from more distant primate species are functionally incompatible with human nuclear genes. Using microcell-mediated chromosome and mitochondria transfer, we introduced and maintained a functional orangutan mtDNA in a human nuclear background. However, partial oxidative phosphorylation function was restored only in the presence of most orangutan chromosomes, suggesting that human oxidative phosphorylation-related nuclear-coded genes are not able to replace many orangutan ones. The respiratory capacity of these hybrids was decreased by 65%-80%, and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity was decreased by 85%-95%. The function of other respiratory complexes was not significantly altered. The translation of mtDNA-coded COX subunits was normal, but their steady-state levels were similar to 10% of normal ones. Nuclear-coded COX subunits were loosely associated with mitochondrial membranes, a characteristic of COX assembly-defective mutants. Our results suggest that many human nuclear-coded genes not only cannot replace the orangutan counterparts, but also exert a specific interference at the level of COX assembly. This cellular model underscores the precision of COX assembly in mammals and sheds light on the nature of nuclear-mtDNA coevolutionary constraints."

Progressive inactivation of the haploid expressed gene for the sperm-specific endozepine-like peptide (ELP) through primate evolution,"['Ivell, R', 'Pusch, W', 'Balvers, M', 'Valentin, M', 'Walther, N', 'Weinbauer, G']",GENE,10.1016/S0378-1119(00)00317-6,SEP 19 2000,9,"The endozepine-like peptide (ELP) is a novel intracellular molecule which is expressed in high amounts at both mRNA and protein levels very specifically in late haploid male germ cells. It is closely related to the ubiquitous acyl-CoA binding protein, is highly conserved, shares a similar ability to bind mid-long chain acyl-CoA, and is thus likely to be involved in mature sperm metabolism While it has been characterized from diverse mammals, it has so far not been possible to identify an equivalent molecule in the primate testis. Using a PCR approach, combined with cDNA cloning and Northern hybridization, testicular transcripts and/or genomic DNA were analysed for different primate species, including human. In the marmoset and cynomolgus macaque normally structured transcripts appear to be expressed, though at a low level. In the human testis, two ran transcripts were characterized, hELP1 and hELP2, the products of independent duplicated genes. Both transcripts were longer than in nonmammalian species, included frame-shift mutations and substantial sequence insertions, preventing the translation of a sensible protein. Genomic PCR analysis of three anthropoid species, chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan, showed the presence of a similarly mutated hELP1 gene. Only in the gorilla was a hELP2 gene identified, apparently lacking the Frame-shift mutation, and thus potentially able to give rise to a functional ELF protein. Taken together, these results show that during primate evolution there has been a progressive inactivation of the ELF gene, initially with a down-regulation in lower primates, and subsequently with inactivating mutations in the open reading frame. At some time during simian evolution prior to these mutations there has been a gene duplication, though this second gene has also become inactivated in humans. In its pattern of evolution the ELF gene shows similarities with the MDC/fertilin family, whose members are also considered essential components of haploid sperm in non-primates, but which are progressively inactivated in anthropoids and humans. We should like to speculate that the established subfertility of the human male may not be a recent event, but the consequence of a longer evolutionary process whereby primates have traded off absolute fertility against social or sexual advantages.

A total of 142 fragments were sequenced, and the counterpart sequences were also determined in non-human primates. In humans, 10 different alleles were found; they could be grouped into seven allelic classes based on the total number of repeats. No variation was observed in the alleles 17, 18 and 19, which showed consensus sequence structures and in the allele 14, which showed a different structure. New variation was found in alleles 15, 16, and 20, which had differences occurred in a basic (TCTA)(TCTG)(n) repeat in the 5' side. The counterpart fragments were successfully amplified in three species (chimpanzees, gorilla, and orangutan) out of four kinds of anthropoids, three species (rhesus macaques, Japanese macaques, and green monkey) out of four kinds of old world monkeys, but not in one species of either new world monkey or prosimian. The sizes of the fragments distributed from 92 to 180 bp in non-human primates and showed allelic size differences in four species. The sequence of the 5' flanking region followed by primer sequences in humans and anthropoids, which consisted of 19 bp, was identical in all, but differed from that in old world monkeys. The basic repeat motifs of humans and anthropoids consisted of TCTA, TCTG, and TCCA but that of old world monkeys consisted of TCTG, TCCG and TCCA The structures of humans and anthropoids were essentially similar, but with characteristic difference in each species. Differences in the allelic structures of old world monkeys were complex. Seven different alleles were observed in two rhesus and two Japanese macaques and one type of allele was observed in two green monkeys, Duplication of more than two repeat units of 4 bp was found in an allele of an old world monkey.

Body mass in lowland gorillas: A quantitative analysis,"['Zihlman, AL', 'McFarland, RK']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/1096-8644(200009)113:1<61::AID-AJPA6>3.0.CO;2-H,SEP 2000,28,"Body proportions and tissue composition (e.g., relative contributions of muscle, skin, bone, and adipose to total body mass) were determined through dissection of four adult captive lowland gorillas. The relative contribution of bone varies little among the four animals (10.2-13.4%) despite considerable range in body weights (99.5-211 kg). In tissue composition, three animals have on average 37.3% muscle relative to body mass. Maximum estimates of body fat range between 19.4-44%. Differences in age, sex, and life history events partially explain the observed variation in body proportions and tissue composition among the four animals. Although gorillas are considered extremely sexually dimorphic in body weight and canine size, differences in tissue are not as dramatic as body mass differences suggest. This study found sex differences mostly in the upper body; males have relatively heavier forelimbs, including heavier deltoid, trunk-binding, and deep back muscles compared to the younger female. The old, obese female had one half the muscle tissue of the other three animals (16% vs. 37.3%), and twice the body fat (44%); forelimbs and upper body musculature were relatively well-developed to compensate for the restricted hip-joint movement due to arthritis. Data on the variation in tissue composition and body proportions in gorillas provide a basis for comparison with other hominoids, including humans. For example, compared to highly dimorphic orangutans, gorillas have more muscle, less adipose tissue, lighter forelimbs and heavier hindlimbs. Such analyses complement studies of the skeleton and contribute to our understanding of human evolution and adaptation. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Unexpectedly similar rates of nucleotide substitution found in male and female hominids,"['Bohossian, HB', 'Skaletsky, H', 'Page, DC']",NATURE,NA,AUG 10 2000,70,"In 1947, it was suggested that, in humans, the mutation rate is dramatically higher in the male germ line than in the female germ line(1). This hypothesis has been supported by the observation that, among primates, Y-linked genes evolved more rapidly than homologous X-linked genes(2-6). Based on these evolutionary studies, the ratio (alpha(m)) of male to female mutation rates in primates was estimated to be about 5. However, selection could have skewed sequence evolution in introns and exons(7-10). In addition, some of the X-Y gene pairs studied lie within chromosomal regions with substantially divergent nucleotide sequences(7,11,12). Here we directly compare human X and Y sequences within a large region with no known genes. Here the two chromosomes are 99% identical, and X-Y divergence began only three or four million years ago, during hominid evolution(13-15). In apes, homologous sequences exist only on the X chromosome. We sequenced and compared 38.6 kb of this region from human X, human Y, chimpanzee X and gorilla X chromosomes. We calculated alpha(m) to be 1.7 (95% confidence interval 1.15-2.87), significantly lower than previous estimates in primates. We infer that, in humans and their immediate ancestors, male and female mutation rates were far more similar than previously supposed."
Evolution of an Alu DNA element of type Sx in the lineage of primates and the origin of an associated tetranucleotide microsatellite,"['Crouau-Roy, B', 'Clisson, I']",GENOME,10.1139/gen-43-4-642,AUG 2000,4,"A 394-bp DNA fragment, which in human is on chromosome 6 near the MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) gene and encompasses an Alu element and an associated tetranucleotide microsatellite, was sequenced from a large range of primate species to follow its evolutionary divergence and to understand the origin of the microsatellite. This Alu element is found at the same orthologous position in all primates sequenced, but the tetranucleotide repeat is present only in Catarrhini between the 3'-oligo(dA) of the Alu element and the 3' flanking direct repeat. Little intraspecific variation was found. Sequence identity values for this orthologous primate Alu averaged 90% (82-99%) with transitions comprising between 70% and 100% of the observed nucleotide substitutions. Although the insertion of the Alu element predates the separation of these species, the original sequence of the site of integration can still be identified. This identification of the direct repeats suggests an active role of the oligo(dA) of the Alu element in the origin of the tetranucleotide repeats. The microsatellite probably appeared after the insertion of the Alu element, early in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of the hominoids and the Old World monkeys."
Degenerative joint disease in African great apes: an evolutionary perspective,"['Jurmain, R']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.2000.0413,AUG 2000,23,"Degenerative joint disease is investigated in the spine and major peripheral joints (shoulder, elbow, hip and knee) in samples of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii; P. troglodytes troglodytes), lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and bonobos (P. paniscus). The P. troglodytes schweinfurthii sample comes from Gombe National Park, Tanzania, while the other samples are derived from museum materials originally collected in west/central Africa. Total data for African ape samples include 5807 surfaces for ascertainment of vertebral osteophytosis, 12,479 surfaces for determination of spinal osteoarthritis, and 1211 joints for evaluation of peripheral joint osteoarthritis. All apes display significantly less spinal disease than in a comparable human sample, and these differences are most likely a consequence of human biomechanical adaptations for bipedal locomotion. Apes are also generally less involved in the major peripheral joints than are humans, but human groups are themselves highly variable in prevalence of peripheral osteoarthritis.

Infection of nonhuman primate cells by pig endogenous retrovirus,"['Blusch, JH', 'Patience, C', 'Takeuchi, Y', 'Templin, C', 'Roos, C', 'Von der Helm, K', 'Steinhoff, G', 'Martin, U']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.74.16.7687-7690.2000,AUG 2000,59,"The ongoing shortage of human donor organs for transplantation has catalyzed new interest in the application of pig organs (xenotransplantation). One of the biggest concerns about the transplantation of porcine grafts into humans is the transmission of pig endogenous retroviruses (PERV) to the recipients or even to other members of the community. Although nonhuman primate models are excellently suited to mimic clinical xenotransplantation settings, their value for risk assessment of PERV transmission at xenotransplantation is questionable since all of the primate cell lines tested so far have been found to be nonpermissive for PERV infection. Here we demonstrate that human, gorilla, and Papio hamadryas primary skin fibroblasts and also baboon B-cell lines are permissive for PERV infection. This suggests that a reevaluation of the suitability of the baboon model for risk assessment in xenotransplantation is critical at this point."
Reproductive monitoring of free-ranging female mountain gorillas by urinary hormone analysis,"['Czekala, N', 'Sicotte, P']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/1098-2345(200007)51:3<209::AID-AJP6>3.0.CO;2-6,JUL 2000,12,"Frequent urine samples from three habituated free-ranging adult female mountain gorillas were collected during a four-week period in order to characterize, by analysis of urinary hormones, their ovarian cycle, and to diagnose pregnancy. A conceptive cycle and two cycles that did not result in full term pregnancy were monitored. Behavioral and physiological observations of mating and labial swellings were correlated to urinary hormone results. Mating occurred on days with elevated estrogens. Labial swelling was maximum near or at peak estrogen levels. Pregnancy was diagnosed at the field site by measurement of chorionic gonadotropin using commercially available human pregnancy detection kits. In one pregnancy, gestation length was 254 days. The pregnanediol glucuronide concentrations of the mountain gorilla did not change during the nonconceptive cycle. During the conceptive cycle, the concentrations did not increase until the approximate time of implantation. This finding suggests marked differences in steroid production or metabolism between the mountain gorilla and the captive lowland gorilla. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Ecology and social organisation of African rainforest primates: relevance for understanding the transmission of retroviruses.,"['Tutin, CEG']",BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE DE PATHOLOGIE EXOTIQUE,NA,JUL 2000,10,"The risk of transmission of primate viruses to humans is great because of their genetic proximity. It is now clear that the HIV group of retroviruses came from primates and that the origin of HIV1 is the chimpanzee subspecies of Central Africa, Pan troglodytes troglodytes. Many African primates are natural hosts of retroviruses and details of the natural history of both hosts and viruses are essential to understand the evolution of the latter Data on the demography ecology and behaviour of three species of primates (gorillas, chimpanzees and mandrills), studied in the Lope Reserve in Central Gabon since 1983, are analysed to identify the factors that allow, or favour disease transmission within each species, between different species and between primates and humans. The comparison of the relative degree of risk suggests that of the three species, chimpanzees are the most susceptible to exposure to infection both from conspecifics and from other species. With respect to humans, the comparative analysis suggests greater exposure to viruses of mandrills and gorillas than to those of chimpanzees. For primates, major risk factors are: large social groups; bites inflicted in fights; social grooming; and predation on mammals. However given that contacts between social groups of the same species are rare, the spread of a virus through a population will be slow and uncertain. Hunting wild animals is the behaviour most likely to provide transmission routes for primate viruses into human populations because of the high probability of blood-blood contact. Not only the hunters themselves, but also women who prepare bush meat for cooking and people involved in trade of carcasses are at high risk of transmission of pathogens. Hunting of bush meat is increasing in Central Africa due to the economic recession and the spread of logging into the forests of the interior of the region. To counter the significant risk of transmission of known, as well as new, diseases from primates to humans, urgent measures are needed to attack the root causes of commercial hunting which is not only risk to public health but also a serious threat to biodiversity in the region."
Representing space and objects in monkeys and apes,"['Call, J']",COGNITIVE SCIENCE,NA,JUL-SEP 2000,23,"Primate foraging con be construed as a set of interconnected problems that include finding food, selecting efficient travel routes, anticipating the positions of moving prey, and manipulating, and occasionally, extracting food items using tools. The evidence reviewed in this paper strongly suggests that both monkeys and apes use three types of representation (i.e., static, dynamic, and relational) to solve various problems. Static representations involve recoiling certain features of the environment, dynamic representations involve imagining changes in the trajectories of moving objects, and relational representations involve encoding the properties of objects in relation to other objects. Contrary to previous claims, no clear differences were found between the representational skills of monkeys and apes. Current evidence also suggests that primates may be better at representing general compared to specific problem features. Finally, we have characterized the domains of space and objects as complementary and indicated future lines of research in these domains."

Skeletal evidence of probable treponemal infection in free-ranging African apes,"['Lovell, NC', 'Jurmain, R', 'Kilgore, L']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557597,JUL 2000,10,"The prevalence and patterning of inflammatory lesions of the skeleton were investigated in samples of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) curated at the Powell-Cotton Museum, Birchington, UK. One hundred and two chimpanzees (42 adults and 60 subadults) and 126 gorillas (50 adults and 76 subadults) comprise the samples. Twenty per cent of chimpanzees and 14% of gorillas were affected with a disseminated inflammatory skeletal condition caused by infection. The lesions appear to have originated as localized patches of new bone deposition on the surface of long bones and to have progressed to infection of the bone cortex and marrow. Although female prevalence of involvement exceeds that of males in both species, the differences are not statistically significant. The age distribution of affected animals indicates that the disease began in some animals as early as 2 yr of age. Given the skeletal and demographic prevalence and patterning of the lesions as well as the ecology and behavior of these animals, the most likely diagnosis of the condition is a yaws-like treponemal infection."
Structure analysis of CCR5 from human and primates,"['Yang, J', 'Zhang, YW', 'Huang, JF', 'Zhang, YP', 'Liu, CQ']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE-THEOCHEM,10.1016/S0166-1280(99)00393-0,JUN 26 2000,4,"It is well known that the chemokine receptor CCR5 plays very important roles in HIV-1 virus infection. A three-dimensional molecular model of human CCR5 was generated by SYBYL, a distance geometry-based homologous modeling package, using the corresponding transmembrane domain of bacteriorhodopsin as the template. On the basis of human CCR5 model, we also built 18 3D molecular models of CCR5 in primates from Pongo pygmaeus, Pygathrix nemaeus, Macaca assameniss, Trachy-pithecus phayrei, T. francoisi, M. arotoides, Rhinopithecus roxellance, R, bieti, R. avunculus, Hylobates leucogenys, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Cercopithecus aethiops 1, C. aethiops 2, Papio hamadryas M. mulatta, M. fascicularis and M. nemestrina. Structural analyses and statistics results suggested that the main-chains of the primate CCR5 were similar to that of the human CCR5 and that the fit-RMS deviation values of these primate CCR5 were less than 0.1 Angstrom. Moreover, the structures of these CCR5 proteins, except those of the African green monkey 1 (C.aet1), do not have a remarkable difference. It is proved that the 14th residue is possibly very important in the inhibition infections by M-tropic HIV-1, and it is also demonstrated that the 13th residue of human CCR5 was changed from asparagine into aspartic acid in all these primates. It means that the primate CCR5 no longer depend on CD4 for efficient entry, but human CCR5 may have evolved subsequently due to the use of CD4 as a receptor, allowing the high-affinity chemokine receptor-binding site of HIV to be sequestered from host immune surveillance.

Obstetric management of a protracted labor in a captive Western lowland gorilla,"['Cole, RE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY,10.1067/mob.2000.106185,JUN 2000,1,"This article discusses the cooperative efforts of a team of physicians and veterinarians resulting in the successful assisted vaginal delivery of a Western lowland gorilla at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle. Washington. A IO-year-old, captive-born female gorilla, gravida 3, para 0, aborta 2, was observed to be in labor at term after spontaneous rupture of membranes. After 36 hours of observation, she had not yet delivered her infant. A team of physicians and veterinarians intervened. After induction of general anesthesia. an assessment of fetal and maternal status was made. With ultrasonographic monitoring of fetal cardiac activity, labor was augmented with administration of intravenous oxytocin. A vaginal delivery was performed with a vacuum extractor, resulting in the birth of a viable, 2.4-kg female infant. The infant survived the neonatal period and was hand reared until she was successfully introduced to the gorilla troop at the age of 1 year. Although there are several cases of cesarean delivery in captive gorillas, this is the first reported use of labor augmentation and assisted vaginal delivery in this captive species. Captive breeding is the key to survival of the Western lowland gorilla. The collaborative work of physicians and veterinarians is an integral part of this successful program. It is reported that in the captive population approximately 30% of newborns die in the first year, with more than half of the deaths occurring just before birth or within the first day of life. This does not include early spontaneous pregnancy losses. With aggressive management of pregnancy and labor complications, it may be possible to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality in the captive gorilla population. Because gorillas are closely related to humans, with the only closer relative being the chimpanzee, it is probable that the basic principles of obstetric management in humans can be safely and appropriately applied to the captive gorilla population. With the exception of this report and the cited cesarean delivery reports, there are no other references to cross-species studies of active intervention in gorillas with human obstetric techniques. It is hoped that an increased awareness on the part of obstetricians of the importance of their knowledge and skill to toes will lead to more successful outcomes in the captive gorilla population."
Initial studies on the contributions of body size and gastrointestinal passage rates to dietary flexibility among gorillas,"['Remis, MJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(2000)112:2<171::AID-AJPA4>3.0.CO;2-F,JUN 2000,39,"Large body size has been traditionally seen as the primary dietary adaptation of gorillas, facilitating their consumption of fibrous foods (Schaller [1963] The Mountain Gorilla; Watts [1990] Int. J. Primatol. 11:21-45). Nevertheless, recent research has emphasized frugivory among western lowland gorillas, as well as the influence of habitat and seasonality on gorilla diet and behavior across subspecies (Watts [1990] Int. J. Primatol. 11:21-45; Tutin et al. [1991] Philos. R. Sec. Trans. Lend. Biol. 334:179-186; Remis [1994] Ph.D. Thesis, [1997a] Am. J. Primatol. 43:87-109, [1997b] Am. J.

Primatol. 20:1-23, [1999b] Nonhuman Primates, p 58-63). This study provides preliminary data to address the physiological underpinnings of dietary flexibility among gorillas, and their consumption of a broad range of fibrous and tannin-rich foods. To date, little is known about the digestive physiology of the African apes (but see Milton [1984] Adaptations for Foraging in Nonhuman Primates, p 249-279, Milton [1984][1999] Evol. Anthropol. 8:11-20; Milton and Demment [1988] J. Nutr. 118:1082-1088; Lambert [1997] Ph.D. Dissertation), although gastrointestinal morphology and proportions are roughly similar among species (Chivers and Hladik [1980] J. Morphol. 166:337-386). This study provides additional experimental data on the gastrointestinal passage times of gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) fed a captive diet in a zoological park setting and discusses results in relation to field research on gorilla feeding ecology. In this study, 480 small plastic markers were fed to six captive gorillas. The mean gut retention time (MRT) of the adult gorillas in this study was 50 hr, longer than the 31 hr reported for chimpanzees fed a similar diet (Lambert [1997] Ph.D. Dissertation). These data suggest that gorillas may retain foods in their gastrointestinal tracts longer than smaller hominoids, and that the large body size likely forms the primary basis for consumption of fiber. This research provides additional data to contribute to our understanding of the relationships of body size and morphology to ecology, and the evolution of body size, foraging strategy and social organization among the African apes.

The T-4 levels ranged from 20 to 132 nmol/L ((x) over bar +/- SD = 62.8 +/- 24.7 nmol/L). Levels of TSH were detected only in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and Sumatran orang-utans (Pongo pygmaeus abelii) (range, 0.4-10.8 mIU/L; detectable limit = 0.01 mIU/L). The results suggest that the antibodies used in the commercial TSH immunoassay assessed in this study cross-react with gorilla and orang-utan TSH but not with TSH of primates of the genera Macaca, Papio, Erythrocebus, Ateles, Leontopithecus, and Lemur."

These new data do not support the proposal that increased encephalization is a shared feature between Paranthropus and early Homo. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that Australopithecus africanus could have been ancestral to Homo, and have implications for assessing the tempo and mode of early hominid neurological and cognitive evolution.

These observations suggest that they are derived from a relatively recent duplication event. Previously a study of nonhuman primate RH-like genes demonstrated that ancestral RH gene duplication occurred in the common ancestor of man, chimpanzees and gorillas. By amplification of intron 3 and intron 4 of gorilla RH-like genes, we have now shown that, like man, gorillas possess two types of RH intron 3 (RHCE intron 3 being 289 bp longer than the RHD intron 3) and two types of intron 4 (RHCE intron 4 being 654 bp longer than the RHD intron 4), Here we report the characterization of a cDNA encoded by a gorilla RH-like gene which possesses introns 3 and 4 of the RHCE type. A comparison of this gorilla RHCE-like coding sequence with previously characterized human and ape cDNA sequences suggests that RH genes experienced complex recombination events after duplication in the common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees and gorillas."

On the cDNA level a frameshift deletion of one nucleotide was present in the novel human sequence which was confirmed on the genomic DNA level, In four closely related nonhuman primate species the frameshift deletion was absent while analysis of genomic DNA from different ethnic backgrounds revealed the uniform presence of the frameshift deletion in the human population.

How reliable are human phylogenetic hypotheses?,"['Collard, M', 'Wood, B']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.97.9.5003,APR 25 2000,149,"Cladistic analysis of cranial and dental evidence has been widely used to generate phylogenetic hypotheses about humans and their fossil relatives. However. the reliability of these hypotheses has never been subjected to external validation. To rectify this, we applied identical methods to equivalent evidence from two groups of extant higher primates for whom reliable molecular phylogenies are available, the hominoids and papionins. We found that the phylogenetic hypotheses based on the craniodental data were incompatible with the molecular phylogenies for the groups. Given the robustness of the molecular phylogenies. these results indicate that little confidence can be placed in phylogenies generated solely from higher primate craniodental evidence. The corollary of this is that existing phylogenetic hypotheses about human evolution are unlikely to be reliable. Accordingly, new approaches are required to address the problem of hominin phylogeny."

For a decade my research group has been conducting basic research to establish embryo manipulation techniques and to clarify the reproductive phenomena in nonhuman primates. This article summarizes the past research on in vitro manipulation of nonhuman primate gametes, from collection of reproductive cells and in vitro fertilization to the birth of offspring after embryo transfer, as well as the current status of these research areas. The studies summarized here will directly lead to the development of standard techniques for practical and comprehensive use in nonhuman primates."

Specimens used in the analysis included Neandertals and Upper Palaeolithic early modern Homo sapiens from Europe and individuals from two recent modern human populations. Ontogenetic data for the H. erectus adolescent KNM-WT 15000 and for Gorilla gorilla were included for comparison. Previous reports have indicated that H. erectus demonstrates a pattern of ontogeny characterized by earlier and more rapid linear growth than in modem humans. Results reported here demonstrate that Upper Paleolithic early modem Homo sapiens display a growth trajectory indistinguishable from that of recent modern humans. The pattern of Neandertal ontogeny is not intermediate between the pattern displayed in H. erectus and the derived pattern seen in the modern reference samples and the early modem H. sapiens sample. The Neandertal growth trajectory is consistent with either slow linear growth or advanced dental development. (C) 2000 Academic Press.
Spatial memory and foraging competition in captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Gibeault, S', 'MacDonald, SE']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557796,APR 2000,19,"Spatial memory and foraging competition were investigated in three mother/offspring pairs of western lowland gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla, using a naturalistic foraging task at the Toronto Zoo. Sixteen permanent food sites were placed throughout the animals' enclosures. All of the sites were baited and a pair of animals was free to visit the sites and collect the food. Five of the subjects collected the food with accuracy better than chance. Most of the subjects visited the sites using a pattern, and for half the subjects this was one of adjacency. The high accuracy of five of the subjects and the lack of a consistent adjacency pattern suggest that the animals did in fact use spatial memory. Furthermore, the gorillas tended to avoid visiting food sites that had been previously depleted by their partner. They also appeared to split their search of the enclosures, each visiting only a proportion of the food sites. This indicated that the animals were competing and altering their foraging behaviour based on the behaviour of their partner. Therefore, accuracy was recalculated to take this into account. When the sites depleted by either animal in a pair during a given trial were worked into the accuracy calculations for individual animals, three of the animals still maintained accuracy above chance. This suggests that the animals were not only able to remember which sites they had depleted, but those sites depleted by their foraging partner as well."

In this paper, we have characterized the pattern of p53 alternative splicing in cell lines from five different species. Our results confirm that p53 alternative splicing is species-specific, being detected only in cell lines of rodent origin. Using transient transfection assays, we have established that the rat p53 gene undergoes efficient alternative splicing in both mouse and rat cell lines, thus demonstrating that it has all the necessary cis-acting sequences to be alternatively spliced. In contrast, we were unable to detect any usage of the human alternative 3' splice site under the same experimental conditions. Thus, the low levels or absence of alternatively spliced p53 mRNA in rat and human cell lines seems to be the result of different mechanisms, Our results support the hypothesis that there are species-specific mechanisms implicated in the regulation of p53 activity."
Chromosome 22-specific low copy repeats and the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: genomic organization and deletion endpoint analysis,"['Shaikh, TH', 'Kurahashi, H', 'Saitta, SC', ""O'Hare, AM"", 'Hu, P', 'Roe, BA', 'Driscoll, DA', 'McDonald-McGinn, DM', 'Zackai, EH', 'Budarf, ML', 'Emanuel, BS']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/9.4.489,MAR 1 2000,296,"The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which includes DiGeorge and velocardiofacial syndromes (DGS/VCFS), is the most common microdeletion syndrome. The majority of deleted patients share a common 3 Nib hemizygous deletion of 22q11.2. The remaining patients include those who have smaller deletions that are nested within the 3 Mb typically deleted region (TDR) and a few with rare deletions that have no overlap with the TDR. The identification of chromosome 22-specific duplicated sequences or low copy repeats (LCRs) near the end-points of the 3 Mb TDR has led to the hypothesis that they mediate deletions of 22q11.2. The entire 3 Mb TDR has been sequenced, permitting detailed investigation of the LCRs and their involvement in the 22q11.2 deletions. Sequence analysis has identified four LCRs within the 3 Mb TDR. Although the LCRs differ in content and organization of shared modules, those modules that are common between them share 97-98% sequence identity with one another. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, the end-points of four variant 22q11.2 deletions appear to localize to the LCRs, Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization have been used to identify rearranged junction fragments from three variant deletions. Analysis of junction fragments by PCR and sequencing of the PCR products implicate the LCRs directly in the formation of 22q11.2 deletions. The evolutionary origin of the duplications on chromosome 22 has been assessed by FISH analysis of non-human primates. Multiple signals in Old World monkeys suggest that the duplication events may have occurred at least 20-25 million years ago."
A new morphometric analysis of the hominid pelvic bone,"['Marchal, F', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1999.0360,MAR 2000,16,"This study is based upon a new morphometric technique providing both size and shape variables. It has been applied to 189 pelvic bones of extant humans and African apes as well as to 13 hominid pelvic bones of various taxonomic status. The main aim of this work is to include such fossil bones in the same study in order to set a synthetic comparison of their shape in the light of the yardstick given by the African ape/human pelvic bone comparison. To do so, ratio diagrams are chosen because they are simple and very expressive tools with which to present such comparisons. Shape differences are very well illustrated and quantified by this technique. The ilium appears to be the most different of the three parts of the pelvic bone. Compared to these differences, discrepancies between fossil hominid and extant human bones are of a totally different scale. This shows the architectural unity related to the acquisition of bipedalism by hominids. It is nonetheless possible to detect two levels of difference. The first separates Australopithecus from Homo and could be seen as reflecting locomotor differences between both genera. The second splits both Homo erectus and Neanderthal from modem human pelvic bones. It appears from the hominid fossil record of pelvic bones that two periods of stasis exist and are separated by a period of very rapid evolution corresponding to the emergence of the genus Homo. We are of the opinion that the same could be true for the split between African ape and hominid lineages at the end of the Miocene. (C) 2000 Academic Press."
Isometric scaling of maxillary sinus volume in hominoids,"['Rae, TC', 'Koppe, T']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1999.0357,MAR 2000,40,"Previous hypotheses of maxillary sinus size evolution have proposed one or more changes in the volume of the structure across hominoid phylogeny. These hypotheses have been used subsequently to support the phylogenetic placement of fossil taxa relative to the living Hominoidea. The null hypothesis, that no change in sinus volume independent of size has occurred in ape evolution, is evaluated here by scaling analysis. Mixed sex samples of adult dry crania for the extant ape genera were examined by computer tomography imaging and the volume of the maxillary sinus was obtained. Sinus volume was then regressed, using both least squares and reduced major axis models, against cranial size variables.

The results clearly demonstrate that the null hypothesis of no change in relative sinus volume cannot be rejected; thus, there is no support for hypotheses that maxillary sinus volume, independent of cranial size, has changed in the course of hominoid evolution. This result, in turn, has implications for the phylogenetic placement of fossil taxa and highlights the need for the careful delineation of character states in studies of hominoid systematics.

"Field anesthesia of free-living mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) from the Virunga Volcano Region, central Africa","['Sleeman, JM', 'Cameron, K', 'Mudakikwa, AB', 'Nizeyi, JB', 'Anderson, S', 'Cooper, JE', 'Richardson, HM', 'Macfie, FJ', 'Hastings, B', 'Foster, JW']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,MAR 2000,15,"Twenty-six anesthetic procedures involving 24 free-living mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) from Rwanda or the Democratic Republic of Congo were performed between February 1987 and October 1997. Sixteen procedures were pel formed to remove snares or to treat snare-related wounds, and four of the animals died without recovering consciousness because of their severe medical conditions. Ketamine was used for induction 19 times, tiletamine/zolazepam was used five times, and the agent was nor recorded for two procedures. The mean (+/- SD) ketamine dosage for four animals of known weight was 7.1 +/- 0.9 mg/kg. All induction agents were delivered i.m. by remote injection, and mean induction times for ketamine and tiletamine/zolazepam were 5.5 +/- 2.6 min (n = 12) and 5.4 +/- 3.7 min (n = 5), respectively. Mean recovery times were significantly shorter with ketamine compared with tiletamine/zolazepam (42.0 +/- 24.9 min, n = 9 vs. 75.25 +/- 22.1 min, n = 4). Low hemoglobin oxygen saturation (mean = 86.7%) was recorded in three cases under ketamine anesthesia, and oxygen insufflation is therefore recommended to prevent hypoxemia. Gorillas induced with tiletamine/zolazepam had significantly higher respiratory rates compared with animals given ketamine. Successful anesthesia and recovery, in particular, depended on the assistance of local personnel."

Evidence supporting the requirement for two proline residues for expression of c,"['Westhoff, CM', 'Silberstein, LE', 'Wylie, DE']",TRANSFUSION,10.1046/j.1537-2995.2000.40030321.x,MAR 2000,16,"BACKGROUND: In humans, c antigen expression is associated with a proline residue at amino acid position 103 in the second extracellular loop of the CE protein. Comparison of nonhuman primate Rh proteins suggested that c reactivity might actually involve two proline residues. It has been shown that the RBCs of New World capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) react with anti-c. To further define the amino acid residues involved in c expression, Rh cDNA from the capuchin was analyzed.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Rh transcripts were amplified by reverse transcription PCR from RNA isolated from the reticulocytes of a capuchin monkey and were cloned and sequenced.

RESULTS: Rh transcripts from the capuchin monkey, whose RBCs react with anti-c, were found to encode adjacent proline residues at 102 and 103.

CONCLUSION: Sequencing of Rh transcripts from the capuchin monkey supports the hypothesis that the expression of c requires two adjacent proline residues. Proline causes bends or loops in proteins, which, in this case, might form a unique, stable structure resistant to perturbations induced by changes in upstream or downstream residues. This would explain the scarcity in humans of c variants as compared to the other major Rh antigen variants, and the preservation of c reactivity despite 24-percent divergence between the human and capuchin Rh proteins."
"Cloning of serotonin 5-HT1 receptor subtypes from the chimpanzee, gorilla and Rhesus monkey and their agonist-induced guanosine 5'gamma S-35 triphosphate binding","['Alberts, GL', 'Pregenzer, JF', 'Im, WB', 'Slightom, JL']",NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS,10.1016/S0304-3940(00)00788-6,FEB 25 2000,10,"5-HT1 receptor subtypes ((1B), (1D) and (1F)) have been implicated in migraine pathophysiology and their ligands have been examined for pharmacological actions in various experimental animal models. Considerable divergences exist, however, in their primary sequences between experimental animals and human, and additional models closer to human, such as non-human primates seem to be useful for migraine research. Earlier, we cloned the 5-HT1D, and here 5-HT1B and 5-HT1F receptors from the chimpanzee, gorilla and Rhesus monkey, via polymerase chain reactions with their genomic DNAs and primers designed from the corresponding human receptors. Direct sequencing of PCR products showed that the 5-HT1B receptors from the chimpanzee, gorilla and monkey differ from the human receptor by 0, 1 and 7 residues, respectively while 5-HT1F receptors differ by 0, 3 and 10 residues, respectively. These divergent residues are mostly conservatively substituted and also largely confined to the N-terminal region and the 3rd intracellular loop, away from transmembrane segments and intracellular loops near membrane which are critical for ligand binding and G protein coupling. The chimpanzee 5-HT1D, 5-HT1B and monkey 5-HT1F receptors, as heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, showed robust agonist-induced guanosine 5'gamma S-35 triphosphate (GTP gamma(35)S) binding through activation of G proteins containing G gamma(i) subunits. Moreover, pronounced inhibition of basal GTP gamma(35)S binding by methiothepin (an antagonist), representing constitutively active receptors, was observed with only 5-HT1D. Overall, ligand binding and GTP gamma(35)S binding profiles for these primate receptors are comparable to those for the human receptors and validate non-human primates as useful models for human migraine research.

Each hybrid has been characterized cytogenetically by FISH and molecularly by 37 STSs, evenly spaced along the chromosome. The panel can be exploited to map subregionally DNA sequences on chromosome 4 and to generate partial chromosome paints useful in the characterization of chromosomal rearrangements involving this chromosome. Furthermore, a panel of 84 YACs mapping on chromosome 4 has been characterized by FISH. A subset of this panel is recognized by STSs used in the somatic cell hybrid characterization. In this way a correlation between the genetic and the physical maps can be established. These resources have been used to investigate the conservation of the phylogenetic chromosome IV in great apes. The results indicate that all the pericentric inversions that differentiate chromosome TV in these species are distinct and that one of the breakpoints frequently lies very close to the centromere. In 4 instances, the YAC containing the breakpoint was identified. The breakpoint in IVq of PTR and MMU lies in the same YAC, suggesting that this breakpoint has been utilized twice in the evolutionary history of this chromosome. (C) 2000 Academic Press."
The brain and its main anatomical subdivisions in living hominoids using magnetic resonance imaging,"['Semendeferi, K', 'Damasio, H']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1999.0381,FEB 2000,118,"Primary comparative data on the hominoid brain are scarce and major neuroanatomical differences between humans and apes have not yet been described satisfactorily, even at the gross level. Basic questions that involve the evolution of the human brain cannot be addressed adequately unless the brains of all extant hominoid species are analyzed. Contrary to the scarcity of original data, there is a rich literature on the topic of human brain evolution and several debates exist on the size of particular sectors of the brain, e.g., the frontal lobe.

In this study we applied a non-invasive imaging technique (magnetic resonance) on living human, great ape and lesser ape subjects in order to investigate the overall size of the hominoid brain. The images were reconstructed in three dimensions and volumetric estimates were obtained for the brain and its main anatomical sectors, including the frontal and temporal lobes, the insula, the parieto-occipital sector and the cerebellum.

A remarkable homogeneity is present in the relative size of many of the large sectors of the hominoid brain, but interspecific and intraspecific variation exists in certain parts of the brain. The human cerebellum is smaller than expected for an ape brain of human size. It is suggested that the cerebellum increased less than the cerebrum after the split of the human lineage from the African ancestral hominoid stock. In contrast, humans have a slightly larger temporal lobe and insula than expected, but differences are not statistically significant.

Humans do not have a larger frontal lobe than expected for an ape brain of human size and gibbons have a relatively smaller frontal lobe than the rest of the hominoids. Given the fact that the frontal lobe in humans and great apes has similar relative size, it is parsimonious to suggest that the relative size of the whole of the frontal lobe has not changed significantly during hominid evolution in the Plio-Pleistocene.

DNA archives and our nearest relative: The trichotomy problem revisited,"['Satta, Y', 'Klein, J', 'Takahata, N']",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1006/mpev.2000.0704,FEB 2000,95,"Ever since Thomas H. Huxley correctly identified the chimpanzee and the gorilla as the two closest relatives of the human, the problem of the relationship among the three species (""the trichotomy problem"") has remained unresolved. Comparative morphology and other classical methods of biological investigation have failed to answer definitively whether the chimpanzee or the gorilla is the closest relative of the human species. DNA sequences, both mitochondrial and nuclear, too, have provided equivocal solutions, depending on the region of the genome analyzed. Random sorting of ancestral allelic lineages, sequence convergence, and sequence exchanges between alleles or duplicated loci have been identified as likely factors confounding the interpretation of the interrelationships among the three species, In the present study most of these difficulties are overcome by identifying evolutionary causes that might potentially provide misleading information. Altogether, 45 loci consisting of 46,855 bp are analyzed. About 60% of the loci and approximately the same proportion of phylogenetically informative sites support the human-chimpanzee clade, The remaining 40% of loci and sites support the two alternatives equally. It is demonstrated that, while incompatibility between loci can, be explained by random sorting of allelic Lineages, incompatibility within loci must be attributed largely to the joint effect of recombination and genetic drift. The trichotomy problem can be properly addressed only within this framework. (C) 2000 Academic Press."
Rapid evolution of male reproductive genes in the descent of man,"['Wyckoff, GJ', 'Wang, W', 'Wu, CI']",NATURE,NA,JAN 20 2000,368,"A diverse body of morphological and genetic evidence has suggested that traits pertaining to male reproduction may have evolved much more rapidly than other types of character(1-3). Recently, DNA sequence comparisons have also shown a very high level of divergence in male reproductive proteins between closely related Drosophila species(4-6), among marine invertebrates(7,8) and between mouse and rat(9). Here we show that rapid evolution of male reproductive genes is observable in primates and is quite notable in the lineages to human and chimpanzee. Nevertheless, rapid evolution by itself is not necessarily an indication of positive darwinian selection; relaxation of negative selection is often equally compatible with the DNA sequence data. By taking three statistical approaches, we show that positive darwinian selection is often the driving force behind this rapid evolution. These results open up opportunities to test the hypothesis that sexual selection plays some role in the molecular evolution of higher primates."
The Great Ape Project. Equality beyond humanity.,"['Scharmann, W']",ALTEX-ALTERNATIVEN ZU TIEREXPERIMENTEN,NA,2000,5,"The Great Ape Project (GAP) is an appeal of 36 scientist from different disciplines aiming at the legal equalisation of the non-human great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans) with man. The appeal is expressed by a number of essays stating zoological, genetical, ethological, anthropological, ethical and psychological knowledge and, based on these arguments, demanding the abolition of the species barrier between human beings and great apes.

The central point of the initiative is the ""Declaration on Great Apes"", claiming the inclusion of great apes in the ""community of equals"" and thus securing three basic rights for all great apes: 1. The Right of Life: 2. The Protection of Individual Liberty; 3. The Prohibition of Torture.

Not only experiments with great apes and their their capture from the wilderness will be banned, but it is also intended to enfranchise as many great apes as possible from research laboratories and zoos. As a legal basis fr the achievement of basic rights most of the authors plead for the idea of conferring the moral status of person"" on great apes.

Criticism of the GAP is due to anthropocentrism. Rejection is especially expressed by advocates of pathocentric ethics who argue that the species barriers will not be abolished but only shifted, running then between the great apes and the remaining living beings.

However the GAP resulted in a greater retention in the use of apes for experiments in several; industrial countries.

Additionally, the popular literature published by ethologists in the passed decades has supported a more responsible attitude of the public towards primates.

Despite of all efforts the survival of the great apes is greatly endangered within their native countries."

Back to the roots of a new exon - The molecular archaeology of a SP100 splice variant,"['Rogalla, P', 'Kazmierczak, B', 'Flohr, AM', 'Hauke, S', 'Bullerdiek, J']",GENOMICS,10.1006/geno.1999.6008,JAN 1 2000,26,"Retropseudogenes are intronless DNA sequences sharing a high degree of homology with the cDNA of their corresponding active genes. They are thought to have originated by reverse transcription of messenger RNA and reintegration of the cDNA into the genome. Usually considered a type of evolutionary waste, they melt into the background of their surrounding DNA by the loss of similarity to the active gene or disappear from the genome by the accumulation of deletions. On the other hand, in this paper we describe the evolutionary recycling of this genomic waste. Recently, a splice variant of the gene encoding the nuclear protein SP100 was identified in which the 3' part of the cDNA is replaced by an alternative exon apparently encoding an HMG1-DNA-binding domain. We were able to show that this HMG box is contributed by a new exon arising from an HMG1 retropseudogene that we have molecularly characterized in detail. In addition to being found in human cells, corresponding fusion transcripts were shown in Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and Hylobates lar, but not in Macaca mulatta, Genomic DNA from M. mulatta enabled us to amplify by PCR the 5' part but not the 3' part of the HMG1 retropseudogene. From our data we thus can date the underlying retrotransposition to more than 35 million years ago. Our findings offer a model as to how new exons may evolve during evolution. To our knowledge this is the first example of a retropseudogene becoming part of an active gene in which both parental parts are well characterized and remain in-frame with their cDNA.

During a month-long sun ev in 1997, observation and sign of humans and large mammals, including ape nest-sites, were recorded on 81.2 km of line transects in three sectors of the park and reserve. Human activities. including intensities of lugging and hunting, appeared to decrease with distance from the population centres and were lower an the park than in the reserve sectors. Encounter rates with sign of duikers Cephalophus spp., monkeys Cercopithecus spy. and Cercocebus albigena, elephants Loxodonta africana, and gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla were generally Ion er in regions of high human activity in the reserve than in the park sectors. Nevertheless, gorilla nest-site densities did not vary significantly between sectors or with human activity levels. A high frequency of zero (bare ground) nests at RES suggests that gorilla surveys that rely on line transect methods and use nest decomposition rates from other studies may sometimes underestimate gorilla densities. This study suggests that current levels of exploitation in managed hunting zones of national forest reserves may be negatively affecting targeted wildlife populations in these zones. Assessments should be a regular part of efforts to monitor the health of wildlife populations in managed protected zones. Participation by Central Africans in research will continue to benefit conservation and development efforts."

Polymorphisms at the DRD4 gene have been examined for association with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders and normal behavioral variation. The DRD4 gene is unusual in its high amount of expressed polymorphism in humans. Here we study the identification of a polymorphic tandem duplication of 120 bp located 1.2 kb upstream of the initiation codon. The duplicated region contains consensus sequences of binding sites for several known transcription factors, suggesting that different alleles may differ in their transcriptional activity. Because chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans lack the duplication, the duplicated allele is inferred to be derived. The frequency of this derived duplication allele ranges from 0.40-0.81 in the 11 populations from around the world typed for this polymorphism, Am. J, Med, Genet. (Neuropsychiatr.

Female dominance relationships among captive western lowland gorillas: Comparisons with the wild,"['Scott, J', 'Lockard, JS']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/156853999500721,DEC 1999,12,"Female dominance relationships were studied among three family groups of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) housed in large enclosures at Howletts Wild Animal Park, in Kent, England. In common with gorillas in their natural habitat, the Howletts gorillas forage throughout the day on low nutrient foods. However, the latter differ, at least from mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei); in that they also have relatively frequent access to high nutrient, high energy novel food items which are patchily distributed in time and space, and defendable. It was predicted that. despite these differences, the Howletts: females: would resemble mountain gorillas in forming adult female dominance hierarchies (determined from supplant interactions) in which older females that have lived in the group the longest are dominant to younger females, more recent to the group. The comparison was made with mountain gorillas as they are the only gorilla subspecies for which such data exist for wild-living populations. As predicted, an age/tenure-based dominance hierarchy was found to be the case for tho je groups at Howletts where there was considerable variation between the females' ages and length of group tenure. As gorillas and chimpanzees resemble more closely each other in forming age/tenure-based dominance hierarchies than they do other female-transfer primate species, it is proposed that the gorilla-chimpanzee pattern may have common phylogenetic origins. In addition, the order of progression of gorillas into their indoor living quarters appears to be a good indicator of supplant-dominance relationships among adult group members. It was also found that. despite bring removed from their natural habitat, dominant males in captivity still lead their groups during group travel in the same manner that do males in the wild: either at the head, or bringing up the rear. Though primate social behaviour may be flexible depending on immediate context and life history variables, this flexibility may well remain within evolutionarily defined parameters, leading to species-typical patterns in general social interactions."

In this paper we report an additional peculiar feature of these regions that we discovered while analyzing, by FISH, the evolutionary conservation of primate phylogenetic chromosome IX. if the position of the centromere is not taken into account, a relatively small number of rearrangements must be invoked to account for interspecific differences. Conversely, if the centromere is included, a paradox emerges: The position of the centromere seems to have undergone, ill some species, an evolutionary history independent From the surrounding markers. A significant number of additional rearrangements must be proposed to reconcile the order of the markers with centromere position. Alternatively, the evolutionary emergence of neocentromeres can be postulated."

Enamel hypoplasia in deciduous teeth of great apes: Do differences in defect prevalence imply differential levels of physiological stress?,"['Lukacs, JR']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199911)110:3<351::AID-AJPA7>3.0.CO;2-2,NOV 1999,18,"This paper presents new data on enamel hypoplasia in the deciduous canine teeth of great apes. The enamel defect under consideration is known as localized hypoplasia of primary canines (LHPC), and is characterized by an area of thin or missing enamel on the labial surface of deciduous canine teeth (Skinner [1986a] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 69:59-69). Goals of this study are: 1) to determine if significant differences in the frequency of LHPC occur among three genera of great apes, and 2) to evaluate variation in LHPC prevalence among great apes as evidence of differential physiological stress. Infant and juvenile apes with deciduous teeth were examined at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History (n = 100) and at the Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History (n = 36). Deciduous teeth were observed under oblique incandescent light, with the naked eye and with a 10x hand lens. Enamel hypoplasia was scored using Federation Dentaire International (FDI)-Defects of Dental Enamel (DDE) standards. Hypoplasias were recorded by drawing defect location and size on a dental chart, and by measuring defect size and location with Hellos needlepoint dial calipers.

The prevalence of LHPC is reported by genus and sex, using two approaches: 1) the frequency of affected individuals-those having one or more deciduous canine teeth scored positive for LHPC; and 2) the number of canine teeth scored positive for LHPC as a percentage of all canine teeth observed. Variation in defect size and location will be described elsewhere.

Localized hypoplasia of primary canine teeth was found in 62.5% of 128 individual apes, and in 45.5% of 398 great ape deciduous canines. As in humans, LHPC is the most common form of enamel hypoplasia in deciduous teeth of great apes, while LEH is rare or absent. The distribution and pattern of expression of LHPC in great apes is similar to that described in humans: side differences are not significant, but mandibular canines exhibit the defect two to five times more often than maxillary canine teeth. Differences in LHPC prevalence by sex are small and not significant. Intergeneric differences are large and non-random: chimpanzees (Pan) exhibit a significantly lower frequency of LHPC (22%, n = 50) by individual count, than either the orangutan (Pongo, 88.0%, n = 25) or the gorilla (Gorilla, 88.7%, n = 53). Tooth count prevalences exhibit a similar pattern of variation and are also statistically significant. These findings suggest that large bodied great apes (gorilla and orangutan) may be under greater physiological stress during perinatal and early postnatal development than the chimpanzee. The size, position, and timing of LHPC lesions are currently under analysis and may yield more insight into the etiological origin of this enamel defect. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

The gorilla CEL gene is 10.5 kb long and comprises 11 exons intervened by introns similar to the situation in man, mouse and rat. The encoded protein is 998 amino acids long and includes a 23 amino acid-long leader peptide. Comparison of the coding sequence, excluding exon 11, of CEL from gorilla and man reveals a 97% similarity. Exon 11, which encodes the characteristic proline rich repeats, contains 39 repeated units in gorilla compared to 16 in man. A truncated CEL pseudogene, with the same organization as that found in man, is also shown to be present in the gorilla genome. The gorilla CEL pseudogene is 4.9 kb in length and consists of 5 exons interrupted by introns. Southern analysis of the gorilla CEL locus shows that the locus is arranged in a similar way as in man with the functional CEL gene being the most 5' one.

To bring further insight to the events involved in the rearrangement of the CEL locus, genomic Southern analyses were performed across several primates; Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus and Macaca arctoides. Results presented show that the CEL gene duplication occurred prior to the separation of Hominidae (man, chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan) from Old World monkeys (macaque). The deletion of the original CEL gene giving rise to the truncated version of the CEL gene seems, however, to be restricted to man and the great apes only. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Morphological variation in great ape and modern human mandibles,"['Humphrey, LT', 'Dean, MC', 'Stringer, CB']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1046/j.1469-7580.1999.19540491.x,NOV 1999,39,"Adult mandibles of 317 modern humans and 91 great apes were selected that showed no pathology. Adult mandibles of Pan troglodytes troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus and Gorilla gorilla gorilla and from 2 modern human populations (Zulu and Europeans from Spitalfields) were reliably sexed. Thirteen measurements were defined and included mandibular height, length and breadth in representative positions. Univariate statistical techniques and multivariate (principal component analysis and discriminant analysis) statistical techniques were used to investigate interspecific variability and sexual dimorphism in human and great ape mandibles, and intraspecific variability among the modern human mandibles. Analysis of interspecific differences revealed some pairs of variables with a tight linear relationship and others where Homo and the great apes pulled apart from one another due to shape differences. Homo and Pan are least sexually dimorphic in the mandible, Pan less so than Homo sapiens, but both the magnitude of sexual dimorphism and the distribution of sexually dimorphic measurements varied both among and between modern humans and great apes. Intraspecific variation among the 10 populations of modern humans was less than that generally reported in studies of crania (74.3% of mandibles were correctly classified into 1 of 10 populations using discriminant functions based on 13 variables as compared with 93% of crania from 17 populations based on 70 variables in one extensive study of crania). A subrecent European population (Poundbury) emerged as more different from a recent European population (Spitalfields) than other more diverse modern populations were from each other, suggesting considerable morphological plasticity in the mandible through time. This study forms a sound basis on which to explore mandibular variation in Neanderthals, early Homo sapiens and other more ancient fossil hominids."
Phylogenetic analysis of a retroposon family in African great apes,"['Kim, HS', 'Wadekar, RV', 'Takenaka, O', 'Hyun, BH', 'Crow, TJ']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/PL00000083,NOV 1999,10,"The SINE-R retroposon family has been identified by its relationship with the long terminal ret peats (LTRs) of human endogenous retrovirus class K (HERV-K) as a mobile element that has evolved recently in the human genome. Here we examined the recent evolutionary history of this class of elements by a:PCF: approach to genomic DNA from the African great apes and by phylogenetic analysis including comparison with the HERV K10 parent sequence. With primers derived from a cDNA sequence from human brain, we identified 27 sequences from the chimpanzee and 16 from the gorilla. Phylogenetic comparisons with previously recognized sequences from the human and from the orangutan and gibbon revealed wide overlap of elements across species, suggesting multiple origins in the course of hominoid evolution. Two human elements SINE-R.C2 and HS307 were the furthest removed from the HERV-K10 sequence but these two elements were closely related to three elements from the chimpanzee and four elements from the gorilla. This group of elements (our clusters 14 and 15) appears to have transposed late in hominoid evolution. One element (Ch-M16) showed 99.1% sequence identity with the SLNE-R.C2 element, which is human-specific. Thus the SINE-R family appears to have continued to be active in transposition throughout the course of primate evolution."
Mechanisms of human mitochondrial DNA maintenance: The determining role of primary sequence and length over function,"['Moraes, CT', 'Kenyon, L', 'Hao, HL']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL,NA,OCT 1999,57,"Although the regulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number is performed by nuclear-coded factors, very little is known about the mechanisms controlling this process. We attempted to introduce nonhuman ape mtDNA into human cells harboring either no mtDNA or mutated mtDNAs (partial deletion and tRNA gene point mutation). Unexpectedly, only cells containing no mtDNA could be repopulated with nonhuman ape mtDNA. Cells containing a defective human mtDNA did not incorporate or maintain ape mtDNA and, therefore died under selection for oxidative phosphorylation function. On the other hand, foreign human mtDNA was readily incorporated and maintained in these cells. The suicidal preference for self-mtDNA showed that functional parameters associated with oxidative phosphorylation are less relevant to mtDNA maintenance and copy number control than recognition of mtDNA self-determinants. Non-self-mtDNA could not be maintained into cells with mtDNA even if no selection for oxidative phosphorylation was applied. The repopulation kinetics of several mtDNA forms after severe depletion by ethidium bromide treatment showed that replication and maintenance of mtDNA in human cells are highly dependent on molecular features, because partially deleted mtDNA molecules repopulated cells significantly faster than full-length mtDNA. Taken together, our results suggest that mtDNA copy number may be controlled by competition for limiting levels of trans-acting factors that recognize primarily mtDNA molecular features. In agreement with this hypothesis, marked variations in mtDNA levels did not affect the transcription of nuclear-coded factors involved in mtDNA replication."
"The Itombwe Massif, Democratic Republic of Congo: biological surveys and conservation, with an emphasis on Grauer's gorilla and birds endemic to the Albertine Rift","['Omari, I', 'Hart, JA', 'Butynski, TM', 'Birhashirwa, NR', 'Upoki, A', ""M'Keyo, Y"", 'Bengana, F', 'Bashonga, M', 'Bagurubumwe, N']",ORYX,NA,OCT 1999,18,"In 1996, the first major biological surveys in the Itombwe Massif in over 30 years revealed that significant areas of natural habitat and remnant faunal populations remain, but that these are subject to ongoing degradation and over-exploitation. At least 10 areas of gorilla Gorilla gorilla graueri occurrence, including eight of 17 areas identified during the first survey of the species in the massif in 1959, were found. Seventy-nine gorilla nest sites were recorded and at least 860 gorillas were estimated to occupy the massif. Fifty-six species of mammals were recorded. Itombwe supports the highest representation, of any area, of bird species endemic to the Albertine Rift highlands. Twenty-two of these species were recorded during the surveys, including the Congo bay owl Phodilus prigoginei, which was previously known from a single specimen collected in Itombwe nearly 50 years ago. No part of Itombwe is officially protected and conservation initiatives are needed urgently. Given the remoteness and continuing political instability of the region, conservation initiatives must collaborate with traditional authorities based in the massif, and should focus at the outset on protecting the gorillas and limiting further degradation of key areas."
"Status and conservation of primates in Odzala National Park, Republic of the Congo","['Bermejo, M']",ORYX,10.1046/j.1365-3008.1999.00081.x,OCT 1999,33,"A survey of diurnal primate populations was carried out in Odzala National Park, Republic of the Congo, over 3 months in 1994 and 2 months in 1995. The park contains a high diversity and species-specific abundance of primates, and has the highest number of diurnal primates (10 species) in the forest block of Central Africa. Eight species of monkey: greater white-nosed monkey Cercopithecus nictitans, moustached monkey Cercopithecus cephus, crowned guenon Cercopithecus pogonias, De Brazza's monkey Cercopithecus neglectus, talapoin Miopithecus talapoin, white-cheeked mangabey Cercocebus albigena, agile mangabey Cercocebus galeritus and guereza Colobus guereza, as well as gorilla Gorilla g. gorilla and chimpanzee Pan t. troglodytes were sighted in the survey. Monkey species richness was highest in dense inundated forest and thicket, with all eight species occurring in these habitats, whereas only four species were found in terra firma forest (consisting of the park's two main habitats, open-canopy Marantaceae forest and closed-canopy primary forest). Three of the four species (C. nictitans, C. cephus and C. albigena) present in terra firma forest were most abundant in closed-canopy primary forest (1.4, 1.0 and 0.6 groups per km, respectively) while the fourth (C. pogonias) was most abundant in open-canopy Marantaceae forest. Gorilla nests were most abundant in open-canopy Marantaceae forest(12.1 nests per km), while chimpanzee nests were mostly found in closed-canopy primary forest and Marantaceae forest (14 and 12 nests per km, respectively). Odzala has the highest recorded densities of western lowland gorilla (mean=5.4 individuals per sq km) and chimpanzee (mean=2.2 individuals per sq km) in Central Africa. The high densities of gorillas and chimpanzees may be a result of the high productivity of the forest and low poaching pressure. Conservation measures to ensure the maintenance of conditions in the area, such as educational programmes, are suggested."
"Characterisation of a novel HLA-A pseudogene, HLA-BEL, with significant sequence identity with a gorilla MHC class I gene","['Williams, F', 'Curran, MD', 'Middleton, D']",TISSUE ANTIGENS,10.1034/j.1399-0039.1999.540405.x,OCT 1999,8,"During the development of an HLA-A polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP) method far the identification of HLA-A*24 and -A*30 alleles, group amplification resulted in the formation of an unusual PCR product in certain individuals This fragment was approximately 900 bp smaller than the experted product and was also detected in some non-HLA-A*24 and -A*3D-positive individuals acting as negative controls for the group specific amplification. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this product identified it as a unique class I gene sequence displaying homology to both primate and human class I A-locus genes. The entire gene was amplified using PCR and the complete DNA sequence information from exon 1 to exon 8, including introns, was determined. A recombination event was identified which results in the fusion of intron 2 with intron 3, causing a deletion of the intervening exon 3 sequence. In addition, there are two cytosine insertions in the poly-cytosine stretch at the start of exon 4 which cause a frameshift and premature termination. The exon 1 and 2 sequences most closely align with the gorilla allele A*0501, displaying only five mismatches. PCR analysis has established that the gene is associated with the following HLA-A types: HLA-A*3001, -A*3301, -A*3303, -A*6802, A*2901, -A*0203, -A*0205 and -A*31012. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis of individuals containing this gene failed to detect any mRNA transcription, suggesting that this is a previously undescribed non-expressed class I pseudogene which we have provisionally named HLA-BEL. Its unique gene structure gives a possible insight into the evolutionary pathway that created HLA class I genes."
Growth changes in internal and craniofacial flexion measurements,"['May, R', 'Sheffer, DB']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199909)110:1<47::AID-AJPA4>3.0.CO;2-7,SEP 1999,4,"Growth changes in both internal and craniofacial flexion angles are presented for Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and modern humans. The internal flexion angle (IFA) was measured from lateral radiographs, and the craniofacial flexion angle (CFA) was calculated from coordinate data. Stage of dental development is used as a baseline for examination of growth changes and nonparametric correlations between flexion angles and dental development stage are tested for significance. In Gorilla, the IFA increases during growth. The IFA is relatively stable in Pan and modern humans. Pan and Gorilla display an increase in the CFA. However, this angle decreases during growth in modern humans. Flexion angles were derived from coordinate data collected for several early hominid crania. Measurements for two robust australopithecine crania indicate strong internal flexion. It has been suggested that cerebellar expansion in this group may relate to derived features of the posterior cranial base. In general, australopithecine crania exhibit craniofacial flexion intermediate between great apes and modern humans. The ""archaic"" Homo sapiens specimen from Kabwe is most similar to modern humans.

Use of experimenter-given manual and facial cues by gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) in an object-choice task,"['Peignot, P', 'Anderson, JR']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/0735-7036.113.3.253,SEP 1999,55,"Captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) were tested for their ability to use experimenter-given manual and facial cues in an object-choice task. Performance levels were high when the experimenter tapped on or pointed at an object that contained a reward. Performance remained good when the experimenter witheld manual gestures and instead gazed with eyes and head oriented toward the correct object. In contrast, when only the experimenter's eye orientation served as the cue, the gorillas did not appropriately complete the task. Repeated attempts to establish prolonged mutual eye contact with 1 gorilla failed. The gorillas' failure to use eye signals as a cue may be due to an aversion to direct eye contact and contrasts with findings in other great apes. The results may indicate a difference among great ape species in detection of intentionality, but an alternative interpretation is that performance in such tests is influenced by factors such as rearing experience and temperament."
Development of a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction procedure for the detection of marine caliciviruses with potential application for nucleotide sequencing,"['Reid, SM', 'Ansell, DM', 'Ferris, NP', 'Hutchings, GH', 'Knowles, NJ', 'Smith, AW']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS,10.1016/S0166-0934(99)00088-9,SEP 1999,13,"A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedure is described for the detection of marine caliciviruses including vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV), San Miguel sea lion virus (SMSV), bovine Tillamook virus (BCV Bos-1) and caliciviruses (CV) isolated from dolphin (Cetacean CV), gorilla (Primate CV) and rattlesnake (Reptile CV) using primers (1F and 1R) designed from the capsid-coding region of the viral genome. These primers were compared with those described by Neill, J.D, and Seal, B.S., 1995: Development of PCR primers for specific amplification of two distinct regions of the genomes of San Miguel sea lion and vesicular exanthema of swine viruses, Mel. Cell. Probes 9, 33-38 (Hel1/Hel2), which had been designed from the 2C-like region of the calicivirus genome. Both sets proved to be extremely useful diagnostic tools for all of the known marine calicivirus serotypes with the exception of three: SMSV-8 and -12 and mink CV suggesting that these three caliciviruses may belong to a different group. Neither of the two primer sets reacted with strains of the vesicular disease viruses of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease (SVD) or vesicular stomatitis (VS) nor with two feline caliciviruses (FCV). The 1F/1R primer set has the advantage over the Hel1/Hel2 set in that it generates a larger PCR product for nucleotide sequence investigations and so provides greater opportunity for identifying molecular differences between the viruses.

Many human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) proviruses are unique to humans,"['Barbulescu, M', 'Turner, G', 'Seaman, MI', 'Deinard, AS', 'Kidd, KK', 'Lenz, J']",CURRENT BIOLOGY,10.1016/S0960-9822(99)80390-X,AUG 26 1999,151,"Background: Endogenous retroviruses contribute to the evolution of the host genome and can be associated with disease. Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) is related to the mouse mammary tumor virus and is present in the genomes of humans, apes and cercopithecoids (Old World monkeys). It is unknown how long ago in primate evolution the full-length HERV-K proviruses that are in the human genome today were formed.

Results: Ten full-length HERV-K proviruses were cloned from the human genome. Using provirus-specific probes, eight of the ten were found to be present in a genetically diverse set of humans but not in other extant hominoids. Intact preintegration sites for each of these eight proviruses were present in the apes, A ninth provirus was detected in the human, chimpanzee, bonobo and gorilla genomes, but not in the orang-utan genome. The tenth was found only in humans, chimpanzees and bonobos, Complete sequencing of six of the human-specific proviruses showed that full-length open reading frames for the retroviral protein precursors Gag-Pro-Pol or Env were each present in multiple proviruses.

Conclusions: At least eight full-length HERV-K genomes that are in the human germline today integrated after humans diverged from chimpanzees. All of the viral open reading frames and cis-acting sequences necessary for HERV-K replication must have been intact during the recent time when these proviruses formed. Multiple full-length open reading frames for all HERV-K proteins are present in the human genome today."

We have examined an 832 bp. region, encompassing a putative Lateral Plate Mesoderm (LPM) enhancer element in a variety of anthropoid apes. The interspecific comparisons reveal extensive substitutions occurring within this region, with a marked bias in favor of C-->T transitions within the enhancer element. The pattern of these substitutions suggests that the LPM enhancer region is subject to specific sequence and compositional constraints that are only revealed through comparative sequencing. These constraints produce an enhancer signature, the CpG microisland, which may be useful in identifying additional regulatory elements located within the NOX complexes. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Pneumatic processes in the temporal bone of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla),"['Sherwood, RJ']",JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199908)241:2<127::AID-JMOR3>3.0.CO;2-P,AUG 1999,19,"The ontogeny of human temporal bone pneumatization has been well studied from both comparative and clinical perspectives. While a difference in the extent of air cell distribution has been noted in our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and gorillas, the processes responsible have been relatively unexplored. To examine these processes, a large, age-graded series of hominoid skulls was radiographed and the progress of pneumatization recorded. Additionally, a subsample of 30 chimpanzees and 12 gorillas was subjected to high-resolution CT scanning. Neonatal specimens show a well-developed mastoid antrum, as well as a capacious hypotympanum extending into the petrous apex. In African apes, as in humans, the mastoid antrum serves as the focus for air cell expansion into the mastoid and immediately adjacent areas. In chimpanzees and gorillas, however, a pronounced lateral structure, described as the squamous antrum, serves as the focus of pneumatization for anterior structures such as the squamous and zygomatic. The diminution of this structure in Homo sapiens explains the difference in air cell distribution in these regions. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Corticotropin-releasing hormone in chimpanzee and gorilla pregnancies,"['Smith, R', 'Wickings, EJ', 'Bowman, ME', 'Belleoud, A', 'Dubreuil, G', 'Davies, JJ', 'Madsen, G']",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM,10.1210/jc.84.8.2820,AUG 1999,47,"In humans, the length of gestation and the onset of parturition have been linked to the exponential production of placental CRH and a late gestational decline in maternal plasma CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP). CRH has been shown to have direct effects on the myometrium and on the fetal adrenal, where it stimulates production of the estrogen precursor dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate. In vitro placental CRH production is stimulated by cortisol and inhibited by progesterone. To determine whether this mechanism might operate in other apes, we sampled eight chimpanzees and two gorillas through their pregnancies for CRH, CRH-BP, cortisol, estradiol, progesterone, and alpha-fetoprotein. We show that both chimpanzee and gorilla maternal plasma CRH concentrations rise exponentially as observed in the human. The gorillas exhibited a human-like antepartum fall in CRH-BP, whereas CRH-BP in the chimpanzee remained stable. Pregnancy-associated changes in cortisol, estradiol, progesterone, and alpha-fetoprotein were qualitatively similar to those observed in humans. Maternal plasma cortisol correlated with plasma CRH in both gorillas (r = 0.60; P < 0.05) and chimpanzees (r = 0.36; P < 0.02). Further, there was a strong correlation between plasma estradiol and the log of plasma CRH in the gorilla (r = 0.93; P < 0.0001) and in the chimpanzee (r = 0.72; P < 0.001), which is consistent with the hypothesis that placental CRH determines the placental production of estradiol by stimulating the production of fetal adrenal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Plasma CRH and progesterone were positively correlated providing no in vivo support for progesterone inhibition of CRH release."
Evolution of MHC-G in primates: a different kind of molecule for each group of species,"['Arnaiz-Villena, A', 'Morales, P', 'Gomez-Casado, E', 'Castro, MJ', 'Varela, P', 'Rojo-Amigo, R', 'Martinez-Laso, J']",JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE IMMUNOLOGY,10.1016/S0165-0378(99)00026-1,JUL 1999,25,"When MHC-G molecules in primates (New World and Old World monkeys, Anthropoids and humans) were compared phylogenetically, very different evolutionary patterns within each species were found; their molecules did not have a straight forward and linear development throughout the postulated evolutionary pathway of primates. The earlier New World monkeys (South America) had relatively more alleles and the polymorphism was placed in the T-cell receptor (TcR), NK receptors and antigen binding sites; MHC-G probably works as a classical class I presenting molecule in these monkeys. MHC-G intron 2 from New World monkeys does not show the typical 23 bp deletion found in all other more recent primate species. Thus, it is possible that MHC-G molecules in New World monkeys belong to a different lineage than the MHC from higher primates. Another early lineage, Eurasian Old World monkeys, shows stop codons at exon 3: MHC-G proteins lacking the alpha 2 domain may functionally suffice or otherwise reading-through stop-codon translational mechanisms may exist, as shown for other genes. Orangutans show lower (but significant) polymorphism than New World monkeys at NK, TcR and antigen binding regions; gorilla and chimpanzee show very low polymorphism. Humans only show three different HLA-G proteins with changes not affecting NK, TcR or antigen binding sites. It is observed that the more exposed the mother to allogeneic fetuses (polygamy), the less polymorphic HLA-G is observed within a given species. The data are concordant with the postulated immune inhibitory function for MHC-G in Old World monkeys, anthropoids and humans both at placental and inflammatory level.

Spontaneous use of sticks as tools by captive gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Nakamichi, M']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557584,JUL 1999,16,"The present report describes the spontaneous use of sticks as tools by young adult gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in a social group at the San Diego Wild Animal Park, CA, USA. Three 8-year-old gorillas tone female and two males) threw sticks into the foliage of trees, which the gorillas could not climb due to electric wire, to knock down leaves and seeds. Two of the three gorillas selected sticks that were more suitable (i.e, longer or thicker sticks) for throwing. Moreover, they looked up at the target (i.e. the foliage of the tree) before throwing and grasped the stick at a position appropriate for throwing (i.e. the end of the stick). They were more likely to throw sticks when particular adult group members were not nearby. These two gorillas also pulled branches of trees toward themselves by using sticks to capture them (branch-pulling), and one of these two beat a branch with a stick to knock down leaves and seeds (branch-beating. One of these two gorillas used much longer sticks for branch-pulling than for stick-throwing, indicating that he was capable of task-dependent selection of sticks. Analyzing the spontaneous use of sticks as tools by gorillas in captivity can lead to a better understanding of not only their cognitive ability but also of their social relationships, which may otherwise be concealed."
Concerted evolution of the tandem array encoding primate U2 snRNA (the RNU2 locus) is accompanied by dramatic remodeling of the junctions with flanking chromosomal sequences,"['Pavelitz, T', 'Liao, DQ', 'Weiner, AM']",EMBO JOURNAL,10.1093/emboj/18.13.3783,JUL 1 1999,16,"The genes encoding primate U2 snRNA are organized as a nearly perfect tandem array (the RNU2 locus) that has been evolving concertedly for >35 Myr since the divergence of baboons and humans. Thus the repeat units of the tandem array are essentially identical within each species, but differ between species. Homogeneity is maintained because any change in one repeat unit is purged from the array or fixed in all other repeats. Intriguingly, the cytological location of RNU2 has remained unchanged despite concerted evolution of the tandem array. We had found previously that junction sequences between the U2 tandem array and flanking DNA were subject to remodeling over a region of 200-300 bp during the past 5 Myr in the hominid lineage. Here we show that the junctions between the U2 tandem array and flanking DNA have undergone dramatic rearrangements over a region of 1 to >10 kbp in the 35 Myr since divergence of the Old World Monkey and hominid lineages. We argue that these rearrangements reflect the high level of genetic activity required to sustain concerted evolution, and propose a model to explain why maintenance of homogeneity within a tandemly repeated multigene family would lead to junctional diversity."
Suppression of a mitochondrial tRNA gene mutation phenotype associated with changes in the nuclear background,"['Hao, HL', 'Morrison, LE', 'Moraes, CT']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/8.6.1117,JUN 1999,42,"We previously have characterized a pathogenic mtDNA mutation in the tRNA(Asn) gene, This mutation (G5703A) was associated with a severe mitochondrial protein synthesis defect and a reduction in steady-state levels of tRNA(Asn). We now show that, although transmitochondrial cybrids harboring homoplasmic levels of the mutation do not survive in galactose medium, several galactose-resistant clones could be obtained. These cell lines had restored oxidative phosphorylation function and 2-fold higher steady-state levels of tRNA(Asn) when compared with the parental mutant cell line, The revertant lines contained apparently homoplasmic levels of the mutation and no other detectable alteration in the tRNA(Asn) gene. To investigate the origin of the suppression, we transferred mtDNA from the revertants (143B/206 TK-) to a different nuclear background (143B/207 TK-, 8AG(r)), These new transmitochondrial cybrids became defective once again in oxidative phosphorylation and regained galactose sensitivity. However, galactose-resistant clones could also be obtained by growing the 8AG(r) transmitochondrial cybrids under selection. Because the original rate of reversion was higher than that expected by a classic second site nuclear mutation, and because of the aneuploid features of these cell lines, we searched for the presence of chromosomal alterations that could be associated with the revertant phenotype, These studies, however, did not reveal any gross changes. Our results suggest that modulation of the dosage or expression of unknown nuclear-coded factor(s) can compensate for a pathogenic mitochondrial tRNA gene mutation, suggesting new strategies for therapeutic intervention."
Evolution of a HOXB6 intergenic region within the great apes and humans,"['Deinard, A', 'Kidd, K']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1999.0298,JUN 1999,48,"Data accumulated over the past decade from several loci suggest that nonhuman primates have a greater amount of intraspecific genetic variation relative to humans. In phylogenetic reconstructions among primates that are based on genetic data, therefore, it becomes essential to adequately sample the population(s) being analyzed. Inadequate sampling may not only underestimate variation within any given population, but such an underestimate may confound any phylogenetic or population-specific conclusions implied by the data. Here we present inter- and intraspecific data on the molecular evolution of an approximately 1.0 kb intergenic HOXB6 sequence among humans, common chimpanzees, pygmy chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans. To date, this study represents the most comprehensive investigation of a noncoding nuclear locus among the great apes and humans that examines the nature and amount of intraspecific variation in DNA sequences. Not only do these HOXB6 data continue to support earlier findings that Homo sapiens sapiens has less genetic variation than any gnat ape species (Ruano et al., 1992; Deinard & Kidd, 1995), but they strongly suggest that a high level of genetic polymorphism existed within the common ancestor of the African ape clade (Homo-Pan-Gorilla). Despite detecting two nucleotide substitutions linking Pan and Homo, we caution against concluding that the HOXB6 data definitively support a Home-Pan clade to the exclusion of Gorilla. Rather, we believe that taking into consideration the level of genetic polymorphism that is likely to have existed within the common ancestor, the most prudent conclusion that can be made from all available data, including morphological, karyotypic and genetic data, may be that speciation among Homo-Pan-Gorilla is best represented by a ""trichotomy"".

Chronic hypertension with subsequent congestive heart failure in a western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Miller, CL', 'Schwartz, AM', 'Barnhart, JS', 'Bell, MD']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,JUN 1999,12,"Chronic severe subclinical systemic hypertension was diagnosed in a 28-yr-old male western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Thoracic radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography revealed an enlarged heart with a hypertrophied left ventricle, mitral regurgitation, and a persistent left bundle branch black. Enalapril, later combined with nifedipine, was of some value in reducing the hypertension, with partial reversal of cardiac enlargement and resolution of the bundle branch block. Two years after initiation of treatment, the gorilla developed lethargy and dyspnea. The diagnosis of heart failure was confirmed under anesthesia; the gorilla did not recover and was euthanized. Postmortem examination confirmed congestive heart failure with chronic, fibrosing cardiomyopathy similar to that in other gorillas."

Clinical signs of the disease were pyrexia, abdominal distention, splenomegaly, and lethargy. Acute lymphocytic leukemia has rarely been reported in this species, and therapy was based on human oncologic protocols. Remission induction chemotherapy resulted in complete clearing of leukemia cells from the bone marrow. Consolidation and maintenance chemotherapy followed. Therapy was facilitated by the use of an infusion port for i.v. treatments and an indwelling lumbar catheter for intrathecal therapy. Side effects associated with chemotherapy were inappetence, moderate alopecia, pancytopenia resulting in sepsis, and bleeding tendency. in spite of initial success, the leukemia reappeared 120 days into treatment. The gorilla was euthanized 7 days later when respiratory distress developed. Intensive care by the animal staff was a key factor in the treatment of this gorilla."

From this data we determined 214 proposed ancestral alleles (the sequence found in the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees). In a diverse human population set, we found that SNP alleles with higher frequencies were more likely to be ancestral than less frequently occurring alleles, There were, however, exceptions. We also found three shared human/pygmy chimpanzee polymorphisms, all involving CpG dinucleotides, and two shared human/gorilla polymorphisms, one involving a CpG dinucleotide.

"Factors affecting mirror behaviour in western lowland gorillas, Gorilla gorilla
","['Shillito, DJ', 'Gallup, GG', 'Beck, BB']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1006/anbe.1998.1062,MAY 1999,32,"To date, it has proven difficult to demonstrate mirror self-recognition in gorillas. However, gorillas display pronounced gaze aversion that may prevent them from spending a sufficient amount of time exploring their mirror images to understand that they are the source of their reflections. It has also been suggested that the presence of observers may inhibit gorillas from engaging in mark-directed behaviours. To overcome th problem of gaze aversion, we used an angled-mirror apparatus developed by Anderson st Roeder (1989, Primates, 30, 581-587) that prevented two gorillas at the National Zoological Park from making direct eye contact with their reflections. To counter the observer inhibition hypothesis, we conducted mark tests on these animals using video cameras. Despite addressing these and other concerns in a series of four experiments, the gorillas did not show compelling evidence of self-recognition, even after over 4 years of mirror exposure.

Male mating patterns in wild multimale mountain gorilla groups,"['Robbins, MM']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1006/anbe.1998.1063,MAY 1999,52,"lAlthough mountain gorillas, Gorilla gorilla beringei, are classified as having a one-male mating system, approximately 40% of the social units are multimale groups. I observed two multimale groups of mountain gorillas at the Karisoke Research Center, Rwanda, Africa, for 17 months to determine male mating patterns and male-male mating harassment in relation to both male dominance rank and female reproductive status. Dominant males mated significantly more than did individual subordinate males, and dominant males mated more with cycling adult and pregnant females. The dominant males participated in 47 and 83% of observed matings in the two groups. Subordinate males were more likely than dominant males to mate with subadult females. Eleven of 14 females were observed to mate with more than one male, and multiple males mated with three of the five females observed at the probable time of conception. Mating harassment was initiated and received by both dominant and subordinate males. Mating harassment occurred infrequently (during 30 and 22% of matings in each group), usually consisted of mild aggression; and usually terminated copulations by subordinate males, but not those by dominant males. These results suggest that multimale mountain gorilla groups can be favourable environments for subordinate males to obtain mating opportunities. Dominant males may be unable or unwilling to prevent subordinate males from mating. Based on behavioural observations, mountain gorillas can have a multimale mating system but further research on the role of females in male mating success and paternity determination is needed to understand fully this species' mating system.

"Shape of the orbital opening: individual characterization and analysis of variability in modern humans, Gorilla gorilla, and Pan troglodytes","['Schmittbuhl, M', 'Le Minor, JM', 'Allenbach, B', 'Schaaf, A']",ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER,10.1016/S0940-9602(99)80049-1,MAY 1999,9,"The description of the human orbital shape is principally qualitative in the classical literature, and characterised by adjectives such as circular, rectangular or quadrangular. In order to provide a precise quantification and interpretation of this shape, a study based on automatic image analysis and Fourier analysis was carried out on 45 human skulls (30 males, 15 females), and for comparison on 61 skulls of Gorilla gorilla (40 males, 21 females), and 34 skulls of Pan troglodytes (20 males, 14 females). Sexual dimorphism in the shape of the orbital opening was not demonstrated. Its dominant morphological features could be characterized by Fourier analysis; elliptical elongation and quadrangularity were dominant morphological features of the shape of the orbital opening in the three species. Elliptical elongation was more marked in humans and Pan, whereas quadrangularity was particularly emphasized in Gorilla. An intraspecific variability of the shape of the orbital opening existed in humans, Gorilla and Pan, and seemed close in the three species. Interspecific partition between humans, Gorilla and Pan was demonstrated despite the variability observed in the three species studied. Interspecific differences between Gorilla and the Pan-humans group were principally explained by the differences in quadrangularity, and by differences in orientation of triangularity and pentagonality. Differences in the shape of the orbital opening between humans and Pan were principally explained by differences in hexagonality, and by differences in orientation of quadrangularity. A closeness of shape between some humans and some individuals in Pan and, to a lesser degree, with some individuals in Gorilla was observed, demonstrating the existence of a morphological continuum of the shape of the orbital opening in hominoids."
Differential pharmacology between the guinea-pig and the gorilla 5-HT1D receptor as probed with isochromans (5-HT1D-selective ligands),"['Pregenzer, JF', 'Alberts, GL', 'Bin Im, W', 'Slightom, JL', 'Ennis, MD', 'Hoffman, RL', 'Ghazal, NB', 'TenBrink, RE']",BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY,10.1038/sj.bjp.0702532,MAY 1999,29,"1 Both the 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B receptors are implicated in migraine pathophysiology. Recently isochromans have been discovered to bind primate 5-HT1D receptors with much higher affinity than 5-HT1B receptors. In the guinea-pig, a primary animal model for anti-migraine drug testing, however, isochromans bound the 5-HT1D receptor with lower affinity than the gorilla receptor.

2 This species-specific pharmacology was investigated, using site-directed mutagenesis on cloned guinea-pig receptors heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Mutations of threonine 100 and arginine 102 at the extracellular side of transmembrane II of the guinea-pig 5-HT1D receptor to the corresponding primate residues, isoleucine and histidine, respectively, enhanced its affinity for isochromans to that of the gorilla receptor, with little effects on its affinities for serotonin, sumatriptan and metergoline. Free energy change from the R102M mutation was about twice as much as that from the T100I mutation.

3 For G protein-coupling, serotonin marginally enhanced GTP gamma(35)S binding in membranes expressing the guinea-pig 5-HT1D receptor and its mutants, but robustly in membranes expressing the gorilla receptor. Sumatriptan enhanced GTP gamma(35)S binding in the latter nearly as much as serotonin. and several isochromans by 30-60% of serotonin.

4 We discovered key differences in the function and binding properties of guinea-pig and gorilla 5-HT1D receptors, and identified contributions of I100 and H102 of primate 5-HT1D receptors to isochroman binding. Among common experimental animals, only the rabbit shares I100 and H102 with primates, and could be useful for studying isochroman actions in vivo."
DNA sequence variation in a non-coding region of low recombination on the human X chromosome,"['Kaessmann, H', 'Heissig, F', 'von Haeseler, A', 'Paabo, S']",NATURE GENETICS,10.1038/8785,MAY 1999,176,"DNA sequence variation has become a major source of insight regarding the origin and history of our species(1-5) as well as an important tool for the identification of allelic variants associated with disease. Comparative sequencing of DNA has to date focused mainly on mitochondrial (mt) DNA, which due to its apparent lack of recombination and high evolutionary rate lends itself well to the study of human evolution(1). These advantages also entail limitations. For example, the high mutation rate of mtDNA results in multiple substitutions that make phylogenetic analysis difficult and, because mtDNA is maternally inherited, it reflects only the history of females. For the history of males, the non-recombining part of the paternally inherited Y chromosome can be studied(2). The extent of variation on the Y chromosome is so low that variation at particular sites known to be polymorphic rather than entire sequences are typically determined(6). It is currently unclear how some forms of analysis (such as the coalescent) should be applied to such data, Furthermore, the lack of recombination means that selection at any locus affects all 59 Mb of DNA. To gauge the extent and pattern of point substitutional variation in non-coding parts of the human genome, we have sequenced 10 kb of non-coding DNA in a region of low recombination at Xq13.3. Analysis of this sequence in 69 individuals representing all major linguistic groups reveals the highest overall diversity in Africa, whereas deep divergences also exist in Asia. The time elapsed since the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) is 535.000+/-119.000 years, We expect this type of nuclear locus to provide more answers about the genetic origin and history of humans."
A review of nutritional and motivational factors contributing to the performance of regurgitation and reingestion in captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Lukas, KE']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/S0168-1591(98)00239-1,APR 23 1999,31,"Regurgitation and reingestion (R/R) is a common phenomenon in captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), but it has never been reported in wild populations. Although changes in diet have been shown to reduce the behavior, little is known about the underlying mechanisms that lead to its development and maintenance. In this paper, a comparative analysis of ruminatory behavior in humans and stereotypic behavior in captive, domesticated animals reveals several nutritional and motivational factors that may contribute to the sustained performance of this behavior in captive gorillas. Additional research is needed to evaluate temporal, seasonal, gustatory, social, individual, and medical influences on this behavior. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

Patterns of sexual dimorphism in the hominoid distal humerus,"['Lague, MR', 'Jungers, WL']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1998.0274,APR 1999,11,"Basic biomechanical principles predict that body size differences and differences in the positional behavior of primates should impact on the design of the locomotor skeleton. Allometric distortions in joint shape might be expected between sexes if the degree of body size dimorphism is substantial and/or if sex-specific differences exist in behavior. Nevertheless, there are few documented cases of sexual dimorphism in the limb joints of hominoids, despite substantial body size dimorphism and some reports of intersexual differences in positional behavior. This study re-examines sexual dimorphism in the hominoid distal humerus using coordinate data, and distinguishes explicitly between degree of dimorphism (i.e., the magnitude of intersexual differences) and pattern of dimorphism (i.e., the nature of these differences).

Using a variety off multivariate morphometric methods (e.g., canonical variates analysis of Mosimann shape variables; Euclidean Distance Matrix Analysis of both form and pattern difference matrices), we address the following issues: (1) do males and females of different species and subspecies (or ethnic groups for humans) maintain similar joint shapes? (2) are multiple patterns of dimorphism evident in this region of hominoids? (3) are differences and similarities in degree and pattern predicted by phylogenetic propinquity and positional behavior?

For the most part, our results support earlier findings that sexual dimorphism in the shape of the anthropoid elbow is slight. Of the eight taxa considered here, only the western lowland gorillas exhibited significant differences in the shape of the distal humerus. Gorilla gorilla gorilla also displays a significantly different pattern of dimorphism from the orang-utan. Pattern differences between Andaman Islanders and both mountain gorillas and the orang-utan also approach statistical significance (P<0.06 and P<0.08, respectively). Overall, and despite marked differences in the degree of dimorphism, the knuckle-walking African apes are more similar in patterns of dimorphism to each other than to other taxa (e.g., gorillas are more similar to orang-utans in degree, but more similar to chimpanzees and bonobos in pattern). We could find no definitive ""human pattern"" in our results and suspect that this is because human upper limbs face less stringent mechanical constraints since they are relieved of locomotor stresses (but we cannot rule out the possibility of undocumented differences among our human groups in sex-specific, work-related activities). We anticipate finding additional pattern differences among anthropoids in articular dimorphism as we add other taxa to our sample (including fossil hominids), and examine other joint systems.

Relative orbitonasal overlap in African great apes and humans quantified by the automatic determination of horizontal and vertical lines of reference,"['Schmittbuhl, M', 'Le Minor, JM', 'Schaaf, A']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557554,APR 1999,2,"The relative positions of the orbital and nasal openings in African apes and humans were studied by a new methodological approach based on the automatic determination, by image analysis techniques, of horizontal and vertical lines of reference. The material used consisted of Gorilla gorilla (38 males and 20 females), Part troglodytes (19 males and 13 females), and modern Homo sapiens (51 males and 41 females). This allowed the relative positions of the orbital and nasal openings to be quantified by the determination of medio-lateral and vertical orbitonasal indices of overlap. In all the species studied, a medio-lateral orbitonasal overlap was systematically observed. This indicates that nasal breadth is always larger than interorbital distance. Medio-lateral overlap was greatest in Gorilla, reduced in Homo, and intermediate in Part. By contrast, only Homo presents systematically a vertical overlap; a vertical overlap was sometimes observed in Pan, but never in Gorilla. Homo presented the greatest vertical overlap, and Gorilla the least; the disposition in Pan was intermediate. The interspecific study of the relationships between medio-lateral and vertical overlap in Gorilla, Part, and Homo demonstrated that an increase in vertical overlap was correlated with a decrease of medio-lateral overlap. Sexual dimorphism in orbitonasal relationships was systematically greatest in Gorilla, and reduced in Pan and Homo, this is also the case for the orbital, nasal, and orbitonasal parameters measured in this study. All these results provide interesting elements for understanding the morphological evolution of the middle face in hominoids."
"Tree structure and sex differences in arboreality among western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic","['Remis, MJ']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557560,APR 1999,34,"The aim of six months of research in 1995 on the gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic, was to study the effects of tree structure, relative numbers of arboreal feeding sites, and sex differences in body size on arboreal foraging. The analysis presented here also documents inter-annual variation in fruit availability and climbing by silverback gorillas by comparing the 1995 results to those from earlier research, 1990-1992. This analysis suggests that female gorillas maintain similar levels of arboreality in fruit-rich and fruit-poor seasons and years, but silverbacks may be more terrestrial when fruit is scarce or difficult to access. Trees of different shapes present different numbers of feeding sites to bigger males and smaller females. Male climbing is affected by the availability of fruit, and small trees with narrow crowns that lend easy access to fruit from the core. This study suggests that the energetics of vertical climbing and biomechanical constraints imposed by small branch feeding sites in the periphery of trees may constrain the arboreal behavior of male gorillas. Fine-tuned comparisons of food availability, tree structure, and variation in social context of behavior across habitats, will assist efforts to understand differences in ecology among populations and species of African apes."

Similar chimeras were also detected in human chromosomes 10 and Y in human-hamster hybrid cells containing individual human chromosomes. This finding was interpreted as evidence of transpositions of the chimera in the genome. PCR analyses detected the chimera in the genomes of chimpanzee and gorilla, but not in that of orangutan. These data demonstrate that the chimera appeared in the primate germ cells more than 10 million years ago, before divergence of the human/chimpanzee and the gorilla lineages.

Growth changes in measurements of upper facial positioning,"['May, R', 'Sheffer, DB']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199903)108:3<269::AID-AJPA3>3.0.CO;2-0,MAR 1999,9,"Growth changes in the position of the midline upper face are examined for samples of Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and modern humans. Horizontal and vertical distances between nasion and the anterior end of the cribriform plate are plotted against stage of dental development. Kendall's nonparametric correlations between facial positioning and stage of dental development are tested for significance.

In African apes, the upper face becomes more projecting and positioned higher relative to the anterior cranial base. The extent of this horizontal and vertical separation reflects primarily facial size. In modern humans, the upper face becomes more projecting but is relatively stable in its vertical position. Comparison of Pan and modern human crania in the youngest dental age category indicates that the upper face of modern humans is positioned lower early in postnatal life.

The position of the upper face (glabella) relative to the anterior and posterior cranial base is presented for several fossil hominid crania. The fossil crania are similar to Pan and modern humans in facial projection relative to the anterior cranial base. However, glabella is positioned low in the fossil crania. Total facial projection (relative to hormion) for Sts 5 is similar to the mean for Gorilla. Fossil Homo and robust australopithecine crania display very projecting upper faces. We suggest that the upper face of Homo is projecting due to the length of the anterior cranial fossa, while robust australopithecines possess a thick frontal bone. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

By diffusing through extracellular matrices more efficiently than TGF beta-FMs, noggin may have a principal role in creating morphogenic gradients2. During mouse embryogenesis, Nog is expressed at multiple sites(3), including developing bones(4,5). Nog(-/-) mice die at birth from multiple defects that include bony fusion of the appendicular skeleton(3,4). We have identified five dominant human NOG mutations in unrelated families segregating proximal symphalangism (SYM1; OMIM 185800) and a de novo mutation in a patient with unaffected parents. We also found a dominant NOG mutation in a family segregating multiple synostoses syndrome (SYNS1; OMIM 186500); both SYM1 and SYNS1 have multiple joint fusion as their principal feature(6,7). All seven NOG mutations alter evolutionarily conserved amino CI acid residues. The findings reported here confirm that NOG is essential for joint formation and suggest that NOG requirements during skeletogenesis differ between species and between specific skeletal elements within species."

By quantitative indirect immunofluorescence assay and quantitative immunoblotting it was evaluated that the number of D-gor antigenic sites per gorilla red cell varies from a level equivalent to that observed for human RhD positive cells to a level eight times higher. By immunoblotting with a rabbit reagent specific for the carboxylic end of human Rh-polypeptides it was demonstrated that RBCs from all gorillas, whatever their D-gor phenotype, possess 33000 relative molecular mass Rh-like polypeptides. The expression of the D-gor antigen was shown to be associated with the presence of three polymorphic bands defined by Southern blot using a human exon 4 RHCE probe, and to a length polymorphism of gorilla intron 3 evidenced by polymerase chain reaction. By contrast, the expression of the D-gor antigen was not associated to the length polymorphism of gorilla intron 4 which is related to the presence or absence of an Alu-Sx element in intron 4, paralleling the situation observed in human. These results confirmed the presence in the gorilla genome of at least two RH-like genes, one of which being responsible for D-gor polymorphism. The phylogenesis of the human and gorilla RH genes is discussed in light of the comparison of intron 4 sequences."
Phylogenetic history of hominoid DRB loci and alleles inferred from intron sequences,"['Bergstrom, TF', 'Erlandsson, R', 'Engkvist, H', 'Josefsson, A', 'Erlich, HA', 'Gyllensten, U']",IMMUNOLOGICAL REVIEWS,10.1111/j.1600-065X.1999.tb01404.x,FEB 1999,32,"The evolutionary relationships among the MHC class II DRB4, DRB5 and DRB6 loci as well as the allelic Lineages and alleles of the DRB1 locus were studied based on intron 1 and intron 2 sequences from humans, chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), bonobo (Pan paniscus) and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). The phylogenetic trees for these sequences indicate that most of the DRB1 allelic lineages predate the separation of the hominoid species studied, consistent with previous analysis of the coding sequences of these lineages. However, the intron sequence variation among alleles within DRB1 allelic lineages is very limited, consistent with the notion that the majority of the contemporary alleles have been generated within the last 250,000 years. The clustering of the DRB1 allelic lineages *08 and *12 with *03 supports a common ancestry for the DR8 and DR52 haplotypes. Similarly, the clustering of DRB1 allelic lineages *15 and *01 with the DRB3 locus is consistent with a common ancestry for the DR1 and DR51 haplotypes. Two cases of recombination around the second exon were observed: 1) the HLA-DRB6 locus appears to have been generated through a recombination between a DRB5 allele and an ancestral DRB6 allele, and 2) the gorilla sequence Gogo-DRB1*03 appears to have been generated through a recombination between the DRB3 locus and an allele from the DRB1*03 allelic Lineage. The nucleotide substitution rate of DRB introns was estimated to 0.85-1.63 x 10(-9) per site per year, based on comparisons between the most closely related sequences from different hominoid species. This estimate is similar to the substitution rate for other intronic regions of the primate genome."
"Ecological constraints on the foraging effort of western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic","['Goldsmith, ML']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1020528115829,FEB 1999,64,"Recent studies demonstrate that western lowland gorillas incorporate much more fruit into their diet than Virunga mountain gorillas do. Very little is known, however about how the frugivorous behavior of western gorillas influences their daily ranging behavior which may ultimately affect social factors such as group size and structure. I examined the influence of diet and the spatiotemporal availability of plant foods on the foraging effort of nonhabituated western lowland gorilla groups during 17 months at Bai Hokou in the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African Republic. I determined diet from indirect methods and gorilla plant food availability and spatial distribution from phenology and line transects. Daily path length gives an estimate of foraging effort and was the distance paced, following fresh gorilla trails, from morning to evening nest sites. The availability and distribution of fruit and its consumption by gorillas varied seasonally. When concentrating on fruits, gorillas traveled significantly farther (mean = 3.1 km/day) than when their diet consisted mostly of nonfruit vegetation, such as leaves and woody pith, stems and bark (mean = 2.1 km/day). The amount of herbaceous vegetation in the diet did not vary seasonally and did not influence daily path length. The best environmental predictor of foraging effort was fruit density, or a measure combining both density and spatial pattern: coefficient of dispersion. In addition, when fruit patches were small, path length tended to increase but not significantly. Compared with results of other studies, gorillas at Bai Hokou travel farther (mean = 2.6 km/day) than gorillas in Gabon (mean = 1.7 km/day) and five times farther than mountain gorillas in the Virungas (mean = 0.5 km/day). Increased foraging effort of gorillas in this region, especially during the fruiting season, may have profound effects on group size and structure."
Did knuckle walking evolve twice?,"['Dainton, M', 'Macho, GA']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1998.0265,FEB 1999,43,"Although African great apes share a similar quadrupedal locomotor behaviour, there are marked differences in hand morphology and size between the species. Hence, whilst all three species (two genera) of African ape frequently knuckle walk as adults, debate remains-as to whether this behaviour is derived from a common ancestor or whether it evolved in parallel in chimpanzees and gorillas. This exploratory morphometric study of the sub-adult and adult wrist of these two genera aims to contribute to this debate.

A total of twenty-seven dimensions of the lunate, triquetral, hamate and capitate of sub-adult and adult Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla were analysed in order to determine whether carpal dimensions are generally ontogenetically scaled, and whether differences in growth trajectories, or length of growth, and adult morphologies can be explained by behavioural differences between the two species. Only 56% of all dimensions studied were ontogenetically scaled in subadults and some of these dimensions exhibit differing adult proportions between the two species. In general, the dimensions analysed fell into two categories: Pan and Gorilla either follow the same growth trajectories (Pattern A) or the Pan reduced major axis (RMA) regressions were significantly transposed above those of Gorilla (Pattern B). Additionally, it was found that Gorilla carpals appear to cease growing relatively earlier than those of Pan. While a small number of differences, notably those of the lunate, can be accounted for by differences in behaviour between the species, the majority of differences indicate heterochronic modifications of development during evolution, which correspond to kinematic differences in knuckle walking between the African great apes. In light of morphological, behavioural and ecological data currently available it is parsimonious to suggest that knuckle walking has evolved in parallel in the two lineages.

A pollical palmar interosseous muscle (PPIM) was found in 86% of individuals (17/20 of the Witwatersrand sample; 13/15 of the Stony Brook sample). Here, we offer a definition of the PPIM in an attempt to resolve the long-standing question of its existence and its relationship to the adductor pollicis obliquus and the deep head of flexor pollicis brevis. We suggest that the human hand usually possesses four palmar interossei as well as four dorsal interossei. Anat Rec 254:159-165, 1999. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Resampling methodology (bootstrapping) is used here to establish that A, africanus has a greater craniofacial size range than chimpanzees or modern humans, a range which is best attributed to a moderately high degree of sexual dimorphism. Compared to other fossil hominins, this variation is similar to that of Homo habilis (sensu late) but less than that of A. boisei. The finding of moderately high dimorphism is corroborated by a CV-based estimate and ratios between those specimens considered to be male and those considered to be female. Inferences about the pattern of craniofacial dimorphism in the A. africanus face currently rely on the relationship of morphology and size. Larger specimens, particularly Stw 505, show prominent superciliary eminences and glabellar regions, but in features related in part to canine size, such as the curvature of the infraorbital surface, large and small specimens of A. africanus are similar. In this respect, the pattern resembles that of modern humans more so than chimpanzees or lowland gorillas. A, africanus may also show novel patterns of sexual dimorphism when compared to extant hominines, such as in the form of the anterior pillar. However, males of the species do not exhibit characteristics of more derived hominins, such as A. robustus. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Under exceptional observation conditions we studied a western lowland gorilla population visiting the Maya salt-clearing (north of the Pare national d'Odzala, P.N.O., Congo) over an 8 month period; 36 groups and 18 solitary individuals (a total of 420 individuals) have been identified visiting the clearing, which suggests a high gorilla density in the region. Ninety-six percent of the gorillas entered the clearing in groups. One-male groups had a mean size of 11.2. Ninety percent of solitary individuals were silver-back males. Compared with other populations of both lowland gorillas and mountain gorillas, the Maya population had the highest immature rate and the highest number of infants per female. Ecological correlates that could explain the attractiveness of the Maya clearing are discussed. The present status and the renewal rate of the Maya population indicate the need for further studies and confirm the importance of developing eco-tourism in this region as part of the sustainable park management activities developed by the ECOFAC programme (European Union). The results also provide arguments to support the proposal for extending the P.N.O. to include this region, which is rich in salt-clearings and attracts many other key-species of mammal such as forest elephants.

Aping our ancestors: Comparative aspects of reproductive ecology,"['Bentley, GR']",EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY,NA,1999,32,"There are many similarities among mammalian species in how ecological factors affect their reproductive potential and individual life histories. One of the most important limiting factors is the availability of sufficient resources to partition among essential growth, maintenance, and eventual reproduction.(1-3) How each mammal juggles these constraints constitutes its unique life history and determines its success as a species. Yet, as Hill and Hurtado(4) recently argued, life-history analyses are rarely applied to human reproduction. In fact, despite the demonstrated significance of adequate nutrition for reproductive performance among most mammalian species that have been studied,(1,3,5) many demographers, and even some biological anthropologists, have resisted the idea that humans, except under extreme famine conditions, might be subject to the same kinds of nutritional constraints that affect other mammals (6-9)."
Recently integrated human Alu repeats: finding needles in the haystack,"['Roy, AM', 'Carroll, ML', 'Kass, DH', 'Nguyen, SV', 'Salem, AH', 'Batzer, MA', 'Deininger, PL']",GENETICA,10.1023/A:1003941704138,1999,65,"Alu elements undergo amplification through retroposition and integration into new locations throughout primate genomes. Over 500,000 Alu elements reside in the human genome, making the identification of newly inserted Alu repeats the genomic equivalent of finding needles in the haystack. Here, we present two complementary methods for rapid detection of newly integrated Alu elements. In the first approach we employ computational biology to mine the human genomic DNA sequence databases in order to identify recently integrated Alu elements. The second method is based on an anchor-PCR technique which we term Allele-Specific Alu PCR (ASAP). In this approach, Alu elements are selectively amplified from anchored DNA generating a display or 'fingerprint' of recently integrated Alu elements. Alu insertion polymorphisms are then detected by comparison of the DNA fingerprints generated from different samples. Here, we explore the utility of these methods by applying them to the identification of members of the smallest previously identified subfamily of Alu repeats in the human genome termed Ya8. This subfamily of Alu repeats is composed of about 50 elements within the human genome. Approximately 50% of the Ya8 Alu family members have inserted in the human genome so recently that they are polymorphic, making them useful markers for the study of human evolution."

The recent isolation of subtelomeric probes specific for human (HSA) chromosomes 1q, 11p, 13q, and 16q has prompted us to cross-hybridize these to the chromosomes of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, PTR), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla, GGO), and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus, PPY) to search for their equivalent locations in the great apes. Hybridization signals to the 1q subtelomeric DNA sequence probe were observed at the termini of human (HSA) 1q, PTR 1q, GGO 1q, PPY 1q, while the fluorescent signals to the 11p subtelomeric DNA sequence probe were observed at the termini of HSA 11p, PTR 9p, GGO 9p, and PPY 8p. Fluorescent signals to the 13q subtelomeric DNA sequence probe were observed at the termini of HSA 13q, PTR 14q, GGO 14q, and PPY 14q, and positive signals to the 16p subtelomeric DNA sequence probe were observed at the termini of HSA 16q, PTR 18q, GGO 17q, and PPY 19q. These findings apparently suggest sequence homology of these DNA families in the ape chromosomes. Obviously, analogous subtelomeric sequences exist in apes' chromosomes that apparently have been conserved through the course of differentiation of the hominoid species."
Dental microwear of Griphopithecus alpani,"['King, T', 'Aiello, LC', 'Andrews, P']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1998.0258,JAN 1999,33,"The examination of microscopic dental wear allows inferences to be made about diet in extinct species. This study reconstructs the diet of Griphopithecus alpani, a 15 Ma fossil hominoid from the Miocene site of Pasalar in north-western Turkey, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the microscopic wear on its molar teeth. The microwear patterns of Griphopithecus are compared with those of three extant. hominoid taxa-Gorilla gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes vents, and Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus. The microwear on three occlusal wear surfaces is examined in this study, and sex and age differences are also included. Analysis of variance is performed on the following microwear variables-feature density, pit density, striation density, the ratio of pits relative to striations, pit widths, and striation widths. Griphopithecus has significantly higher microwear feature densities and higher percentages of pits than Gorilla. It also has larger pit frequencies and narrower striations than both Pan and Gorilla. There are no significant differences between the microwear patterns of Griphopithecus and Pongo. This suggests that the diet of Griphopithecus was more similar to that of Pongo, which consumes mainly fruit, and occasionally hard and unripe fruits and nuts, than to that of Pan and Gorilla. In addition, the high percentage of pits displayed by Griphopithecus may indicate that it was ingesting harder fruits and/or objects than the extant hominoids, although this is not a significant difference. There also are consistent variations in the microwear present on the three different wear facets examined in the study-Phase II facets display more microwear and pitting than the Phase I surface examined. The results of this study do not indicate variation in dental microwear according to sex or age. (C) 1999 Academic Press."

The mandibular and dental remains are fragmentary, but the postcranial fossils are informative. Comparisons with Australopithecus, modern human, chimpanzee and gorilla hand bones suggest that the Turkwel hominid was most like Australopithecus afarensis and A. africanus. Carpometacarpal articulations are intermediate between those of modern humans and African apes, suggesting enhanced gripping capabilities compared with extant apes. The hamulus was strikingly large, similar in proportion only to Neandertals and some gorillas, suggesting the presence of powerful forearms and hands. There are no indicators of adaptations to knuckle-walking or suspensory locomotion in the hand, and the pedal phalanx suggests that this hominid was habitually bipedal. (C) 1999 Academic Press."

As part of a wider study of their role as seed dispersers in tropical rain forest, the importance of gorillas as consumers of three species of tropical tree was investigated. The species studied were Ganophyllum giganteum (Sapindaceae), Cola lizae (Sterculiaceae) and Uapaca guineensis (Euphorbiaceae). Gorillas swallowed large quantites of seeds of these species whenever they were available, and removed a considerable proportion of the crop from trees they visited. The differences in abundance and distribution of these trees, and their varied dispersal strategies influenced the quantity of seeds that was removed by gorillas. Uapaca can be seen as having a generalist fruiting strategy, with a wide range of consumers, whereas the other species are more specialist, gorillas being the principal dispersers. Compared to other consumers, this study showed that gorillas provided potentially high quality dispersal because: (i) they were reliable visitors to trees of these species; (ii) they swallowed and dispersed large numbers of seeds; (iii) they treated seeds benignly and often deposited them in sites favourable for establishment."
Development of a competitive ELISA for detection of primates infected with monkey B virus (Herpesvirus simiae),"['Blewett, EL', 'Saliki, JT', 'Eberle, R']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS,NA,JAN 1999,11,"Two competitive ELISAs (C-ELISAs) are described that allow detection of antibodies against monkey B virus (BV, Cercercopithecine herpesvirus 1). The assays utilize monoclonal antibodies (MABs) directed against the BV glycoprotein B (gB). Two of these MABs specifically recognize BV gB while a third MAB also reacts with the gB homologues of other primate alpha-herpesviruses (herpes simplexvirus-1, HSV-1; HSV-2; simian agent-8, SA8; and Herpesvirus papio-2, HVP2). A C-ELISA using the single cross-reactive MAB 3E8 allowed detection of host antibodies against HSV-1, HSV-2, SA8, HVP2 or BV, thus proving to be a sensitive assay for the detection of infection by any of these primate alpha-herpesviruses. The C- ELISA using BV-specific MABs was less sensitive but did allow some discrimination between infection by BV versus other alpha-herpesviruses. It was also shown that a C-ELISA using HVP2 as antigen and the cross-reactive MAB 3E8 was as sensitive for detection of BV antibody in macaque sera as an assay employing BV antigen. This test format allows detection of BV-infected primates without the biohazards associated with preparation and use of BV antigen. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

Social interactions between captive adult male and infant lowland gorillas: Implications regarding kin selection and zoo management,"['Enciso, AE', 'Calcagno, JM', 'Gold, KC']",ZOO BIOLOGY,NA,1999,0,"Interactions between unrelated and related silverback-infant dyads are compared in an attempt to assess the influence that kinship may have on male parental behavior. Observational data were collected on each member of two silverback-infant dyads, in two separate enclosures at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, IL. The silverback was the father of the infant in one dyad, and unrelated to the infant in the other. Each infant was responsible for initiating most of the encounters with its respective group silverback. However, based on the frequency and duration of interactions, there is a significantly higher degree of affiliation and tolerance within the silverback-offspring dyad. Furthermore, the unrelated infant was the recipient of more than 40% of the agonistic behaviors exhibited by the silverback, whereas no such encounters were recorded within the related dyad. Although alternative explanations must be considered, these findings are consistent with kin selection theory, are similar to observations documented for wild mountain gorillas, and provide uncommon comparative data on adult male interactions with related and unrelated infants. In addition, this study offers behavioral information relevant to the management of captive gorillas, which often requires the introduction of immatures into non-natal groups.

In the present study we quantified the changes in nearest-neighbor associations in a group consisting of a silverback male, three adult females, and two sub-adult females after the introduction of five hand-reared infants. Additionally, we examined the associations among kin and non-kin group members to determine whether genetic relatedness was a factor influencing the integration of the infants into the group and the subsequent patterns of association among infants and adults. Results showed that after the introduction, the silverback male spent >60% of his time in close proximity to an infant and 10% of his time within a ""cluster"" of infants. There was a significant,change in a female's nearest-neighbor associations; however, the change did not include an infant. The most significant finding among infants was a strong bias by each to associate with another infant. When the infants associated with an adult, three of the five associated most with the silverback male (P < 0.001), whereas the other two infants distributed their time among all the adults. The most significant change in behavior patterns was exhibited by one of the sub-adult females who displayed parental behaviors 18% of the time compared to <1% for all other females. Adults and one sub-adult female associated significantly more often with related infants compared to unrelated infants (P < 0.025), and the infants showed a bias to associate with another related infant (P < 0.0001). Results of an infant's association with an adult showed that three of the five infants preferred to associate with a related adult (P < 0.0001). An individual's age, sex, and behavioral profile may have also influenced association patterns among group members. These findings lend strong support to the importance of peer groups and the presence of a silverback male for facilitating the integration of hand-reared infants into established adult groups.

Orally delivered, transmucosally absorbed opioids have been shown to be a non-stressful alternative method of pre-anesthetic drug administration in children and adults [Stanley et al., 1989]. This report describes several cases using transmucosal carfentanil in non-human primates to determine whether orally delivered carfentanil can be a safe, less stressful, and reversible method of sedation in these species. Regimen 1: Transmucosal carfentanil alone. Three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), two capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella), and two gibbons (Hylobates lar) were given carfentanil citrate as their sole pre-medication agent. Doses ranged from 2.0 to 4.0 mu g/kg. After a median time of 22 minutes, all chimpanzees were nearly or completely immobilized and showed signs of severe respiratory depression. In contrast, the gibbons and capuchins showed moderate to profound sedation and no signs of respiratory depression. Regimen 2: Oral droperidol followed by transmucosal carfentanil. Four chimpanzees and two bonobos (Pan paniscus) were given a dose of 2.5 mg droperidol orally 45 minutes before transmucosal carfentanil administration. Two chimpanzees received 1.0 mu g/kg carfentanil, and all other animals in this trial received a dose of 2.0 mu g/kg. All individuals were nearly or completely immobilized with this protocol, and respiratory depression was much less severe. Regimen 3: Oral droperidol followed by transmucosal carfentanil for euthanasia. Two western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) were electively euthanized using oral droperidol followed by transmucosal carfentanil. Droperidol was administered as in Regimen 2, and doses of carfentanil were 14 mu g/kg in the case of a developmentally disabled young gorilla, and 2 mu g/kg for a severely debilitated geriatric gorilla with severe respiratory and cardiac disease. Respiratory arrest occurred at 12 and 10 minutes, respectively after carfentanil administration, with subsequent cardiac arrest. Transmucosal carfentanil appears promising as an anesthetic agent when administered alone to gibbons and capuchin monkeys, when administered in combination with droperidol to chimpanzees and bonobos, and when administered for purposes of elective euthanasia in gorillas. Administration of transmucosal carfentanil alone for immobilization of chimpanzees is not recommended because of the severity of respiratory depression observed. Zoo Biol 18:397-402, 1999.

This ERV-9 LTR contains an unusual U3 enhancer region composed of 14 tandem repeats with recurrent GATA, CACCC, and CCAAT motifs. This LTR is conserved in human and gorilla, indicating its evolutionary stability in the genomes of the higher primates. In both recombinant constructs and the endogenous human genome, the LTR enhancer and promoter activate the transcription of cis-linked DNA preferentially in erythroid cells.

Seasonality in the ecology and life histories of mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei),"['Watts, DP']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1020366018187,DEC 1998,36,"The abundance of food, especially that of fruit and often that of young leaves, varies considerably over time for most primates. This variation can depend on or be independent of seasonality in rainfall. Mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) in the Virungas are exceptional: their habitat contains almost no edible fruit, and they mostly eat perennially available herbs and vines that are densely and evenly distributed in much of their habitat. Earlier studies documented little consistent temporal variation in mountain gorilla diets and habitat use, except for seasonal use of bamboo by some groups, and documented no birth seasonality. Long-term data (less than or equal to 7 years) on 6 mountain gorilla groups confirm these results for habitat use, except that they show some seasonality in use of the upper altitudinal extremes of the gorillas' home ranges for unclear reasons. Relatively low and inconsistent variation in habitat duality over time should lower the costs of grouping for gorillas compared to other apes. Long-term data also confirm the absence of seasonality in births and conceptions. However, they show that mortality rates and risk of respiratory infections vary directly with rainfall. These relationships are probably causal and may be mediated through thermoregulatory stress."
The influence of alveolar structures on the torsional strain field in a gorilla corporeal cross-section,"['Chen, XB', 'Chen, H']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1998.0251,DEC 1998,13,"Anthropologists have often used mandibular torsional properties to make inferences about primate dietary adaptations. Most of the methods employed are based on assumptions related to periodontal and alveolar properties. This study uses the finite element method to evaluate some of these assumptions with a cross-section through the third molar of a gorilla. Results indicate that the properties of alveolar bone play an important role in determining the strain field. In comparison, the exact stiffness values of the periodontal ligaments seem to have a much smaller impact. Replacing the dental roots and periodontal ligaments with alveolar bone, however, has a significant influence on the strain field. It underestimates the maximum shear strain by about 28% along its periosteal aspect when alveoli are modeled as cortical bone. It overestimates the strain by a smaller amount when alveoli are modeled as trabecular bone.

This study supports the assumption that primate mandibles behave like a closed-section under torsion under the limiting condition that the alveolar bone stiffness is more than half of the value of cortical bone; alveolar bone can then be modeled as cortical bone with a minimal loss of accuracy. In addition, this study suggests that the minimum cortical thickness should be considered fbr torsional strength. Finally, modeling accuracy can be significantly increased if both dental and periodontal structures can be realistically incorporated into mandibular biomechanical models. However, this may not be always feasible in studies of fossil. mandibles. This is due mainly to the difficulties involved in estimating alveolar bone densities and in distinguishing boundaries between cortical bone, alveolar bone, periodontal ligaments, and dental roots in fossil specimens.

Identification of evolutionarily invariant sequences in the protein C gene promoter,"['Spek, CA', 'Bertina, RM', 'Reitsma, PH']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/PL00006424,DEC 1998,5,"Recent studies on human protein C gene expression have revealed the presence of three transcription factor binding sites in close proximity to the transcription start site. Binding sites for the liver-enriched hepatocyte nuclear factors 1 and 3 (HNF-1 and HNF-3, respectively) are located immediately upstream of the transcription start site, whereas just downstream of the start site a presently unidentified transcription factor may bind. To identify other candidate transcription factor binding sites in the protein C promoter, we studied the promoter sequence identity in a number of evolutionarily close and more distant species: Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, Pan troglodytes, Homo sapiens, Cebus apella, Macaca mulatta, Callithrix jacchus, Papio hamadryas, Macaca fascicularis, and Rattus norvegicus. This analysis showed that a high degree of identity (78%) exists among the different primates. Comparison of the primate consensus sequence with the Rattus norvegicus protein C promoter sequence revealed the presence of seven identical regions (I to VII). Two of these regions overlap with established regulatory sequences for HNF-3 and HNF-1 (region VI) and for PCE-1 (region VII), respectively. The functional importance and the transcription factors that may bind to the other five identical regions are now to be determined."
Analysis of urine from free-ranging mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) for normal physiologic values,"['Sleeman, JM', 'Mudakikwa, AB']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,DEC 1998,6,Voided urine samples were collected from apparently healthy free-living mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) and analyzed for normal physiologic values. Mountain gorillas were found to have a high urinary pH (x = 8.45) and low specific gravity (x = 1.013). Commercial dipsticks appear to be unreliable for the measurement of specific gravity and leukocytes. The establishment of urinary reference intervals should aid in the noninvasive detection of certain diseases in the mountain gorilla and assist with prompt and effective decisions regarding the immobilization and treatment of individual gorillas.
HLA-H: A pseudogene with increased variation due to balancing selection at neighboring loci,"['Grimsley, C', 'Mather, KA', 'Ober, C']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,DEC 1998,32,"The HLA complex includes the most polymorphic genes in the human genome. However, the HLA class Ib loci have little, if any, nucleotide variation, presumably due to their specialized functions or perhaps due to a lack of function. This population genetic study of HLA-H, a class I pseudogene, was initiated to determine the pattern of variation at neutral sites within the HLA complex. We found that the pattern of variation for HLA-H is consistent with the neutral model. However, the amount of variation in HLA-H is significantly greater than estimates for other silent sites within the human genome outside of the MHC (theta = 0.0144, P < 0.000001). Our study further indicates that other possible causes of increased variation such as a high mutation rate for HLA-H, interlocus gene conversion, increased diversity in the sample population in general, and selection acting directly on HLA-H are unlikely. Instead, these data suggest that HLA-H has increased variation as a result of balancing selection acting on nearby loci such as HLA-A."
Evolution of RPS4Y,"['Bergen, AW', 'Pratt, M', 'Mehlman, PT', 'Goldman, D', 'PSEUDOAUTOSOMAL BOUNDARY']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,NOV 1998,7,"Sequence variation within RPS4Y, a ribosomal protein gene located in the nonpseudoautosomal region of the Y chromosome, was used to elucidate the origin of this gene in primates. Complete coding and additional flanking sequences (949 bp) of the RPS4Y locus were determined in four nonhuman primate species. Phylogenetic reconstruction of RPS4 sequence evolution supports the monophyly of mammalian RPS4 and RPS4Y. Molecular evolutionary rate estimation reveals significantly elevated rates of DNA and protein evolution in RPS4Y compared with its X-chromosome homologs. These rates enable us to estimate the timing of the transposition of RPS4X to the Y chromosome (95% confidence interval, 32 MYA-74 MYA), and this estimate was verified by Southern hybridization analysis of prosimian and simian genomic DNA. These data support a transposition event of ancestral primate RPS4X to the Y chromosome prior to the divergence of Prosimii."
Preponderance of slightly deleterious polymorphism in mitochondrial DNA: Nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio is much higher within species than between species,"['Hasegawa, M', 'Cao, Y', 'Yang, ZH']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,NOV 1998,99,"We estimated synonymous (d(N)) and nonsynonymous (d(S)) substitution rates for protein-coding genes of the mitochondrial genome from two individuals each of the species human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. The genes were analyzed both separately and in a combined data set. Pairwise sequence comparisons suggest that the d(N)/d(S) rate ratios are about 5-10 times higher in within-species comparisons than in between-species comparisons. This result is confirmed by a more rigorous likelihood ratio test, which rejected the null hypothesis that the d(N)/d(S) rate ratios are identical within and between species. The Likelihood models account for the genetic code structure, transition/transversion rate ratio, and codon usage bias and are expected to produce more reliable results than the commonly used contingency test. Separate analyses of different genes show that the d(N)/d(S) rate ratios are higher within species than between species for all 13 mitochondrial genes, with the difference being statistically significant for all except three small or slowly evolving genes. Furthermore, in conserved genes, nonsynonymous rates within species tend to be higher than the between-species rates by a greater proportion than in fast-changing genes. Our findings confirm and extend earlier results obtained from smaller data sets and suggest the operation of slightly deleterious mutations throughout the mitochondrial genome in the hominoids. Implications of the results for evolutionary studies and, in particular, for studies of the origin of modern humans, are discussed."

This peptide binds with high affinity and accounts for almost all of the peptides associated with this molecule. Human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-E, a homologue of Qa-1(b), binds similar peptides derived from human class Ia molecules and interacts with CD94/NKG2 receptors on natural killer cells. We used surface plasmon resonance to determine the ability of Qa-1(b) to bind related ligands representing peptides derived from the leaders of class I molecules from several mammalian species. All of the peptides reported to bind HLA-E bound readily to Qa-1(b). In addition, peptides derived from leader segments of different mammals also bound to Qa-1(b), indicating a conservation of this ""Qdm-like"" epitope throughout mammalian evolution. We have attempted to define a minimal peptide on a polyglycine backbone that binds Qa-1(b). Our previous findings showed that P2 and P9 are important but not sufficient for binding to Qa-1(b). Although a minimum peptide (GMGGGGLLL) bound Qa-1(b), its interaction was relatively weak, as were peptides sharing five or six residues with Qdm, indicating that multiple native residues are required for a strong interaction. This finding is consistent with the observation that this molecule preferentially binds this single ligand."

Such studies have offered but a limited glimpse at differences in occlusal relief among taxa. Such differences in dental topography may relate to tooth function and, so, have considerable implications for the inference of diet from fossil teeth. In this article, we describe a technique to model and compare primate molars in three dimensions using Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) software. We examine unworn lower second molars of three extant hominoids with known differences in diet (Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Pongo pygmaeus), and two fossil forms, (Afropithecus turkanesis and Dryopithecus laietanus). First, we obtained approximately 400 landmarks on the occlusal surfaces of each tooth using an electromagnetic digitizer. Raster ""terrain models"" of occlusal surfaces were then created by interpolation of the coordinate data. We used GRASS terrain analysis automated techniques to quantify the volumes and slopes of individual cusps. We also used the GRASS watershed technique to identify the volume of liquid that would accumulate in each tooth's basin (a measure of basin area), and the directions and intensity of drainage over the occlusal surface. In sum, GRASS shows considerable potential for the characterization and comparison of tooth surfaces. Furthermore, techniques described here are not limited to the study of teeth, but may be broadly applicable to studies of skulls, joints, and other biological structures. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Interspecies comparative genome hybridization (CGH), used here in this study, between human, gorilla and pygmy chimpanzee revealed species-specific regions in all three species. In contrast to the human, a far more complex distribution of species-specific blocks was detected with CGH in gorilla and pygmy chimpanzee. Most of these blocks coincide with already described heterochromatic regions on gorilla and chimpanzee chromosomes. Representational difference analysis (RDA) was used to subtract the complex genome of gorilla against human in order to enrich gorilla-specific DNA sequences. Gorilla-specific clones isolated with this technique revealed a 32-bp repeat unit. These clones were mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to the telomeric regions of gorilla chromosomes that had been shown by interspecies CGH to contain species-specific sequences."
Spontaneous cleft palate in a newborn gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Siebert, JR', 'Williams, B', 'Collins, D', 'Winkler, LA', 'Swindler, DR']",CLEFT PALATE-CRANIOFACIAL JOURNAL,10.1597/1545-1569(1998)035<0436:SCPIAN>2.3.CO;2,SEP 1998,5,"Objective: We report the first case of cleft palate in a newborn male gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla).

Case History and Results: The full-term infant was born to clinically healthy, wild-caught parents and survived 5 days. Autopsy disclosed a unilateral cleft palate, moderate scalp hemorrhage (birth versus postnatal trauma), cerebral edema, and a sterile fibrin vegetation in the heart. The palate was also shorter and narrower than expected, and the biorbital breadth was reduced; otherwise, growth and development appeared normal, Standard cranial and intraoral radiographs and three-dimensional reconstructions of computerized tomographic (CT) scans provided thorough and noninvasive methods of studying the craniofacial complex and extracranial skeleton. By this technique, major findings were: intact premaxilla, interpremaxillary, and premaxillary/maxillary sutures; intramaxillary cleft with ipsilateral choanal atresia; mildly asymmetric inferior turbinates; and normal nasal septum and vomer.

Conclusions: Except for choanal atresia, cleft palate was not associated with other major craniofacial or extracranial anomalies in this case. Choanal atresia has been observed at times with cleft palate, but to our knowledge, the association has not been reported in nonhuman primates. Cleft palate, with or without cleft lip, has been recognized in a variety of nonhuman primates, including the lemur, marmoset, tamarin, squirrel monkey, and macaque. Some occurrences are spontaneous, while others are syndromic and/or arise from genetic or teratogenic influences. Each mode of presentation is poorly understood in nonhuman primates, but in this case, the absence of relevant environmental or parental history suggests that the occurrence was spontaneous. Anatomic studies of nonhuman primates are particularly valuable when they involve endangered species and will hopefully increase our understanding of the pathogenesis and etiology of congenital disorders, as well as other relationships between nonhuman primates and humans."

To date, no evidence has pinpointed the beta(2)m-specific amino acids that play an integral role in affecting structure in and around the peptide binding region of class I. To delineate beta(2)m amino acid positions that affect the alpha-1 helical region, we generated a series of mutant beta(2)m proteins bearing precise amino acid substitutions. The amino acid positions chosen were based upon previous results which demonstrated that human beta(2)m association with H2-L-d altered the structure of the alpha-1/alpha-2 super-domain. beta(2)m mutant proteins were used in beta(2)m exchange assays with cells expressing H2-Ld. Following exchange, cells were assayed to determine whether mutant beta(2)m association resulted in structural alteration of class I extracellular domains. The alteration in H2-L-d structure was evidenced by an increase in the binding of an antibody (34-1-2), specific for the alpha-1 helical region of H2-L-d. Results demonstrated that amino acid substitutions in beta(2)m positions 33 and 53 led to a dramatic increase in the reactivity of the alpha-1 domain-specific antibody 34-1-2. Identifying beta(2)m amino acid positions that influence the structure of the peptide binding region may allow for a better understanding of cellular immune responses that center upon class I/beta(2)m expression."

Here we analyzed the region surrounding the LRE1 locus in humans and gorillas to determine the evolutionary history of the region and to estimate the age of L1.2. We found that the region was composed of an ancient L1, L1Hs-Lrg, which was significantly divergent from all other L1 sequences available in the databases. We also determined that L1.2 was absent from the gorilla genome and arose in humans after the divergence of gorilla and human Lineages. Ln the gorilla LRE1 region, we discovered a different full-length L1 element, L1Gg-1, which was allelic and present at a high gene frequency in gorillas but absent from other primates. We determined the nucleotide sequence of L1Gg-1 and found that it was 98% identical to L1.2, suggesting a close relationship between active L1s in gorillas and humans."
Protein deficiency in a colony of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla),"['Mundy, NI', 'Ancrenaz, M', 'Wickings, EJ', 'Lunn, PG']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,SEP 1998,11,"A syndrome of alopecia and weight loss in a colony of 10 western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Gabon during a 3-yr period was apparently due to a dietary protein deficiency, with nine individuals affected to some extent. The most severely afflicted was a 4-yr-old female who eventually died as a result of acute gastroenteritis caused by Shigella flexneri. Clinical signs included chronic alopecia, hair discoloration, failure to thrive, and weight loss, and their severity was directly correlated with the degree of hypoalbuminemia (12 g/L in the most extreme case) and normocytic normochromic anemia. Preliminary clinical tests and autopsy results suggested a dietary protein or amino acid deficiency as the cause of the hypoalbuminemia, and further analyses of serum amino acid and protein levels were consistent with a diagnosis of dietary protein deficiency. Supplementation of the colony diet with a protein preparation for humans produced a rapid amelioration of signs and improvement in body and coat condition, a normalization of serum albumin and total protein levels, and disappearance of the anemia in all affected animals except a 12-yr-old male, who responded well to treatment with anabolic steroids. The natural diet of western lowland gorillas is surprisingly high in protein, and the dietary protein requirement bf captive gorillas may be increased as a result of the absence of commensal gastrointestinal ciliates."

Whilst the beta subunit is apparently testis-specific, the finding of low levels of fertilin alpha in nonreproductive tissues has cast some doubt on a unique role in fertilisation. Moreover, the absence of a functional fertilin alpha gene in the human would imply that this gene product is not absolutely essential for fertilisation, although it could play a facilitatory role. We now describe the organisation and sequence of the fertilin alpha genes in a range of primates, including the great apes, and find that the gorilla gene, like that of the human, is non-functional.

The PT was measured in both the sagittal and coronal planes by use of multiplanar reformatting software. The PT could only be identified in the sample of great apes and not in the remaining non-human primate species. Within the great ape sample, the PT was larger in the left hemisphere than in the right in a statistical majority of the subjects. These results are consistent with the notion that the PT evolved as a definable structure about 15 million years ago and may have arisen as a result for selection for greater cortical folding which in turn led to greater gyrification in larger brains.

Consistency, variation, and home range size and stability","['Watts, DP']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1020324909101,AUG 1998,48,"Mountain gorillas are highly folivorous. Food is abundant and perennially available in much of their habitat. Still, limited reseal ch has shown that single gorilla groups heavily used areas where food biomass and quality were relatively high and where they met daily nutritional needs with relatively low foraging effort. Also, ecological factors influenced solitary males less than groups with females. Long-term data on habitat use by multiple mountain gorilla social units and more extensive data on variation in food distribution presented here, confirm that food distribution influences areal occupation densities across groups and over time. These data also confirm the group/solitary male distinction and show that food distribution became more important for one male once he acquired females. Groups used less than or equal to 25 km(2), and inter-annual home range and core area overlap was often low. Annual home range and core area size varied considerably within groups and across years. It bore no simple relationship to group size and estimated group biomass. Core areas were biased samples of total home ranges and were relatively good foraging areas. One group abruptly shifted its home range in response to male mating competition. Home ranges of two others expanded from 1981 to 1987, though at a decreasing rate. Data on one such group, which varied considerably in size, are consistent with arguments that costs of scramble competition are low except in unusually large groups. Low site fidelity low scramble costs, and high home range overlap should decrease the ecological costs of female transfer."

Reuse of foraging areas in relation to resource abundance, quality, and depletion","['Watts, DP']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1020376925939,AUG 1998,28,"Resource depression caused by current feeding and the rate of resource renewal should influence foragers' decisions about when to revisit foraging areas. Adjustment of foraging paths and revisit rates should be particularly important when resources renew slowly. Foragers can also benefit by returning more often to highly profitable than to less profitable foraging areas. Many highly frugivorous primates seem to time revisits to fruit sources so as to harvest fruit efficiently and, also, use efficient search paths. Fewer data on non-frugivores exist. Mountain gorillas are folivores that eat mostly perennially available, continuously growing herbs and vines. Vegetation regenerates slowly from the effects of gorilla trampling, though trampling can also facilitate food species productivity, at least in the short term. Adjustment of intervals between visits to foraging areas to the extent of previous use and to resource renewal rates should increase gorilla foraging efficiency. Long-term data on habitat use by 6 mountain gorilla social units show that revisit intervals vary in association with variation in the extent of previous use and in plant productivity. However they also revisit areas more often, the higher the biomass and nutritional quality of food there. These data are generally consistent with the hypothesis that the gorillas crop resources on a sustained-yield basis, though more precise data on areal revisits and complementary long-term data on vegetation composition would be needed to test the hypothesis."

The determination of the piriform aperture index (breadth/height) allowed the authors to demonstrate a marked elongation of the aperture in Home compared with Gorilla and Pan. Individual characterization of the shape was possible with great precision and without ambiguity by using Fourier analysis. An absolute, interspecific partition between Gorilla, Pan, and Home resulted from the canonical discriminant analysis of the Fourier descriptors. However, a closeness of shape between some individuals in Pan and some in Gorilla and Home was observed, demonstrating a morphological continuum of the shape of the piriform aperture in hominoids: Pan was in intermediate position between Gorilla and Home. Interspecific differences between Home and the group Pan-Gorilla were explained principally by the differences in elongation (amplitude of the second harmonic) and pentagonality (amplitude of the fifth harmonic) and by differences in orientation of quadrangularity (phase of the fourth harmonic). Differences in the shape of the piriform aperture between Pan and Gorilla were explained by differences in orientation of elongation (phase of the second harmonic) and by differences in the component of triangularity (amplitude of the third harmonic). In Gorilla and Pan, the little, elongated, and relatively trapezoidal piriform aperture seems to be a shared primitive feature (plesiomorphic), whereas an elongated piriform aperture seems to be a characteristic and derived feature (apomorphic) of modern Home sapiens.

"Evolutionary divergence of the oncogenes GLI, HST and INT2","['Conte, RA', 'Samonte, RV', 'Verma, RS']",HEREDITY,NA,JUL 1998,1,"Almost a quarter of a century ago, the banding patterns of human and other higher primate chromosomes were compared, creating a barrage of speculation. Consequently, a number of approaches have been used to understand human descent. Chromosome modifications are believed to be important in the origin of species, and pericentric inversions account for the majority of evolutionary chromosomal alterations seen in Hominoidea. A comparative mapping fluorescence in situ hybridization technique, using locus-specific DNA probes as phylogenetic markers, was used to decipher the pericentric inversions of human chromosomes 11 and 12. Human-derived (Homo sapiens, HSA) DNA probes for GLI, HST and INT2 protooncogenes were used to identify their homologous locations in the chromosomes of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, PTR), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla, GGO) and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus, PPY). The INT2 and HST loci mapping results confirm the earlier putative claim that a pericentric inversion took place in HSA chromosome 11 and its equivalent PTR and GGO chromosomes. In addition, these data provide additional information regarding the orangutan's position on the evolutionary tree of Pongidae and Hominidae. GLI mapping reveals that a pericentric inversion occurred in the HSA chromosome 12 equivalent in PTR and GGO, but was not seen in HSA or PPY. These pericentric inversions in PTR and GGO may have occurred at a period when both PTR and GGO had branched off from the Hominoidae trunk. The use of loci-specific probes to decipher pericentric inversions has proved to be a formidable approach in characterizing chromosome rearrangements and providing further evidence on human descent."

This study concentrates on the subset of associated skeletons which preserve the reciprocal surfaces of a joint. It uses laser scanning to explore whether the shapes of the reciprocal surfaces of a joint of an individual are significantly more congruent than the surfaces of randomly-matched pairings taken from the same species. Laser scanning was used to capture the distal articular surface of the left tibia of OH35 and the trochlear articular surface of the talus of OH8, both from Bed I, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. The degree of congruency between those articular surfaces was tested against the congruency of the talocrural joint of AL 288-1 (Australopithecus afarensis), and the congruency of both associated and randomly-matched talocrural joints of modern humans, chimpanzees and gorillas. The results suggest that OH35 and OH8 do not come from the same individual and may not come from the same species. Although this analysis leaves open the taxonomic affinity of OH35, it demonstrates the potential of laser scanning for capturing 3D data in palaeoanthropology. It also demonstrates the potential for using the relative congruency of reciprocal joint surfaces as a test of the likelihood that isolated limb bones are components of a single individual."

Evidence from urinary cortisol that maternal behavior is related to stress in gorillas,"['Bahr, NI', 'Pryce, CR', 'Dobeli, M', 'Martin, RD']",PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR,10.1016/S0031-9384(98)00057-2,JUN 15 1998,54,"By studying western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla, n = 8) in zoological gardens via ethological and non-invasive physiological techniques, we have demonstrated that their postpartum maternal behavior is related negatively to their postpartum urinary titers of cortisol. On the basis of this finding, it is proposed that postpartum stress contributes to disrupted maternal behavior in the gorilla in captivity. Morning urine samples were collected with a mean sampling interval of 1.6 days from Day 14 prepartum to Day 14 postpartum (n = 11 pregnancies). Creatinine-indexed (Cr) urinary cortisol titers declined significantly between Day 9 to 1 prepartum (0.634 +/- 0.014 mu g/mg of Cr, mean +/- SEM) and Day 1 to 6 postpartum (0.396 +/- 0.030 mu g/mg of Cr, mean +/- SEM; p < 0.01-0.001). For each pregnancy, the relative postpartum decline in urinary cortisol was calculated as (mu g of cortisol/mg of Cr Day 1 to 4)/(mu g of cortisol/mg of Cr Day -4 to -1). Values ranged from 0.35 to 1.12, were independent of absolute prepartum cortisol titers, and were interpreted as evidence of inter-female differences in postpartum hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and, therefore, postpartum stress. This postpartum stress index was negatively correlated with the amount of time (0-100%) that females carried and supported their 0-14 day-old infants in a ventral position during locomotion (r(s) = -0.68, p < 0.05) and tended to be negatively correlated with the total amount of time (0-100%) they spent in ventro-ventral contact with their infants (r(s) = -0.58; p < 0.10). This study provides the first physiological evidence that postpartum stress is an important etiologic factor in gorilla maternal failure in captive environments. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc."

We reported previously that the tandemly arrayed genes encoding U2 snRNA (the RNU2 locus) in humans and apes contain a solo LTR (U2-LTR) which was presumably generated by homologous recombination between the two LTRs of an ancestral provirus that is retained in the orthologous baboon RNU2 locus. We have now sequenced the orthologous U2-LTRs in human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and baboon and examined numerous homologs of the U2-LTR that are dispersed throughout the human genome. Although these U2-LTR homologs have been collectively referred to as LTR13 in the literature, they do not display sequence similarity to any known retroviral LTRs; however, the structure of LTR13 closely resembles that of other retroviral LTRs with a putative promoter, polyadenylation signal, and a tandemly repeated 53-bp enhancer-like element. Genomic blotting indicates that LTR13 is primate-specific; based on sequence analysis, we estimate there are about 2,500 LTR13 elements in the human genome. Comparison of the primate U2-LTR sequences suggests that the homologous recombination event that gave rise to the solo U2-LTR occurred soon after insertion of the ancestral provirus into the ancestral U2 tandem array. Phylogenetic analysis of the LTR13 family confirms that it is diverse, but the orthologous U2-LTRs form a coherent group in which chimpanzee is closest to the humans; orangutan is a clear outgroup of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla; and baboon is a distant relative of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. We compare the LTR13 family with other known LTRs and consider whether these LTRs might play a role in concerted evolution of the primate RNU2 locus."
Comparative study of the genomic organization of DNA repeats within the 5 '-flanking region of the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein gene (NRAMP1) between humans and great apes,"['Roger, M', 'Sanchez, FO', 'Schurr, E']",MAMMALIAN GENOME,10.1007/s003359900792,JUN 1998,3,"The human NRAMP1 gene located on Chromosome (Chr) region 2q35 is a candidate gene for increased risk of infection by several intracellular macrophage parasites, including M. tuberculosis and M, leprae. In search for a possible mutational hot spot, we have analyzed a 3.5-kb region 5' to NRAMP1 that is highly enriched for DNA repeat sequences. The repeat sequences could be grouped into one Mer element and six Alu elements, representing five Alu subfamilies, that had integrated in the same DNA region during successive rounds of Alu retropositional activity. Comparative sequence analysis of the Alu cluster region in humans, chimpanzee (Pan paniscus), and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) revealed only modest sequence variability and failed to detect any evidence for genomic instability of the highly repetitive DNA region. These results show that sequence length variants in the Alu-flanking regions as well as nucleotide substitutions are the most common genomic variations even in a region of extreme Alu-clustering. Moreover, the high degree of sequence conservation among three primate species argues against the Alu cluster being the site of frequent genomic rearrangements or other frequent genetic events that might influence NRAMP1 expression."
The hypoglossal canal and the origin of human vocal behavior,"['Kay, RF', 'Cartmill, M', 'Balow, M']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.95.9.5417,APR 28 1998,66,"The mammalian hypoglossal canal transmits the nerve that supplies the muscles of the tongue, This canal is absolutely and relatively larger in modern humans than it is in the African apes (Pan and Gorilla). We hypothesize that the human tongue is supplied more richly with motor nerves than are those of living apes and propose that canal size in fossil hominids may provide an indication about the motor coordination of the tongue and reflect the evolution of speech and language. Canals of gracile Australopithecus, and possibly Homo habilis, fall within the range of extant Pan and are significantly smaller than those of modern Homo, The canals of Neanderthals and an early ""modern"" Homo sapiens (Skhul 5), as well as of African and European middle Pleistocene Home (Kabwe and Swanscombe), fall within the range of extant Home and are significantly larger than those of Pan troglodytes, These anatomical findings suggest that the vocal capabilities of Neanderthals were the same as those of humans today. Furthermore, the vocal abilities of Australopithecus were not advanced significantly over those of chimpanzees whereas those of Home may have been essentially modern by at least 400,000 years ago. Thus, human vocal abilities may have appeared much earlier in time than the first archaeological evidence for symbolic behavior."
Statistical analysis of shape through triangulation of landmarks: A study of sexual dimorphism in hominids,"['Rao, CR', 'Suryawanshi, S']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.95.8.4121,APR 14 1998,22,"Two objects with homologous landmarks are said to be of the same shape if the configuration of landmarks of one object can be exactly matched with that of the other by translation, rotation/reflection, and scaling. In an earlier paper, the authors proposed statistical analysis of shape by considering logarithmic differences of all possible Euclidean distances between landmarks. Tests of significance for differences in the shape of objects and methods of discrimination between populations were developed with such data. In the present paper, the corresponding statistical methodology is developed by triangulation of the landmarks and by considering the angles as natural measurements of shape. This method is applied to the study of sexual dimorphism in hominids."
Comparative mapping of the cri du chat and DiGeorge syndrome regions in the great apes,"['Tarazami, ST', 'Kringstein, AM', 'Conte, RA', 'Verma, RS']",GENES & GENETIC SYSTEMS,10.1266/ggs.73.135,APR 1998,1,"Structural variations between great ape and human chromosomes due to pericentric inversions and translocations have created at apparent controversy during the reconstruction of hominoid phylogeny. One such variation involves human chromosome 5, which is equivalent to chromosome 4 in chimpanzee and orangutan but equivalent to segments of chromosomes 4 and 19 in gorilla. Obviously, neither banding patterns nor centromeric indecies in these chromosomes match. The pathological condition of cri du chat syndrome is due to the cytogenetic deletion of band p15.2 of chromosome 5. Is this region involved during pericentric inversion of apes chromsome 4? We used a human cosmid probe for cri du chat syndrome as a phylogenetic marker in search of the aforementioned question. The genomic sequences for cri du chat syndrome region were conserved in chimpanzee (PTR4) and orangutan (PPY4) but displayed a positional divergence in gorilla on chromosome 19(GGO19). In addition, we used a human cosmid DNA probe for DiGeorge syndrome which is located on chromosome 22 band q11.2 and was conserved within band 23q11.2 in apes. The loci specific human genomic probes may help to describe the inversions and translocations for other chromsomes."

The survey included a total of 480 km of transects completed within seven sampling zones in the Kahuzi-Biega National park lowland sector and adjacent Kasese regions and approximately 1100 km of footpath and forest reconnaissance. We estimate total populations of 7670 (4180-10,830) weaned gorillas within the Kahuzi-Biega lowland sector and 3350 (1420-5950) individuals in the Kasese survey areas. Within the same area, we estimate a population of 2600 (1620-4500) chimpanzees. Ape nest site densities are significantly higher within the Kahuzi-Biega lowland sector than in the more remote Kasese survey area in spite of a significantly higher encounter rate of human sign within the lowland sector of the park. Comparison of our data with information obtained by Emlen and Schaller during the first rangewide survey of Grauer's gorillas in 1959 suggests that gorilla populations have remained stable in protected areas but declined in adjacent forest. These findings underscore the key role played by national parks in protecting biological resources in spite of the recent political and economic turmoil in the region. We also show that forest reconnaissance is a reliable and cost-effective method to assess gorilla densities in remote forested areas."
Origin of human chromosome 2 revisited,"['Samonte, RV', 'Ramesh, KH', 'Verma, RS']",JOURNAL OF GENETICS,10.1007/BF02933040,APR 1998,1,"Similarities in chromosome banding patterns and homologies in DNA sequence between chromosomes of the great apes and humans have suggested that human chromosome 2 originated through the fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes. A lot of work has been directed at understanding the nature and mechanism of this fusion. The recent availability of the human chromosome-2-specific alpha satellite DNA probe D2Z and the human chromosome-2p-specific subtelomeric DNA probe D2S445 prompted us to attempt cross-hybridization with chromosomes of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) to search for equivalent locations in the great apes and to comment on the origin of human chromosome 2. The probes gave different results. No hybridization to the chromosome-2-specific alpha satellite DNA probe was observed on the presumed homologous great ape chromosomes using both high-stringency and low-stringency post-hybridization washes, whereas the subtelomeric-DNA probe specific for chromosome 2p hybridized to telomeric sites of the short arm of chromosome 12 of all three great apes. These observations suggest an evolutionary difference in the number of alpha satellite DPI;A repeat units in the equivalent ape chromosomes presumably involved in the chromosome fusion. Nevertheless, complete conservation of DNA sequence of the subtelomeric repeat sequence D2S445 in the ape chromosomes is demonstrated."
Estimation of African ape body length from femur length,"['Hens, SM', 'Konigsberg, LW', 'Jungers, WL', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1997.0209,APR 1998,12,"The estimation from long bone lengths of stature in humans or body size in apes has a deep history in physical anthropology. To date, we can enumerate at least five different statistical methods for making such estimations. These methods are: (1) the regression of body length on long bone length (inverse calibration), (2) regression of long bone length on body length followed by solving for body length (classical calibration), (3) major axis regression of body length on long bone length, (4) reduced major axis regression of body length on long bone length, and (5) use of a long bone/body length ratio. We examine some of the statistical properties of these estimators using a large sample of humans (n=2053) to derive the estimators, and applying them to smaller samples of Pan troglodytes (n=42), Pan paniscus (n=8), and Gorilla gorilla (n=35).

Based on the root mean-squared error (RMSE), the reduced major axis is the preferred estimator for body length in the combined Pan sample. However, inverse calibration is the best estimator for body length in gorillas based on the RMSE. Many estimators grossly underestimate body length in the apes. Differences in allometries between humans and great apes are obvious, but it is important to show the assumptions necessary in estimating body size from fossil remains, especially when isolated long bones are recovered and the global allometry is consequently unknown.

The authors divide the range of Grauer's gorilla into four regions within which they identify 11 populations and estimate a total of c. 16,900 individuals. Gorillas found in the Kahuzi-Biega lowland-Kasese represent 86 per cent of the subspecies's total population. Further, approximately 67 per cent of known Grauer's gorillas inhabit Kahuzi-Biega, Maiko and Virunga National Parks. The eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) has an extremely high human population growth rate indicating that deforestation and wildlife use trends will continue to increase. Thus, in spite of the encouraging results of surveys to identify populations and characterize abundance, no Grauer's gorilla population should be considered safe from extirpation."
Paternity determination in captive lowland gorillas and orangutans and wild mountain gorillas by microsatellite analysis,"['Field, D', 'Chemnick, L', 'Robbins, M', 'Garner, K', 'Ryder, O']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557731,APR 1998,18,"Paternity exclusion studies provide useful information for testing certain theories of behavioral ecology and for the management and conservation of both wild and captive populations of endangered species. This study used eight human nuclear microsatellite loci, in the absence of species-specific PCR primers, to genetically identify the sires of 12 captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and 2 captive orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus and Pongo p. abelii). Parentage assignments were confirmed by excluding all except a single potential sire for each offspring with at least two loci. Sire-offspring relationships were verified in 12 of the 14 cases, and reassigned in the case of two gorilla offspring. The orangutan paternity typing was supplemented by DNA fingerprinting. Additionally, five of the eight microsatellite loci, in conjunction with behavioral data, were used for a non-exhaustive set of paternity exclusions for five wild mountain gorillas (Gorilla g. beringei). The eight loci described in this study should be useful additions to the tools available for the study of genetics in the great apes."
Mitochondrial DNA variability in Grauer's gorillas of Kahuzi-Biega National Park,"['Saltonstall, K', 'Amato, G', 'Powell, J']",JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,10.1093/jhered/89.2.129,MAR-APR 1998,22,"Eastern lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla graueri) are the least studied of the three gorilla subspecies, particularly at the molecular level. We sequenced an internal region of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) region and a hypervariable portion of the mitochondrial DNA control region (D-loop) from wild gorillas in both the montane and lowland habitats of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, Democratic Republic of Congo, All individuals (n = 38) were identical at the COII region; this sequence indicates that diagnostic sites previously suggested for gorilla subspecies may be valid. Low variability was found within the D-loop region from a subset of the individuals (n = 15) sequenced for COII. Haplotype frequencies differed between the two habitats, suggesting a level of population subdivision that may have demographic consequences. These results also support the distinction of two distinct clades of gorillas comprised of western populations (G, g. gorilla) and eastern populations (G. g. graueri and G. g. beringei). Future management of Kahuzi-Biega National Park should ensure that sufficient habitat remains to prevent further genetic isolation of gorillas in the montane section of the park."
Human endogenous retrovirus K homologous sequences and their coding capacity in old world primates,"['Mayer, J', 'Meese, E', 'Mueller-Lantzsch, N']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,NA,MAR 1998,30,"The coding capacity for retroviral Gag and Env proteins has been maintained in human endogenous retroviruses of the HERV-K family. HERV-K homologous sequences have been found in all Old world primates, Here, we examined Old World primate species for the presence of full-length HERV-K gag and env genes and the presence of gag and env open reading frames as determined by the protein truncation test. Full-length HERV-K env genes were found in DNAs of all Old World primate species, whereas open reading frames for Env protein were found solely in human, chimpanzee; and gorilla DNAs. The mutational event leading to two HERV-K types was found to have occurred after the separation of hominids from lower Old World primates and before the expansion of hominids. Full length HERV-K gag genes in hominids displayed a 96-bp deletion compared to those in lon-er Old World primates. The ancient gag variant has not been maintained during hominid evolution. Open reading frames for HERV-K Gag have been found in all Old World primates except chimpanzees. Our study of the HERV-K family during Old World primate evolution contributes to the understanding of their possible biological functions in the host genomes."

Differences in free AA between three types of human milk were small. Milks of pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) contained the highest levels of total free AA (8634-20862 mu mol/l), while the milks of cows and sheep had the lowest levels of total free AA (1061-1357 mu mol/l). The milks of human subjects, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), elephants (Elephas maximus), horses and pigs had intermediate levels of total free AA (3069-7381 mu mol/l).

Taurine was the second most abundant free AA in milks of human subjects and non-human primates, while histidine was the second most abundant free AA in milks of pinnipeds.

Secnidazole vs. paromomycin: Comparative antiprotozoan treatment in captive primates,"['Gracenea, M', 'Gomez, MS', 'Fernandez, J', 'Feliu, C']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,NA,FEB 1998,3,"The antiprotozoan activity of secnidazole was studied in Cercocebus t. torquatus, Cercopithecus campbelli, Erythrocebus patas (Cercopithecidae), and Gorilla gorilla (Pongidae) compared with that of paromomycin in Cercocebus t. lunulatus (Cercopithecidae), E. paras, and G. gorilla (Pongidae) by coprological analysis. The antiprotozoan activity of both drugs depended on the parasite species and the host species. The drugs acted in a similar way on Entamoeba coli parasitising C. t. torquatus, and E. paras.

Design-Prospective study.

Animals-5 adult male lowland gorillas from 11 to 18 years old.

Procedure-A complete cardiac evaluation was performed on anesthetized gorillas, including physical examination, thoracic radiography, electrocardiography, echocardiography, blood pressure determination, CBC, serum biochemical analyses, and serologic assay for viral diseases. Standard cardiac measurements were made from images collected during ultrasonography.

Results-Cardiac measurements derived from ultrasonographic images were consistent with those considered normal in human beings. Results of other diagnostic tests were also considered normal.

Clinical Implications-Cardiac disease is the primary cause of mortality in old captive gorillas. The technique used here provided excellent evaluation of cardiac function. Use of these techniques will allow early detection of cardiac disease, making treatment or medical management possible."
Evolutionary sequence comparisons using high-density oligonucleotide arrays,"['Hacia, JG', 'Makalowski, W', 'Edgemon, K', 'Erdos, MR', 'Robbins, CM', 'Fodor, SPA', 'Brody, LC', 'Collins, FS']",NATURE GENETICS,10.1038/ng0298-155,FEB 1998,83,"We explored the utility of high-density oligonucleotide arrays (DNA chips) for obtaining sequence information from homologous genes in closely related species. Orthologues of the human BRCA1 exon 11, all approximately 3.4 kb in length and ranging from 98.2% to 83.5% nucleotide identity, were subjected to hybridization-based and conventional dideoxysequencing analysis. Retrospective guidelines for identifying high-fidelity hybridization-based sequence calls were formulated based upon dideoxysequencing results. Prospective application of these rules yielded base-calling with at least 98.8% accuracy over orthologous sequence tracts shown to have approximately 99% identity. For higher primate sequences with greater than 97% nucleotide identity, base-calling was made with at least 99.91% accuracy covering a minimum of 97% of the sequence. Using a second-tier confirmatory hybridization chip strategy, shown in several cases to confirm the identity of predicted sequence changes, the complete sequence of the chimpanzee. gorilla and orangutan orthologues should be deducible solely through hybridization-based methodologies. Analysis of less highly conserved orthologues can still identify conserved nucleotide tracts of at least 15 nucleotides and can provide useful information for designing primers. DNA-chip based assays can be a valuable new technology for obtaining high-throughput cost-effective sequence information from related genomes."
Allelic diversity at the primate MHC-DMB locus: presence of a conserved tyrosine inhibitory motif in the cytoplasmic tail,"['Alvarez, M', 'Recio, MJ', 'Martinez-Laso, J', 'Perez-Blas, M', 'Garcia-de-la-Torre, C', 'Vargas-Alarcon, G', 'Alegre, R', 'Gomez-Casado, E', 'Arnaiz-Villena, A']",TISSUE ANTIGENS,NA,FEB 1998,2,"Ten new primate Mhc-DMB complete cDNA sequences have been obtained in chimpanzee (n=four), gorilla (,n=three) and orangutan (n=three); this gene has not been previously studied in these species, Exonic allelism has been recorded all along the molecule domains and also in the leader peptide, but not in the transmembrane segment. An analysis of the residues critical in the conformation of the Mhc-DR peptide-binding site was done in order to look for a Mhc-DR homologue site; synonymous substitutions are favoured in this homologous HLA-DM region. This is another finding that supports the possibility that DM could not be typically pn presenting molecules. The immunoreceptor inhibition motif Tyr 230-Thr/Ser 231-Pro 232-Leu 233 (ITIM) is invariantly present in apes for at least 15 million years, and may have a double function: 1) To direct DMB-DMA molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum or cell surface towards the endosomal/lysosomal class II compartment and 2) to send an inhibitory signal to the cell in order to stop synthesis of unnecessary HLA-DR molecules, once all available antigenic peptides are loaded. Other molecules, like NK-cell receptors and Fc receptors, bear this type of tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in order to switch off specific cell functions. DMB molecules (as previously shown in C4d molecules) do not present species-specific motifs in common chimpanzee, suggesting that this species is very close to gorilla or man, also, DMB, like C4d molecules, do not show a trans-species evolution pattern, suggesting the existence of extensive homogenization of DMB genes within each species or a recent generation of alleles. Finally, a clade grouping human and gorilla DMB cDNA sequences is obtained using a dendrogram (as for C4d nees); this is in contrast to others' results that obtain a human/chimpanzee clade using different DNA sequences."
Lowland gorillas and seed dispersal: The importance of nest sites,"['Rogers, ME', 'Voysey, BC', 'McDonald, KE', 'Parnell, RJ', 'Tutin, CEG']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1098-2345(1998)45:1<45::AID-AJP5>3.0.CO;2-W,1998,40,"Lowland gorillas eat the fruit and disperse the seeds of many tree species in the Lope Reserve, Gabon. This study aimed to show whether deposition of seeds at gorilla ground nest sites conferred any advantage for germination and seedling establishment as compared to the fate of seeds deposited in gorilla dung on trails or under parents, Four tree species were chosen for study, which had a range of fruit types and fruiting patterns but which were all important foods for gorillas. Data showed that gorillas removed significant quantities of seeds from all four species and deposited them in dung at nest sites or on trail. Nest sites were not always favorable for germination, but the most favorable sites permitted the best survival and growth of any of the seedlings, including those deposited in dung on trail or scatter-dispersed under or away from parent canopies. Initial performance in the first few weeks after deposition was not always indicative of long-term survival and growth, so data collection over 1-2 years was absolutely essential. The main factors affecting seedling fate at nest sites appeared to be vegetation cover and desiccation. It is suggested that the nesting habits of gorillas are an additional factor encouraging the successful establishment of seedlings over and above the obvious advantages of large body size, gut capacity, and extended day ranges.

Orthologous regions were found by FISH analysis of metaphase chromosomes from Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Pongo pygmaeus. Only one orthologous region was detected in chromosomes of P.pygmaeus, showing that the original locus was at 21q22.1 and that the duplication arose after the separation of Asian orangutans from the other hominoids. Surprisingly, the paralogous regions were more highly conserved in gorilla than in chimpanzee. PCR amplification of STSs derived from sequences of the chromosome 21 loci and low-stringency FISH analysis showed that this duplication occurred recently in the evolution of the genome. Different rates of sequence evolution through substitutions or deletions, after the duplication, may have resulted in diversity between closely related primates."

Specific hybridization was constitutively seen on the short arms of gorilla acrocentric chromosome pairs 22 and 23, corresponding to human pairs 21 and 22. Only one specimen of western lowland gorilla investigated showed an additional hybridization site at the telomeric short arm of one chromosome 1, From our own results and those in the literature, it is clear that the additional rDNA site on chromosome 1 must be regarded as a rare polymorphism in the subspecies of western lowland gorilla, possibly going back to a founder translocation event."

Analyses of cross species polymerase chain reaction products to infer the ancestral state of human polymorphisms,"['Iyengar, S', 'Seaman, M', 'Deinard, AS', 'Rosenbaum, HC', 'Sirugo, G', 'Castiglione, CM', 'Kidd, JR', 'Kidd, KK']",DNA SEQUENCE,10.3109/10425179809034076,1998,30,"In numerous population genetic and disease association studies decisions about the ancestry of polymorphic alleles are often made based on the relative frequency of the alleles in the extant populations with the most frequent allele being deemed as ancestral. However, the frequency of an allele in a population is generally not a perfect indicator of its ancestral status. A more accurate method to assess ancestral/derived status of polymorphic alleles involves identification of shared alleles between species. We used this strategy to examine genomic regions homologous to several human polymorphisms in four species of non-human primates. Cross species polymerase chain reaction (CS-PCR), with primers designed from human sequence, was used to investigate regions of interest. Nineteen polymorphisms at six loci (DRD2, HOXB@, PAH, D4S10, RBP3 and RET) were examined either by restriction fragment length analysis of PCR products (PCR-RFLP) or by direct sequencing. At seventeen of the eighteen PCR-RFLPs, non-human primates were monomorphic and identical to each other for either lack of restriction enzyme site or presence of the site. Thus, at these seventeen polymorphic sites the shared alleles are most likely to be the ancestral ones in humans. In several cases we have used sequence data to further demonstrate that the nucleotide at the site of the polymorphism is conserved between species confirming the hypothesis of a single ancestral allele. However, not all human alleles can be simply resolved into ancestral and derived; sequence data from one PCR-RFLP (in an intron of the PAH locus) and a single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the DRD2 gene illustrate this point."

Characterization of chimpanzee TCRV gene polymorphism: how old are human TCRV alleles?,"['Jaeger, EEM', 'Bontrop, RE', 'Parham, P', 'Wickings, EJ', 'Kadwell, M', 'Lanchbury, JS']",IMMUNOGENETICS,NA,JAN 1998,10,"The functional relevance of the majority of human T-cell receptor A and B variable region gene polymorphisms is controversial. Studies of human and nonhuman primate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II polymorphisms show that allelic lineages predate human speciation and indicate that selection favors the long-term maintenance of these advantageous mutations. We investigated at the DNA level whether 15 human TCRA and B polymorphisms exist in contemporary chimpanzee populations. Polymorphisms consisted of variable region replacements, a recombination signal sequence base change, and silent mutations. With one exception, none of these human TCR polymorphisms were observed in contemporary chimpanzees. Investigation of the same polymorphisms in a range of other nonhuman primates showed little evidence of the existence of human polymorphism prespeciation. Chimpanzee TCRAV and BV regions were however polymorphic for variation so far not observed in human groups. Levels of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence variation in contemporary chimpanzees suggest that population bottlenecks have not been a feature of chimpanzee evolution and it is therefore probable that most human TCR polymorphisms have evolved in the estimated five million years since the speciation of human and chimpanzees. Thus, over the evolutionary time period studied, ancient TCRA and B polymorphisms have not been maintained by selection to the same degree as postulated for MHC polymorphisms."
Effects of selected behavioral enrichment devices on behavior of Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla).,"['Rooney, M B', 'Sleeman, J']",Journal of applied animal welfare science : JAAWS,10.1207/s15327604jaws0104_2,1998,8,"Environmental complexity plays an integral role in the activity and psychological well-being of primates. The experiment described in this article evaluates the effects of nonintrusive, inexpensive, and easily managed behavioral enrichment devices on the behavior of a group of captive Western lowland gorillas. Devices used included cardboard boxes containing food items, paper bags containing food items, burlap rags, and willow and maple browse. The enrichment devices increased foraging, social play, and solitary play behaviors. Sedentary behaviors decreased. Rags, bags, browse, and boxes did not statistically decrease the incidence of regurgitation/reingestation or coprophagy. Depending on the type of enrichment item used, the effects on agonism and manipulation of enrichment item were variable. To make informed management decisions about the psychological well-being of captive animals, it is important to objectively quantify and examine the influences on their behavior."
"Variation in tooth morphology of Gorilla gorilla
","['Uchida, A']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1997.0186,JAN 1998,36,"Gorilla gorilla exemplifies a species that shows considerable variation in habitat, behaviour, genetic structure and morphology. This study examines variation of dental morphology in gorillas. Despite the marked size dimorphism, there are no significant shape differences between the sexes within subspecies. Differences in dental morphology, including tooth cusp proportions between the western G. g. gorilla and the eastern G. g. beringei are considerable. Although more similar to G. g. beringei than to the western G. g. gorilla, G. g. graueri also shows distinct morphological features. This indicates that the morphology of G. g. graueri is not merely intermediate, and genetic isolation between the two eastern subspecies could have had a substantial influence. Such extensive variation in dental morphology in Gorilla gorilla can be considered to be the result of an interesting combination of factors, including local dietary adaptations.

Molecular phylogenetics of the hominoid Y chromosome,"['Samonte, RV', 'Conte, RA', 'Verma, RS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s100380050066,1998,2,"The Human Y-chromosome plays a central role in sex determination, and is composed of DNA sequences homologous to the Y-chromosome, families of Y-specific repetitive DNA sequences, and single copy sequences. We investigated the chromosomal location of Y-specific DNA sequences, in the chimpanzee (Prm troglodytes), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique. The Yq subtelomeric DNA sequences (DYS427) have been observed to be intact at the presumed loci. Also, the amelogenin gene (AMELY, Yp11.2) revealed sequence homology and positional conservation in the higher primates, except in gorilla where positional divergence was observed."
Concerted evolution of members of the multisequence family chAB4 located on various nonhomologous chromosomes,"['Assum, G', 'Pasantes, J', 'Glaser, B', 'Schempp, W', 'Wohr, G']",MAMMALIAN GENOME,10.1007/s003359900680,JAN 1998,5,"During the last years it became obvious that a lot of families of long-range repetitive DNA elements are located within the genomes of mammals. The principles underlying the evolution of such families, therefore, may have a greater impact than anticipated on the evolution of the mammalian genome as a whole. One of these families, called chAB4, is represented with about 50 copies within the human and the chimpanzee genomes and with only a few copies in the genomes of gorilla, orang-utan, and gibbon. Members of chAB4 are located on 10 different human chromosomes. FISH of chAB4-specific probes to chromosome preparations of the great apes showed that chAB4 is located, with only one exception, at orthologous places in the human and the chimpanzee genome. About half the copies in the human genome belong to two species-specific subfamilies that evolved after the divergence of the human and the chimpanzee lineages. The analysis of chAB4-specific PCR-products derived from DNA of rodent/human cell hybrids showed that members of the two human-specific subfamilies can be found on 9 of the 10 chAB4-carrying chromosomes. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the members of DNA sequence families can evolve as a unit despite their location at multiple sites on different chromosomes. The concerted evolution of the family members is a result of frequent exchanges of DNA sequences between copies located on different chromosomes. Interchromosomal exchanges apparently take place without greater alterations in chromosome structure."
A preliminary study of selective visual attention in female mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei),"['Watts, DP']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557744,JAN 1998,19,"Visually attending to conspecifics can give group-living primates important ecological information, help them to anticipate the behavior of others and to regulate interactions with them, and provide other valuable social information. Variation in the importance and quality of social relationships should influence the way individuals selectively attend to fellow group members. Preliminary data on visual monitoring of conspecifics by wild female mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) show that selective attention mirrors variation in social relationships. Social bonds between males and females are central to gorilla society; correspondingly, females are more likely to stop feeding and focus their attention on males who walk into view than on females, especially when males give displays. Females are more likely to focus on other females with whom they have antagonistic relationships than those (mostly close relatives) with whom they have affiliative, cooperative ones. Further research on the context and consequences of visual monitoring could help to address questions about the regulation of social relationships and about social cognition in gorillas."
Characterization of a macaque anti-Rh17-like monoclonal antibody,"['Blancher, A', 'Roubinet, F', 'Reid, ME', 'Socha, WW', 'Bailly, P', 'Benard, P']",VOX SANGUINIS,NA,1998,6,"In order to produce macaque monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human red blood cell (RBC) antigens, macaques were immunized with human and gorilla RBCs and their spleen lymphocytes were fused with man-mouse heteromyeloma cells. One macaque-mouse heterohybridoma produced a macaque IgGx, (Cyn2-4D5) which agglutinated all human RBCs but not rare human variants Dc-, D--, and Rh-null. Thus, Cyn2-4D5 exhibited RH17-like reactivity. The specificity of Cyn2-4D5 for RHCE-encoded polypeptides was confirmed by specific immunoprecipitation of RhcE and RhCe polypeptides from human RBCs and the absence of immunoprecipitation of the RhD polypeptides extracted from D-- RBCs. This study demonstrates that it is possible to produce macaque mAbs against human RBC blood group antigens."
