Gap size effects on photoinhibition in understorey saplings in tropical rainforest,"['Houter, NC', 'Pons, TL']",PLANT ECOLOGY,10.1007/s11258-004-5775-2,2005,23,"The sudden increase in irradiance after canopy disturbance in primary forest together with the accompanying increase in leaf temperatures is known to cause photoinhibition in shade acclimated foliage of understorey plants. We hypothesized that there is species specific variation among understorey saplings in the magnitude of photoinhibition in response to gap creation, which is related to their requirement for overstorey disturbance. Eleven more or less circular gaps were created varying in size from 60 up to 1459 m(2). Photoinhibition was assessed by determining predawn and midday F-v/F-m using chlorophyll fluorescence at two occasions during the first 3 weeks after creation of the gaps. The light environment was assessed using hemispherical photography. Five species that occurred in sufficient numbers in the understorey after gap creation were measured. They all showed an increase of photoinhibition with increasing gap size. Variation in exposure to direct sunlight within gaps contributed also to variation in photoinhibition. Dynamic photoinhibition, the overnight increase in F-v/F-m, was about 20% of total photoinhibition as measured at midday. The species responded quantitatively different. Oxandra asbeckii was most sensitive as evident from a decrease of predawn F-v/F-m from 0.79 in the understorey of undisturbed forest to 0.70 in the smallest and further to 0.41 in the largest gaps. Catostemma fragrans, the least sensitive species showed hardly any photoinhibition in the smallest gaps and less in the largest ones, whereas Lecythis concertiflora, Licania heteromorpha, and Chlorocardium rodiei had intermediate responses. Species rank order in sensitivity to photoinhibition was maintained across the whole range of gap sizes. The relationship between sensitivity to photoinhibition and species-specific gap size preference for regeneration is discussed."
"Long-term effect of timber harvesting in the Bartica Triangle, Central Guyana","['ter Steege, H', 'Welch, I', 'Zagt, R']",FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,10.1016/S0378-1127(01)00777-0,OCT 15 2002,20,"In one of the longest time series available, we present a comparison between forest inventories of 1924, 1964 and 1999 of an 800 km(2) forest-harvesting area in Central Guyana. Harvesting mainly targeted one species Chlorocardium rodiei (Greenheart), of which the population declined by 63% over the 75 years of harvesting. The decline of the population was not only detectable in the harvested size classes (>30 cm) but also among the smaller size classes. In 1999, however, Greenheart still ranked third in abundance. There was little change in the overall species composition, proportion of disperser groups or proportion of functional groups in the tree community. There were also no detectable changes in tree diversity. The conservation value of these unique forests can still be considered high. Thus, while the long-term sustainability of Greenheart harvesting is low, other ecological criteria of sustainability are met. Short-term recovery of Greenheart is not to be expected due to low population growth and small numbers of seed trees. Strategic choices will have to be made with regard to harvesting the remaining Greenheart stands-three scenarios are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
Wood identification in historic sites: Inferences for colonial trade and modification of vegetation on Barbuda,"['Watters, DR', 'Miller, RB']",CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE,NA,2000,1,"We report on four wood species identified from five samples taken from timbers in four historic buildings on Barbuda. Two samples were reported previously and three are new identifications. Fortuitous retention of splinter remnants from one of the older samples allowed us to verify the accuracy of its original identification. None of the species are native to Barbuda. Species of the white pine group (Pinus spp.) and the white oak group (Quercus spp.) grow in North America, greenheart (Chlorocardium rodiei) is native to Guyana and Suriname in South America, and bulletwood (Manilkara spp.) is native to the Neotropics, including the Antilles. These data corroborate empirically the importation of timber products into the colonial British West Indies, a trade that had been studied mainly by historians working from documents. Our analysis of the current body of knowledge about human-induced modification of Barbuda's native vegetation concludes that the vegetation has been modified more profoundly by the island's historic and modern inhabitants, whose occupation is brief compared to the preceding 3,500-year span of Amerindian occupation."
Spatial and temporal patterns of seed attack and germination in a large-seeded neotropical tree species,"['Hammond, DS', 'Brown, VK', 'Zagt, R']",OECOLOGIA,10.1007/s004420050778,MAY 1999,20,"It has long been argued that seed dispersal enhances recruitment in tropical trees by allowing offspring to 'escape' strong density/distance-dependent attack by insects, pathogens and rodents. Here we examined the effects of canopy openness and parent-offspring distance upon the frequency and timing of Chlorocardium rodiei seed attack and germination within a 15-ha plot of Guyanan tropical rain forest. Seeds were artificially dispersed beneath parent tries, in the understorey away from trees and in gaps. Analysing our data from an 85-week period of regular monitoring, we found that the main spatial gradients, canopy openness and distance to nearest adult conspecific, do not lead to differences in the final number of seeds attacked by infesting scolytid beetles or rodents, The timing of beetle attack, however, varied along the distance gradient and this difference affords seeds at further distances a 'window' in which to germinate and produce a seedling before attack. Canopy openness was not a good predictor of rooting success, but distance was strongly associated with root and shoot formation success and the mean time to shoot formation. There was a strong negative effect of distance on the likelihood of a seed being colonised by scolytid beetles prior to removal by rodents and shoot failure was strongly associated with prior infestation. We believe these results bring a key point to bear on the well-established notion of distance-dependent attack on seeds in tropical rainforests, viz. that seed characteristics (size, germination syndrome) and the timing of attack may be more important in explaining patterns of early seedling recruitment than distance. Our studies suggest that advantages accrued through dispersal in species like Chlorocardium will depend heavily on the 'race' between seed germination and attack. In the case of Chlorocardium, the 'race' can be lost at considerable distances due to its prolonged dormancy and the temporal fluctuations in fruitfall and rainfall which influence attack and germination. The results presented here suggest that the lag between seed attack and germination in tropical trees can regulate the influence of parent-offspring distance on cohort recruitment at this life history stage."
"The stenomatine moth, Stenoma catenifer Walsingham: a pre-dispersal seed predator of Greenheart (Chlorocardium rodiei (Schomb.) Rohwer, Richter & van der Werff) in Guyana","['Peredo, LC', 'Lyal, CHC', 'Brown, VK']",JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY,10.1080/002229399300236,APR 1999,9,"Stenoma catenifer Walsingham, a neotropical pest of avocado, is newly recorded from a wild host, the Guyanese endemic member of the Lauraceae, Chlorocardium rodiei (Schomb.) Rohwer, Richter & van der Werff, an economically very important timber source. This is a new record for both the host and for the country. The life cycle of S. catenifer on this host is described and compared with that previously documented for avocado. The different life stages are described and illustrated, and ecological and biological observations are given. Infestation levels were always less than 10%, in comparison with up to 80% found for avocado in Venezuela. The known hymenopteran parasitoids are discussed."
Regeneration through sprout formation in Chlorocardium rodiei (Lauraceae) in Guyana,"['Rijks, MH', 'Malta, EJ', 'Zagt, RJ']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,10.1017/S0266467498000340,JUL 1998,6,"The contribution of sprouts to the long-term survival of Chlorocardium rodiei, following logging was investigated. Differently aged sprout populations on cut stumps were surveyed to determine the numbers of sprouts produced, probability of survival and growth rates. Fifty-five to 70% of the stumps produced sprouts. The proportion of stumps that sprouted was lower for the hollow stumps than for the intact ones and the number of sprouts produced per stump was reduced. No significant correlation was found between stump diameter and the number of sprouts. Some sprouts survived for at least 15 y (usually one per stump), and these had a significantly larger average diameter relative to the sprouts at younger sites. The number of sprouts and the diameter of the largest sprout showed a significant positive correlation, suggesting that the maintenance of the inherited stump root system is shared among the sprouts so that the costs per sprout are reduced. We conclude that sprouting on cut stumps may have the potential to contribute to the maintenance of C. rodiei in the canopy at logged sites."
