Micro-evolutionary diversification among Indian Ocean parrots: temporal and spatial changes in phylogenetic diversity as a consequence of extinction and invasion,"['Jackson, H', 'Jones, CG', 'Agapow, PM', 'Tatayah, V', 'Groombridge, JJ', 'MAURITIUS PARAKEET']",IBIS,10.1111/ibi.12275,JUL 2015,0,"Almost 90% of global bird extinctions have occurred on islands. The loss of endemic species from island systems can dramatically alter evolutionary trajectories of insular species biodiversity, resulting in a loss of evolutionary diversity important for species adaptation to changing environments. The Western Indian Ocean islands have been the scene of evolution for a large number of endemic parrots. Since their discovery in the 16th century, many of these parrots have become extinct or have declined in numbers. Alongside the extinction of species, a number of the Indian Ocean islands have experienced colonization by highly invasive parrots, such as the Ring-necked Parakeet Psittacula krameri. Such extinctions and invasions can, on an evolutionary timescale, drive changes in species composition, genetic diversity and turnover in phylogenetic diversity, all of which can have important impacts on species potential for adaptation to changing environmental and climatic conditions. Using mtDNA cytochrome b data, we resolve the taxonomic placement of three extinct Indian Ocean parrots: the Rodrigues Psittacula exsul, Seychelles Psittacula wardi and Reunion Parakeets Psittacula eques. This case study quantifies how the extinction of these species has resulted in lost historical endemic phylogenetic diversity and reduced levels of species richness, and illustrates how it is being replaced by non-endemic invasive forms such as the Ring-necked Parakeet. Finally, we use our phylogenetic framework to identify and recommend a number of phylogenetically appropriate ecological replacements for the extinct parrots. Such replacements may be introduced once invasive forms have been cleared, to rejuvenate ecosystem function and restore lost phylogenetic diversity."
"Long-term, fine-scale temporal patterns of genetic diversity in the restored Mauritius parakeet reveal genetic impacts of management and associated demographic effects on reintroduction programmes","['Tollington, S', 'Jones, CG', 'Greenwood, A', 'Tatayah, V', 'Raisin, C', 'Burke, T', 'Dawson, DA', 'Groombridge, JJ']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2013.02.013,MAY 2013,5,"Threatened populations of birds are often restored after bottleneck events by using reintroduction techniques. Whilst population numbers are often increased by using such measures, the long-term genetic effects of reintroductions and post-release management of the resulting populations are frequently overlooked. We identify an overall declining trend in population-wide estimates of genetic diversity over two decades since the initial recovery of the population from the most severe part of this species' bottleneck. Additionally, by incorporating the genotypes of known founding individuals into population viability simulations, we evaluate the genetic effects of population management under various scenarios at both the metapopulation and subpopulation levels. We reveal that whilst population augmentation has led to increased genetic homogenisation among subpopulations, significant differentiation still exists. Simulations predict that even with a low level of natural dispersal leading to gene-flow this differentiation could be ameliorated. We conclude by offering a number of key recommendations relating to post-recovery management of reintroduced bird populations which support the encouragement of individual dispersal using established management techniques such as artificial nest-site provisioning.

Preliminary insights into the level of genetic variation retained in the endangered echo parakeet (Psittacula eques) towards assisting its conservation management,"['Taylor, TD', 'Parkin, DT']",AFRICAN ZOOLOGY,10.3377/004.045.0220,OCT 2010,2,"This study examined a suite of microsatellite markers, originally developed for other parrot species, for their usefulness in providing details about the amount of genetic variation that has been retained in the endangered echo parakeet of Mauritius. Biological samples were available from previous studies and management activities. Four microsatellite markers, originally developed for the African grey parrot, were characterized for use in the echo parakeet. Given its recent population bottleneck, a relatively high level of genetic diversity has been retained in the wild population (H(O) = 0.57). The genetic data are examined for their value in the conservation management of this species, both captive and wild. A number of conservation and breeding management issues are highlighted which warrant further investigation, for example in selecting captive breeding pairs and bachelor males for public display. Whilst four mircosatellite loci can only provide a limited insight, they do provide useful information relating to the remaining echo parakeet population and highlight that further genetic studies would prove invaluable to the conservation management of this species."
"Characterization of Mauritius parakeet (Psittacula eques) microsatellite loci and their cross-utility in other parrots (Psittacidae, Aves)","['Raisin, C', 'Dawson, DA', 'Greenwood, AG', 'Jones, CG', 'Groombridge, JJ']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02621.x,JUL 2009,3,"We characterized 21 polymorphic microsatellite loci in the endangered Mauritius parakeet (Psittacula eques). Loci were isolated from a Mauritius parakeet genomic library that had been enriched separately for eight different repeat motifs. Loci were characterized in up to 43 putatively unrelated Mauritius parakeets from a single population inhabiting the Black River Gorges National Park, Mauritius. Each locus displayed between three and nine alleles, with the observed heterozygosity ranging between 0.39 and 0.96. All loci were tested in 10 other parrot species. Despite testing few individuals, between seven and 21 loci were polymorphic in each of seven species tested."
"Preliminary evidence suggests extra-pair mating in the endangered echo parakeet, Psittacula eques
","['Taylor, TD', 'Parkin, DT']",AFRICAN ZOOLOGY,10.3377/004.044.0107,APR 2009,5,"Parrots are generally considered monogamous, forming strict pairs when breeding. Echo parakeets are unusual in that, although traditional breeding pairs occur, there are also multi-male breeding groups. This raises questions about the potential for extra-pair copulations. Genotype data were obtained from the dominant male and female in eight breeding groups (including three with profiles of attendant auxiliary males) and their 36 offspring. A further 34 offspring were available from eight breeding groups where profiles were available for a single parent. This study utilized four microsatellite genetic markers, originally developed for the African grey parrot. Parentage testing was undertaken using genotype comparisons with the dominant pair within the breeding group as well as auxiliary males where available. Although four markers were insufficient to Provide conclusive evidence they do suggest that extra-pair copulation occurs in this species. The echo parakeet is classified as endangered (<500 birds) and understanding its mating system would be valuable in its future conservation."
"Unbiased sex ratio among nestling echo parakeets Psittacula eques
","['Taylor, TD', 'Parkin, DI']",EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,NA,OCT 2008,4,"Question: Is the male-biased sex ratio observed in wild adult populations of the critically endangered echo parakeet potentially a consequence of inbreeding?

Study subjects: DNA samples were analysed from chicks over a 3-year period.

Method of analysis: Molecular screening enabled the primary sex ratio to be determined in a sample of sexually monomorphic nestlings.

Conclusion: No bias in sex ratio was observed in chicks, suggesting that the departure from equality observed among adults is due to differential mortality. Sex ratio bias can Occur due to a number of environmental and physiological factors. The implications to the current conservation management of this species in relation to sex ratio bias are discussed."
