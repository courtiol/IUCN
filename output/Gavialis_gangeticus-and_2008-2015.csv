Unanticipated effect of climate change on an aquatic top predator of the Atlantic rainforest,"['Herrera, J', 'Solari, A', 'Lucifora, LO']",AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,10.1002/aqc.2536,DEC 2015,0,"1. From a biodiversity conservation viewpoint it is crucial to estimate the sensitivity of species and populations to climate change, especially of key species such as top predators.

2. Here, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO) was used as a natural experiment to estimate the sensitivity of a population of the rainforest-dwelling broad-snouted caiman, Caiman latirostris, to extreme floods.

3. Caiman abundance declined by 35% annually between 1996 and 1998, and then increased, without reaching 1996 levels, indicating a marked effect of the 1997 El Nino. Accordingly, the Southern Oscillation Index was positively correlated with caiman abundance, indicating lower caiman abundance with warm ENSO events.

4. The relationship between the relative annual mean abundance of caimans and the maximum daily annual discharge of the Iguazu River was analysed. This relationship was parabolic, with caiman abundance increasing at discharges from 500 to 1500m(3) s(-1) and then decreasing at discharges from 1500 to 2500m(3) s(-1), indicating an adverse effect of both extreme low and high river discharge. No effect of illegal hunting was measurable.

5. This study evaluated whether the negative effect of extremely high water levels on caiman abundance could be due to a decrease in the availability of the habitat more commonly used by small (< 60 cm total length, TL) and medium (60-120 cm TL) caimans. Small and medium-sized caimans used herbaceous/shrub habitats more frequently than large caimans (>120 cm TL), i.e. the type of habitat flooded during extreme floods.

6. An increase in extreme floods, as forecast for the Atlantic rainforest owing to climate change, may seriously affect the population of rainforest caimans through the reduction of adequate habitat for juveniles. This counter-intuitive result, in which an excess of water reduces the abundance of an aquatic top predator, should be considered in conservation plans of rainforest-dwelling crocodilians.

"Vocalizations in two rare crocodilian species: A comparative analysis of distress calls of Tomistoma schlegelii (Muller, 1838) and Gavialis gangeticus (Gmelin, 1789)","['Bonke, R', 'Whitaker, N', 'Rodder, D', 'Bohme, W', 'AUDITORY RESPONSES']",NORTH-WESTERN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,NA,JUN 2015,0,"We analysed 159 distress calls of five individuals of T. schlegelii for temporal parameters and obtained spectral parameters in 137 of these calls. Analyses of G. gangeticus were based on 39 distress calls of three individuals, of which all could be analysed for temporal and spectral parameters. Our results document differences in the call structure of both species. Distress calls of T. schlegelii show numerous harmonics, whereas extensive pulse trains are present in G. gangeticus. In the latter, longer call durations and longer intervals between calls resulted in lower call repetition rates. Dominant frequencies of T. schlegelii are higher than in G. gangeticus. T. schlegelii specimens showed a negative correlation of increasing body size with decreasing dominant frequencies. Distress call durations increased with body size. schlegelii distress calls share only minor structural features with distress calls of G. gangeticus."

An Expanded Combined Evidence Approach to the Gavialis Problem Using Geometric Morphometric Data from Crocodylian Braincases and Eustachian Systems,"['Gold, MEL', 'Brochu, CA', 'Norell, MA']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0105793,SEP 8 2014,1,"The phylogenetic position of the Indian gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) is disputed - morphological characters place Gavialis as the sister to all other extant crocodylians, whereas molecular and combined analyses find Gavialis and the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) to be sister taxa. Geometric morphometric techniques have only begun to be applied to this issue, but most of these studies have focused on the exterior of the skull. The braincase has provided useful phylogenetic information for basal crurotarsans, but has not been explored for the crown group. The Eustachian system is thought to vary phylogenetically in Crocodylia, but has not been analytically tested. To determine if gross morphology of the crocodylian braincase proves informative to the relationships of Gavialis and Tomistoma, we used two-and three-dimensional geometric morphometric approaches. Internal braincase images were obtained using high-resolution computerized tomography scans. A principal components analysis identified that the first component axis was primarily associated with size and did not show groupings that divide the specimens by phylogenetic affinity. Sliding semi-landmarks and a relative warp analysis indicate that a unique Eustachian morphology separates Gavialis from other extant members of Crocodylia. Ontogenetic expansion of the braincase results in a more dorsoventrally elongate median Eustachian canal. Changes in the shape of the Eustachian system do provide phylogenetic distinctions between major crocodylian clades. Each morphometric dataset, consisting of continuous morphological characters, was added independently to a combined cladistic analysis of discrete morphological and molecular characters. The braincase data alone produced a clade that included crocodylids and Gavialis, whereas the Eustachian data resulted in Gavialis being considered a basally divergent lineage. When each morphometric dataset was used in a combined analysis with discrete morphological and molecular characters, it generated a tree that matched the topology of the molecular phylogeny of Crocodylia."
Novel microsatellite DNA markers for Indian Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus),"['Jogayya, KN', 'Meganathan, PR', 'Dubey, B', 'Haque, I']",CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES,10.1007/s12686-013-9908-6,SEP 2013,0,"The present status of existing crocodile species has increased the necessity to develop novel utilities for conservation. We have developed 18 microsatellite loci from the Indian Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) intended for genomic explanation and applied them to study genetic variation. Polymorphism of each locus was assessed in 32 individuals for G. gangeticus India. The number of alleles per locus varied from 2 to 8 (mean 5.5) for Indian population. Observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.73 to 1.00 and 0.50 to 0.81, respectively and the average polymorphic information content is 0.565. These selected markers are helpful for assessing population structure, intraspecific difference, and conservation and management of G. gangeticus."
Identification of Indian Crocodile Species Through DNA Barcodes,"['Meganathan, PR', 'Dubey, B', 'Jogayya, KN', 'Haque, I']",JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES,10.1111/1556-4029.12129,JUL 2013,0,"The biodiversity of India includes three crocodile species, Crocodylus palustris, Crocodylus porosus, and Gavialis gangeticus, whose status is threatened due to bushmeat crisis and illegal hunting. The crocodilian conservation management requires novel techniques to help forensic analysts to reveal species identity. DNA barcoding is a species identification technique, where a partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene is used as a marker for species identification. Herein, the DNA barcoding technique is evaluated for three Indian crocodiles by analyzing an approximately 750-bp barcode region. The alignment result shows interspecific variations between sequences for discrimination of the three Indian crocodiles leading to species identification. The phylogenetic analyses also substantiate the established crocodilian relationships, which add further advantage to use this DNA barcoding approach for Indian crocodiles. This study provides preliminary evidences for the use of DNA barcoding technique in the identification of Indian crocodile species."
Feeding Mechanics in Spinosaurid Theropods and Extant Crocodilians,"['Cuff, AR', 'Rayfield, EJ']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0065295,MAY 28 2013,7,"A number of extant and extinct archosaurs evolved an elongate, narrow rostrum. This longirostrine condition has been associated with a diet comprising a higher proportion of fish and smaller prey items compared to taxa with broader, more robust snouts. The evolution of longirostrine morphology and a bulbous anterior rosette of premaxillary teeth also occurs in the spinosaurid theropod dinosaurs, leading to suggestions that at least some members of this clade also had a diet comprising a notable proportion of fish or other small vertebrates. Here we compare the rostral biomechanics of the spinosaurs Baryonyx walkeri and Spinosaurus c.f. S. aegyptiacus to three extant crocodilians: two longistrine taxa, the African slender-snouted crocodile Mecistops cataphractus and the Indian gharial Gavialis gangeticus; and the American alligator Alligator mississippiensis. Using computed tomography (CT) data, the second moments of area and moments of inertia at successive transverse slices along the rostrum were calculated for each of the species. Size-independent results tested the biomechanical benefits of material distribution within the rostra. The two spinosaur rostra were both digitally reconstructed from CT data and compared against all three crocodilians. Results show that African slender-snouted crocodile skulls are more resistant to bending than an equivalent sized gharial. The alligator has the highest resistances to bending and torsion of the crocodiles for its size and greater than that of the spinosaurs. The spinosaur rostra possess similar resistance to bending and torsion despite their different morphologies. When size is accounted for, B. walkeri performs mechanically differently from the gharial, contradicting previous studies whereas Spinosaurus does not. Biomechanical data support known feeding ecology for both African slender-snouted crocodile and alligator, and suggest that the spinosaurs were not obligate piscivores with diet being determined by individual animal size."
Rigorous gharial population estimation in the Chambal: implications for conservation and management of a globally threatened crocodilian,"['Nair, T', 'Thorbjarnarson, JB', 'Aust, P', 'Krishnaswamy, J']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02189.x,OCT 2012,3,"India's Chambal River hosts the largest population of the critically endangered gharial. Boat-based daylight surveys to date only provide indices of relative abundance, without measures of survey bias or error. No attempt to quantify detection probabilities in these surveys has yet been made, and thus, absolute density estimates of this population remain unknown. We surveyed 75 km of the River Chambal and photographed individual gharials for capturerecapture analysis. The total sampling effort yielded 400 captures. Population closure was supported (z = -1.48, P = 0.069), and closed-population models were used to estimate abundances. Models were selected using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) index of model fit. The best model estimated 231 +/- 32 adult, 83 +/- 23 subadult and 89 +/- 19 juvenile gharials (Mean +/- SE), respectively, while the model-averaged estimate was 220 +/- 28 adult, 76 +/- 16 subadults and 93 +/- 16 juvenile gharials, respectively. The best model estimated absolute densities of 3.08 +/- 0.43, 1.11 +/- 0.3 and 1.19 +/- 0.25 adult, subadult and juvenile gharials km-1, respectively, while the model-averaged estimate was 2.93 +/- 0.37, 1.01 +/- 0.21 and 1.24 +/- 0.21 adult, subadult and juvenile gharials km-1, respectively, compared with relative densities of 0.94, 0.45 and 0.30 adult, subadult and juvenile gharials km-1, respectively, from boat-based daylight surveys. On the basis of our best model, we suggest a detection probability based correction factor of 3.27, 2.47 and 3.97 to boat-based daylight survey estimates of adult, subadult and juvenile gharials, respectively. Synthesis and applications. Used within the framework of capturerecapture analysis, photoidentification provides a reliable and noninvasive method of estimating population size and structure in crocodilians. We also opine that without determining the current status of gharials, highly intensive strategies, such as the egg-collection and rear-and-release programmes being implemented currently, initiated on the basis of underestimates of population sizes, are unwarranted and divert valuable conservation resources away from field-based protection measures, which are essential in the face of threats like hydrologic diversions, sand mining, fishing and bankside cultivation."

Gavialis from the Pleistocene of Thailand and Its Relevance for Drainage Connections from India to Java","['Martin, JE', 'Buffetaut, E', 'Naksri, W', 'Lauprasert, K', 'Claude, J', 'MAMMALIAN FAUNAS']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0044541,SEP 18 2012,2,"Background: The genus Gavialis comprises a single living but endangered species, G. gangeticus, as well as fossil species recorded in the Miocene to Pleistocene deposits of the Indian subcontinent. The genus is also represented in the Pleistocene deposits of Java by the species G. bengawanicus, which was recently recognized to be valid. Surprisingly, no detailed report of the genus exists between these two provinces and the recent evolutionary history of Gavialis is not understood.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We report new material consisting of skull and mandibular remains of Gavialis from the Early Pleistocene of Khok Sung, Nakhon Ratchasima Province, northeastern Thailand. The Gavialis material described herein is attributed to Gavialis cf. bengawanicus and sheds new light on the occurrence of the genus in mainland SE Asia.

Conclusions/Significance: Comparison of this new material with other species referred to the genus Gavialis led us to preliminary restrict the content of the genus to three species, namely G. gangeticus Gmelin, G. bengawanicus Dubois and G. lewisi Lull. The occurrence of G. cf. bengawanicus in Thailand allows us to propose a scenario for the dispersal of Gavialis from Indo-Pakistan to Indonesia, thus bridging a geographical gap between these two provinces. Dispersal by sea appears a less likely possibility than dispersal through fluvial drainages."

"Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) populations and human influences on habitat on the River Chambal, India","['Katdare, S', 'Srivathsa, A', 'Joshi, A', 'Panke, P', 'Pande, R', 'Khandal, D', 'Everard, M']",AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,10.1002/aqc.1195,JUN 2011,1,"1. The gharial, Gavialis gangeticus (Gmelin 1789), a piscivorous reptile of Asian river systems, is increasingly threatened by diverse human pressures.

2. Three survey expeditions were launched to monitor gharial populations, notable wildlife, and the activities and attitudes of local people in a 110km stretch of the Chambal River in the National Chambal Reserve (NCS), India.

3. Only 15% of gharial observed in December 2009 were in the upstream 54% of the surveyed river length. This coincides with the highest density of disturbance including water pumps, fishermen, and the highest growth in fishing activity since December 2008.

4. Although fishing is recognized as a significant threat to gharial, no strong relationship was found between numbers of gharial and fishermen. However, numbers of water pumps, indicative of the intensity of agricultural activity, had a negative relationship with gharial numbers. This relationship was strengthened by omitting the upstream (Pali to Rameshwaram) survey reach, the tourist area of the NCS, which is also potentially affected by upstream reaches.

5. The downstream 46% of surveyed river length in December 2009 supported 85% of gharial (consistent with trends in other surveys), including 91.6% of males and 81.8% of juveniles. This reach is classified as a High Population Recorded Area of high potential conservation importance, also containing better habitat quality and lower human disturbance.

6. A positive relationship was found between gharial numbers and sand habitat features. However, the Davar to Ghoonsai survey reach had low gharial numbers despite abundant sand features, perhaps due to a substantial length of the Ghoonsai sand bank having been converted or agriculture. This may have significant implications for gharial conservation. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Despite conservation programmes (India 1975, Nepal 1978) gharial populations (Gavialis gangeticus) have declined over their entire distribution range. Information about the current status and main threats is needed to implement effective conservation measures.

2. This study presents a survey (2003/2004) of the largest Nepalese gharial population in the Chitwan National Park that has benefited from regular re-introduction of young gharials since 1981.

3. Population size estimates fluctuate between 34 (2003) and 38 (2004). The reintroduction programme, although of limited success, has helped to maintain the gharial population.

4. Gharials bask preferentially in large sand banks, and these sites must be protected.

5. The main threats are from a dam that causes fish depletion and flushes gharials from the protected area, sand mining and grazing that destroy basking sites, fishing that causes food shortage, drift nets that kill gharial, and water pollution.

6. Improvement in the survival of reintroduced gharials is needed. Strict protection of preferred basking sites and prohibition of fishing in the main settling zones are the principal conservation measures while in the long term, education and participatory management by local people are also necessary.

Two complete mitochondrial genomes of Crocodylus and implications for crocodilians phylogeny,"['Feng, G', 'Wu, XB', 'Yan, P', 'Li, XQ']",AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA,NA,2010,6,"The complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes of two crocodilians: Crocodylus palustris and Crocodylus mindorensis, were sequenced in order to examine their gene and genome features. Additionally, we intended to increase the amount of molecular data suitable for phylogenetic analysis. Their gene orders conform to other crocodilians that have been sequenced, except the arrangement of two tRNA genes differ from other vertebrates, showing that the gene order of crocodilians is remarkably conserved. Phylogenetic analyses (maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference) based on the mt protein-coding genes at the nucleotide level were performed among crocodilians for which complete mt genomes were available. The results suggest that the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) joins the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) on a common branch, that constitutes a sister group to traditional Crocodylidae. In this report, Mecistops cataphractus is evidently most closely related to Osteolaemus tetraspis. They are isolated as sister taxon from the main clades in Crocodylus. Regarding Paleosuchus, it appears as sister group to Caiman within the Alligatoridae. In particular, relationships among species of Crocodylus (true crocodiles) are discussed."

To explore its utility as a phylogenetic marker, the complete intron one region (789-805 bp) was sequenced in 22 crocodylian species. Detailed analyses of intron I resolved the three expected lineages, Alligatorids, Crocodylids, and Gavialids, and offered additional evidence for the utility of synapomorphic indels in elucidating higher-level phylogenetic relationships.

Molecular Identification of Indian Crocodile Species: PCR-RFLP Method for Forensic Authentication,"['Meganathan, PR', 'Dubey, B', 'Haque, I']",JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES,10.1111/j.1556-4029.2009.01119.x,SEP 2009,11,"South East Asian countries are known for illegal poaching and trade of crocodiles clandestinely, to be used in skin, medicinal, and cosmetic industries. Besides crocodiles being listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, India has its Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 for conservation of crocodile species. Hitherto, lack of any rapid and reliable technique for examinations of crocodile-based crime exhibits such as skin, bones, etc. has been a major problem for an effective promulgation of law on illegal trade. DNA-based identification of species using PCR-RFLP technique for an apt identification of all the three Indian crocodile species namely, Crocodylus porosus, Crocodylus palustris and Gavialis gangeticus is presented here. A 628 bp segment of cytochrome b gene was amplified using novel primers followed by restriction digestion with three enzymes i.e., HaeIII, MboI, and MwoI, separately and in combination. The technique has produced a species-specific pattern for identifying the three crocodile species individually, which fulfills the requirement for its forensic application. It is expected that the technique will prove handy in identification of all the three Indian crocodile species and strengthen conservation efforts."

The lack of molecular techniques for the identification of confiscated samples makes it difficult to enforce the law. Conclusive forensic identification of species requires a complete gene sequence which is difficult in case of degraded samples. We have developed two novel sets of primers to amplify two partial cytochrome b gene sequences of six crocodile species i.e. Crocodylus palustris, Crocodylus porosus, Crocodylus siamensis, Crocodylus niloticus, Gavialis gangeticus and Caiman crocodilus. These partial sequences were edited to give a complete cyt b gene sequence, which can be used as an effective tool for forensic authentication of crocodile species.

Such decline could be restrained by acknowledging the scope of target species, so that all relevant stages in their life cycle are considered.

2. The gharial Gavialis gangeticus is a prominent riverine species of the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra and Mahanadi river systems that is becoming increasingly rare due to reduction in water flow and available nesting beaches, modification of river morphology and increased mortality in fishing nets. Despite these threats, scientific information on habitat selection by gharial is still inadequate, which hinders conservation measures.

3. This paper presents the population status, basking site selection and water depth preferences of different size-classes of gharial based on a study conducted in the National Chambal Sanctuary, India.

4. Between 1992 and 2007 a 40% decline in the gharial population was observed in the National Chambal Sanctuary. The decline was prominent in the recruitment class (< 120 cm), which primarily comes from the nests laid in the wild, and also in sub-adults (> 180 to 270 cm) comprising both wild and reintroduced gharial.

5. Along the Chambal River, gharial preferred sandy parts of the river banks and sand bars for basking and showed less preference for rocky river banks and rocky Outcrops. Clay river banks were least preferred.

6. Juvenile gharials < 120 cm and 120-180 cm preferred water depths 1-3 m and 2-3 m, respectively. Gharial > 180 cm (including sub-adults and adults) preferred water depths > 4 m.

7. Increasing demands for sand for development activities, and water abstraction for irrigation and energy generation coupled with mortality in fishing nets, are likely to affect gharial and other aquatic species, and steps need to be taken to maintain the minimum river flow necessary to sustain ecosystem processes.

Cranial shape and correlated characters in crocodilian evolution,"['Sadleir, RW', 'Makovicky, PJ']",JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01602.x,NOV 2008,19,"Crocodilians show a high degree of cranial variation and convergence throughout their 80 million-year fossil record that complicates their phylogenetic reconstruction. Conflicting phylogenetic results from different data partitions and character homoplasies typify crocodilian phylogeny, and differences between molecular and morphological phylogenetic hypotheses are believed to be associated with the slender-snout skull shape of Gavialis gangeticus and Tomistoma schlegelii. Slender-snout skulls are one of five identified eusuchian cranial ecomorph shape categories (ESCs) thought to reflect functional or ecological specialization. This paper tested the effect of transitions among general, blunt and slender ESCs on cranial character-state distributions in phylogeny using the concentrated changes test. In addition, 'tree-free' character compatibility analysis of character independence was conducted on the morphological character matrix to determine if character correlations are observed independent of specific tree topologies. Results suggest cranial ESCs do affect cranial character-state gains in phylogeny. Concentrated changes identify a broad suite of character-state changes that significantly correlate with transitions to slender, general and blunt ESCs on morphological, molecular and combined-data tree topologies, but numbers of correlated characters for each category differ according to topology. Character compatibility analysis results do not mirror the concentrated changes test results and reflect hierarchically distributed support throughout the data. As cranial ESCs affect character-state transitions, it is possible that nonphylogenetic variables could affect inferences of crocodilian phylogeny by affecting cranial morphology."
"Proctocaecum gairhei n. sp (Digenea : Cryptogonimidae : Acanthostominae) from Gavialis gangeticus (Gmelin) in Nepal and a revised cladogram of Proctocaecum Baugh, 1957","['Junker, K', 'Brooks, DR', 'Boomker, J']",SYSTEMATIC PARASITOLOGY,10.1007/s11230-008-9151-9,NOV 2008,2,"Proctocaecum gairhei n. sp. is described from the gharial Gavialis gangeticus (Gmelin) in Nepal. The new taxon can be distinguished from all other species of Proctocaecum Baugh, 1957 by the combination of the following morphological characters: a single row of 23 cephalic spines, lateral anal pores opening at uneven levels, a forebody accounting for 16% of the total body length (TBL), an oral to ventral sucker width ratio of 1:0.7, an oral sucker to pharynx width ratio of 1:0.6 and uterine loops that occupy 59-67% of the TBL. While sharing some morphological characteristics with Acanthostomum slusarskii Kalyankar, 1977 from Crocodylus palustris (Lesson) in India, P. gairhei n. sp. is distinguished from the latter by possessing the solid muscular gonotyl diagnostic for Proctocaecum, by the number of cephalic spines, position of the anal pores and egg size. The existing cladogram for Proctocaecum was expanded using the character information of P. gairhei n. sp. The host range of Proctocaecum is now known to include all three families of the order Crocodylia."
