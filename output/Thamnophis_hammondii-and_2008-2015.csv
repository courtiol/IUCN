"Observations on the diet of the two-stripped garter snake Thamnophis hammondii in an oasis of Baja California Sur, Mexico","['Luja, VH', 'Rodriguez-Estrella, R', 'Sinervo, B']",REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD,10.7550/rmb.32185,JUN 2013,0,"Information is presented about the prey consumed by the two-stripped garter snake Thamnophis hammondii in a mountain oasis in Baja California Sur, Mexico. The diet of this threatened snake includes the Baja California treefrog Pseudacris hypochondriaca curta (native species), as well as an exotic fish: the red bellied tilapia Tilapia sp. cf. zilli. This exotic species has become invasive in Baja California Sur oases, displacing native fishes and becoming an important dietary resource to T. hammondii."
Speed and endurance of Thamnophis hammondii are not affected by consuming the toxic frog Xenopus laevis,"['Foster, CD', 'Mullin, SJ']",SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST,10.1894/WL-19.1,SEP 2008,0,"Toxins of Xenopus laevis elicit gaping responses in some snakes, but introduced populations of this species in California provide an additional food source for Thamnophis hammondii with no observable ill effects to the snake. This study addresses the locomotor performance of T hammondii after consuming this toxic frog. Endurance and speed of T. hammondii were measured along a 2-m long racetrack when subjects were not fed recently, when they were fed sunfish (Lepomis, a nontoxic prey), and when they were fed X. laevis. Snakes tended to be slower after eating, but ingestion of X. laevis did not affect either measure of locomotor performance in T. hammondii. Because performance of T. hammondii is not compromised, selective pressure against consumption of X. laevis probably is absent."
"Variation in pupil diameter in North American Gartersnakes (Thamnophis) is regulated by immersion in water, not by light intensity","['Fontenot, CL']",VISION RESEARCH,10.1016/j.visres.2008.01.006,JUL 2008,2,"A variable pupil generally regulates the amount of incoming light available for image formation on the retina. However, some of the semi-aquatic snakes (North American Gartersnakes, Thamnophis) that forage in relatively low light conditions reduce the pupil aperture in response to submergence underwater at the expense incoming light. Given that these snakes have all-cone retinas, reduction of incoming light because of pupillary constriction upon immersion seems counterintuitive. To test the effect of light and water on pupil aperture, three species of North American Gartersnakes (T atratus, T. hammondii, and T sirtalis) were exposed to nine light intensities in air and water. There was no effect of light on relative pupil aperture for any species. However, all three species showed a significant reduction in pupil aperture upon submergence underwater. The lack of a light response is surprising, and may be related to the method of accommodation in snakes. Snakes lack a ciliary muscle, and move the lens by constricting the pupil, which increases pressure in the posterior chamber and pushes the lens for-ward. Upon submergence, the snakes may be attempting to overcome the change in refractive index and defocus imposed by the water, by constricting the pupil. Thus, having the iris muscle involved in accommodation may preclude it from much of a light regulating function. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
