"Induction, development and maturation of somatic embryos in Bunge's pine (Pinus bungeana Zucc. ex Endl.)","['Zhang, CX', 'Li, Q', 'Kong, LS', 'SPRUCE PICEA-GLAUCA']",PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE,10.1007/s11240-007-9294-4,DEC 2007,12,"Embryogenic tissue was induced from developing immature zygotic embryos in Bunge's pine (Pinus bungeana Zucc. ex Endl.). Induction rate reached 84.4% with our best treatment. Zygotic embryos were dissected from megagametophytes and inoculated on different induction media, DCR1 (Gupta PK, Durzan DJ (1985) Plant Cell Rep 4:177-179), BM1 (Gupta PK, Pullman G (1991) U.S. Patent No. 5,036,00) and MSG (Becwar MR, et al. (1988) Somatic cell genetic of woody plants. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, pp. 1-18), supplemented with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BA). DCR1 was the best medium for initiating embryogenic tissue. Induction rates were affected significantly by developmental stages of explants. The highest induction rate was obtained with embryos collected on either June 20 or June 30 with 10 mg 1(-1) 2, 4-D and 4 mg 1(-1) BA. Embryogenic tissue was subcultured monthly on DCR1 medium supplemented with 0.3 mg 1(-1) 2, 4-D and 0.2 mg 1(-1) a-naphthaleneacetic acid. In order to enhance embryo maturation, embryogenic tissue was transferred onto DCR1 medium for two weeks, in which 1,000 mg 1(-1) myo-inositol was included and all plant growth regulators were eliminated. This pretreated tissue was then transferred onto a maturation medium that was DCR1 medium containing 50 g 1(-1) sucrose and 0.1 mg 1(-1) indolebutyric acid. In this study, benefits of embryo maturation were not observed when abscisic acid and polyethylene glycol were applied in the culture."
[Physico-chemical characteristics of ambient particles settling upon leaf surface of six conifers in Beijing].,"['Wang, Lei', 'Hasi, Eerdun', 'Liu, Lian-You', 'Gao, Shang-Yu']","Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology / Zhongguo sheng tai xue xue hui, Zhongguo ke xue yuan Shenyang ying yong sheng tai yan jiu suo zhu ban",NA,2007-Mar,0,"The study on the density of ambient particles settling upon the leaf surface of six conifers in Beijing, the micro-configurations of the leaf surface, and the mineral and element compositions of the particles showed that at the same sites and for the same tree species, the density of the particles settling upon leaf surface increased with increasing ambient pollution, but for various tree species, it differed significantly, with the sequence of Sabina chinensis and Platycladus orientalis > Cedrus deodara and Pinus bungeana > P. tabulaeformis and Picea koraiensis. Due to the effects of road dust, low height leaf had a larger density of particles. The density of the particles was smaller in summer than in winter because of the rainfall and new leaf growth. The larger the roughness of leaf surface, the larger density of the particles was. In the particles, the overall content of SiO2, CaCO3, CaMg(CO3,), NaCl, 2CaSO4 . H2O, CaSO4 . 2H2O and Fe2O3 was about 10%-30%, and the main minerals were montmorillonite, illite, kaolinite and feldspar. The total content of 21 test elements in the particles reached 16%-37%, among which, Ca, Al, Fe, Mg, K, Na and S occupied 97% or more, while the others were very few and less affected by sampling sites and tree species."
"A rapid, efficient method for the mass production of pollen protoplasts from Pinus bungeana Zucc. ex Endl. and Picea wilsonii Mast.","['Fang, KF', 'Zhang, LY', 'Lin, JX']",FLORA,10.1016/j.flora.2005.04.005,2006,1,"An optimized protocol was established to isolate large numbers of mature living pollen protoplasts of Pinus bungeana Zucc. ex Endl. and Picea wilsonii Mast. Intact pollen grains of P. bungeana or pollen with short tubes were incubated with gentle agitation in a solution of 2% cellulase R-10, 1.5% macerozyme R-10, 15% sucrose, 0.01% H3BO3, and 0.01% CaCl2. Intact pollen protoplasts with diameters of 40 mu m were liberated, with an isolation rate of up to 70% after 6 h of enzymatic incubation. The optimal pH and temperature for the reaction were 5.8 and 24 degrees C, respectively, and the optimal enzymatic digestion conditions were 6 h of incubation in the above solution. The method for isolating pollen protoplasts from P. wilsonii was similar to that for P. bungeana, except that the incubation medium contained 12% rather than 15% sucrose and the optimal enzyme concentrations were 3% cellulase and 2% macerozyme. The isolated pollen protoplasts were demonstrated to be living by microscopy in a fluorochromatic reaction with fluorescein diacetate (FDA). (C) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."
WOOD FRACTURE PATTERN DURING THE WATER DESORPTION PROCESS,"['Wang, Liyu', 'Zhao, Guangjie', 'Lu, Zhenyou']",Maderas. Ciencia y tecnología,10.4067/S0718-221X2006000100003,2006,0,"Wood is a hygroscopic material and its mechanical properties change with moisture content below the fiber saturation point. Fracture characteristic is one of most important mechanical properties of wood and often is taken as an important safety design factor for wood as an engineered structural material. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of moisture content changes on wood fracture properties, focusing on fracture behavior and patterns with different crack orientations of Betula platyphylla Suk. and Pinus bungeana in two different desorption processes. These two desorption processes were, respectively, from fiber saturation point to an equilibrium moisture content corresponding to 82.4 %RH at 20°C and from 82.4 %RH to 35.2 %RH at the same temperature of 20 °C"
Heterotrimeric G protein alpha-subunit is localized in the plasma membrane of Pinus bungeana pollen tubes,"['Zhang, LY', 'Fang, KF', 'Lin, JX']",PLANT SCIENCE,10.1016/j.plantsci.2005.07.015,DEC 2005,2,"Heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in a variety of cellular responses, but relatively little is known about their function and biochemistry in plant pollen. In this paper, we establish the presence of a G protein associated with the plasma membranes of Pinus bungeana pollen tube. A 40 kDa polypeptide is detected and immunolocalized predominantly in pollen tube plasma membranes by polyclonal antisera directed against conserved peptides of mammalian G alpha-subunit during pollen tube development. Cholera and pertussis toxins exhibited biphasic actions on tube growth, that is to say, inhibited pollen tube growth and result in rupture of tubes at concentrations less than 400 ng mL(-1), whereas stimulated pollen tube growth at concentration over 500 ng mL(-1). Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra showed that the two toxins at concentrations of 400 ng mL(-1) resulted in enhanced synthesis of phenolics and reduced synthesis of cellulose, hemicellulose, and xylan of pollen tube wall, which may account for incidental rupture of pollen tubes at the concentration. These results suggest that the two toxins possibly affect pollen tube growth via downstream pertussis or cholera toxin-sensitive functional proteins, which regulate tube wall biosynthesis than at the G alpha-subunit in P. bungeana tube growth.

"Casparian strips in needles are more solute permeable than endodermal transport barriers in roots of Pinus bungeana
","['Wu, XQ', 'Lin, JX', 'Lin, QQ', 'Wang, J', 'Schreiber, L']",PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/pcp/pci194,NOV 2005,10,"The structure and development of endodermal Casparian strips in Pinus bungeana needles and roots were studied by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Primary pit fields (PFs) frequently occurred in radial walls of Casparian strips isolated from needles, whereas PFs were never detected in Casparian strips from roots. Formation of Casparian strips in needles as well as roots started at the outer parts of the radial walls and they finally occupied the entire radial walls of the endodermis. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of Casparian strips isolated from roots revealed significant absorption bands characteristic for suberin. However, in Casparian strips of needles, evidence for suberin was rarely detected by FTIR spectroscopy. The apoplastic permeability of Casparian strips in needles and roots was probed by the apoplastic tracers calcofluor and berberine. Casparian strips in roots efficiently blocked the apoplastic transport (AT) of calcofluor and berberine. Casparian strips in needles blocked the AT of calcofluor, but diffusion of berberine was not inhibited and berberine thiocyanate crystals were detectable in the vascular tissue of the needles. From the data presented, it must be concluded that Casparian strips in needles, which are characterized by the absence of suberin, are more solute permeable compared with Casparian strips in roots."
Inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis in pollen tube development of Pinus bungeana by actinomycin D and cycloheximide,"['Hao, HQ', 'Li, YQ', 'Hu, YX', 'Lin, JX']",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01290.x,MAR 2005,19,"The effects of actinomycin D and cycloheximide on RNA and protein synthesis were investigated during pollen tube development of Pinus bungeana.

RNA and protein contents, protein expression patterns, cell wall components and ultrastructural changes of pollen tubes were studied using spectrophotometry, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Pollen grains germinated in the presence of actinomycin D, but tube elongation and RNA synthesis were inhibited. By contrast, cycloheximide inhibited pollen germination and protein synthesis, induced abnormal tube morphology, and retarded the tube growth rate. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that protein expression patterns changed distinctly, with some proteins being specific for each phase. FTIR microspectroscopy established significant changes in the chemical composition of pollen tube walls. TEM analysis revealed the inhibitors caused disintegration of organelles involved in the secretory system.

These results suggested RNA necessary for pollen germination and early tube growth were present already in the pollen grains before germination, while the initiation of germination and the maintenance of pollen tube elongation depended on continuous protein synthesis."
[Dust absorption effect of urban conifers in northeast China].,"['Chen, Wei', 'He, Xingyuan', 'Zhang, Yue', 'Sun, Yu', 'Wang, Wenfei', 'Ning, Zhuhua']","Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology / Zhongguo sheng tai xue xue hui, Zhongguo ke xue yuan Shenyang ying yong sheng tai yan jiu suo zhu ban",NA,2003-Dec,0,"Dust pollution is much heavier in winter than in other seasons in the cities of Northeast China, because the urban heating system consumes mainly coal as energy resources. Deciduous trees can hardly absorb dust because of their defoliation, and hence, urban conifer trees become more important in dust absorption in winter. This paper studied the dust absorption ability of 7 conifers under the same and different dust pollution status in Shenyang city, Northeast China. The results showed that the dust absorption ability of conifers was decreased in the order of Abies holophilla > Picea mongolica > P. koraiensis > Taxus cupidata > Pinus bungeana > P. armandi > P. tabulaeformis. Different conifers had different surface structures. Pinus bungeana, P. armandi and P. tabulaeformis had smooth surfaces, their cells and stomata arranged in order, and hence, their dust absorption ability was poor. P. koraiensis, Abies holophilla and Taxus cupidata had coarse surfaces, and their cells and stomata arranged out of order. There were even many tubercular things on the surface of P. koraiensis, and hence, their dust absorption ability was stronger. The dust absorption ability of conifers was related the shape of their leaf sections. The upper leaf surface of Pinus bungeana and P. tabulaeformis was arc, not opted to absorb the dust. The leaf section of P. armandi was prism, and its upper surface was narrow, and hence, its dust absorption ability was also poor. The leaves of Picea mongolica and P. koraiensis had four edges, their upper surfaces were broader and flatter than the former three species, and hence, they had stronger dust absorption ability. The leaf section's shape of Abies holophilla and Taxus cupidata was also broad and flat, which made the dust absorption ability of the two latter's was stronger than other three Pinus species and two Picea species."
Casparian strips in needles of Pinus bungeana: isolation and chemical characterization,"['Wu, XQ', 'Lin, JX', 'Zhu, JM', 'Hu, YX', 'Hartmann, K', 'Schreiber, L']",PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM,10.1034/j.1399-3054.2003.00031.x,MAR 2003,16,"By using cell wall degrading enzymes, Casparian strips were for the first time isolated from Pinus bungeana needle endodermis. They appeared as a fine network, similar to those isolated from roots. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis provided evidence that the Casparian strips were impregnated with lignin, suberin, cellulose and cell wall proteins."
Wood fracture pattern during the water adsorption process,"['Wang, LY', 'Lu, ZY', 'Zhao, GJ']",HOLZFORSCHUNG,NA,2003,7,"A research program was conducted to investigate the effect of water transition on wood fracture properties, focusing on fracture behavior and patterns with different crack orientations of Betula platyphylla Suk. and Pinus bungeana in three different moisture adsorption processes. At a constant temperature of 20degreesC, three levels of relative humidity were considered: 66%, 82% and 100%. The results indicated that moisture content did not influence the crack propagation path, while specimen crack orientation did.With longer moisture adsorption times, the time needed to reach the maximum load from the critical load also grew; this is because below the fiber saturation point, from excessive dryness to a certain moisture content, the cell wall becomes less brittle and the toughness is enhanced. At 20degreesC constant temperature, the fracture toughness gradually increased from ovendry state adsorbing moisture to 82% relative humidity, but decreased from 82% to 100% relative humidity.Within a tree species, fracture toughness depended on specimen type.The fracture toughness of LT specimens was by far higher than that of TL and TR specimens. The LT specimen fracture toughness of Betula platyphylla Suk. was comparable to that of Pinus bungeana."
[Characterization of 5S rRNA gene sequence and secondary structure in gymnosperms].,"['Liu, Zhan-Lin', 'Zhang, Da-Ming', 'Wang, Xiao-Ru']",Yi chuan xue bao = Acta genetica Sinica,NA,2003-Jan,0,"In higher plants the primary and the secondary structures of 5S ribosomal RNA gene are considered highly conservative. Little is known about the 5S rRNA gene structure, organization and variation in gyimnosperms. In this study we analyzed sequence and structure variation of 5S rRNA gene in Pinus through cloning and sequencing multiple copies of 5S rDNA repeats from individual trees of five pines, P. bungeana, P. tabulaeformis, P. yunnanensis, P. massoniana and P. densata. Pinus bungeana is from the subgenus Strobus while the other four are from the subgenus Pinus (diploxylon pines). Our results revealed variations in both primary and secondary structure among copies of 5S rDNA within individual genomes and between species. 5S rRNA gene in Pinus is 120 bp long in most of the 122 clones we sequenced except for one or two deletions in three clones. Among these clones 50 unique sequences were identified and they were shared by different pine species. Our sequences were compared to 13 sequences each representing a different gymnosperm species, and to six sequences representing both angiosperm monocots and dicots. Average sequence similarity was 97.1% among Pinus species and 94.3% between Pinus and other gymnosperms. Between gymnosperms and angiosperms the sequence similarity decreased to 88.1%. Similar to other molecular data, significant sequence divergence was found between the two Pinus subgenera. The 5S gene tree (neighbor-joining tree) grouped the four diploxylon pines together and separated them distinctly from P. bungeana. Comparison of sequence divergence within individuals and between species suggested that concerted evolution has been very weak especially after the divergence of the four diploxylon pines. The phylogenetic information contained in the 5S rRNA gene is limited due to its shorter length and the difficulties in identifying orthologous and paralogous copies of rDNA multigene family further complicate its phylogenetic application. Pinus densata is a diploid hybrid between P. tabulaeformis and P. yunnanensis. Its 5S rDNA composition is consistent with its hybrid origin. 5S rRNA of all gymnosperms published so far could be folded into a general secondary structure. Variation in this secondary structure was detected among species. About 55% of the 120 bp nucleotide positions was variable, in which 68% was on stem regions. Nevertheless, the positions at the end of the stems and those adjacent to loops are conserved. Their stability directly determines the size of the loops. Some mutations such as compensatory base-pair substitutions, and G-U pairing could be regarded as mechanisms for maintaining a stable secondary structure. The loops of the secondary structure are also relatively conserved. It seems that stable helices are necessary for the function of the gene. The conserved nucleotides in the loops are probably involved in the interaction with proteins and/or RNAs or with other nucleotide in the formation of the tertiary structure. However, unlike other reports, Loop E was found quite mutable among pines. These variations together with those on stems might be caused by the presence of pseudogenes among our clones. A preliminary evaluation indicates that only seven of 50 unique sequences are potentially functional genes."

The Asian pine results provided no support for the latitudinal hypothesis; Asian tropical pine species did not have smaller genomes than their temperate or boreal relatives. DNA content of haploid megagametophyte tissue varied from 21.85 pg/C for hard pine Pinus densiflora Sieb. & Zucc. to 29.59 pg/C for soft pine Pinus bungeana Zucc. Pinus merkusii Jung. & De Vriese (29.63 pg/C) was the exceptional hard pine, with a genome size larger than many soft pines. The mean DNA content of Asian soft pines exceeded Asian hard pines (Delta 3.22 pg/C), a parallel to the previously reported trends for New World pines. No continental effect was detected. Based on 46 pines species sampled in centers of species diversity in Asian and the New World, soft pines had mean DNA content which exceeded hard pines by 4.97 pg/C."
[Variation of dormancy characteristic of different Pinus bungeana seed sources].,"['Wang, X', 'Liu, J', 'Wang, J']","Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology / Zhongguo sheng tai xue xue hui, Zhongguo ke xue yuan Shenyang ying yong sheng tai yan jiu suo zhu ban",NA,2000-Feb,0,"Studies on the dormancy characteristics of Pinus bungeana seeds from 7 representative seed sources show that the difference of water permeability of seed capsule was very significant among seed sources. The seeds from northern part of distribution area had a much higher water permeability than from the south. According to water permeability, the seven seed sources were divided into 2 geographical groups, with Qinling Mountain as the division line. The difference of seed ventilation was caused firstly by outer seed capsule, and secondly by inner one. The variation of permeability had a similar trend with the ventilation. The inhibition ability of seed extracts was significantly different among different seed sources, which was increased with the concentration of seed extracts. Based on the inhibition ability of extracts from seed capsule and endosperm, the seven seed sources were divided into 2 and 3 geographical groups, respectively. The germination capacity decreased with increasing latitude, and seeds with poor germination capacity took relatively more time for germination. All population groups based on different division criteria showed such a character, i.e., the difference of seed characteristics was more significant among groups than in same group, and the distance of seed source was longer among groups than in a group. The difference of dormancy characteristics of different P. bungeana seed sources was the result of interaction between climatic and geographical factors."
