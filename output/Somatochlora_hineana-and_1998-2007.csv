"Evaluating the non-consumptive, positive effects of a predator in the persistence of an endangered species","['Pintor, LM', 'Soluk, DA']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2006.01.021,JUL 2006,13,"Failure to consider both the consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predators on prey can lead to erroneous conclusions about the net effect of the relationship. The predatory devil crayfish, Cambarus diogenes Girard functions as an ecosystem engineer constructing extensive burrow systems through aquatic habitats. Despite crayfish posing a serious predation threat, preliminary data indicate that the federally endangered Hines Emerald dragonfly larvae, Somatochlora hineana Williamson regularly inhabit crayfish burrows. During late summer, S. hineana larval habitat dries up; leaving crayfish burrows as some of the only wetted habitats. Thus, C. diogenes can affect S. hineana through both direct, negative and indirect positive effects. We examined the positive role of crayfish burrows as drought refuges, and the threat of predation by C. diogenes on S. hineana larvae. Monthly field sampling indicated that S. hineana use open channel areas in spring and early summer moving into burrow systems in mid summer when channel areas normally dry. Laboratory experiments and field observations confirmed that crayfish prey on S. hineana larvae. Adult crayfish were a larger predation threat than juvenile crayfish. Despite their negative predatory impact, removal of crayfish from burrows in the field did not enhance densities of S. hineana larvae. Although S. hineana may face the threat of predation in burrows, they face a greater risk of desiccation if they remain in the open channel. These results lead to the counterintuitive conclusion that the maintenance of a predator is important for conserving an endangered prey species. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Protecting more than the wetland: The importance of biased sex ratios and habitat segregation for conservation of the Hine's emerald dragonfly, Somatochloya hineana Williamson","['Foster, SE', 'Soluk, DA']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2005.08.006,JAN 2006,22,"Within species habitat use may depend on age, season or sex of an individual. The distribution of males and females may vary both temporally and spatially due to differences in the costs of reproduction and the distribution of critical resources. Conservation of a species requires knowledge of the habitat use of both sexes in order to predict the population size and protect all habitats that a species requires. Adult dragonfly populations often have highly male-biased sex ratios at the breeding habitat. This bias has been attributed to females using alternative habitats to avoid male harassment, or to high female mortality. We monitored adult Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana Williamson) populations, in breeding and non-breeding habitats in Door County, Wisconsin and found significant differences in habitat use between males and females. Males primarily used wetland habitats, while females primarily used dry meadows and marginal breeding habitats, only coming into wetlands to lay-eggs or find mates. We assessed food resources in the different habitats and found that high quality insect prey (primarily adult Diptera) were more available in the wetland habitat, indicating that these areas were likely a more productive foraging area for adult dragonflies. The fact that females appear to avoid the wetland habitat is consistent with the hypothesis that male harassment alters female distribution patterns. Consideration of the patterns of habitat use by S. hineana indicates the need to develop a broader understanding of the importance of non-wetland areas in the conservation of wetland species.

"Evaluating exuvia collection as a management tool for the federally endangered Hine's emerald dragonfly, Somatochlora hineana Williamson (Odonata: Cordulidae)","['Foster, SE', 'Soluk, DA']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2003.06.002,JUN 2004,16,"Reliable population density estimates are crucial for monitoring endangered species. Many species are difficult to capture or range over large areas, making direct monitoring of populations through capture or observation extremely challenging. In such cases, indirect methods of assessing populations can be the only source of reliable information. We examined whether the discarded exoskeleton of the last larval instar (exuvia), left behind when dragonflies emerge into the adult stage, could be used to predict larval densities and provide life history information for the federally listed endangered, Hine's Emerald Dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana). Using standardized protocols, we collected exuvia within six 2 x 2 in plots in an ephemeral wetland in Door County, Wisconsin during spring and summer of 1999 and 2000. S. hineana is a ""summer emerger"", with more than 95% of the emergence occurring from late June until mid-Juh. Based on time of emergence and the flight period, adults appear to live a month or longer. The sex ratio at emergence did not differ significantly from a 1:1 ratio and emergence was synchronous between the sexes. Estimates of larval population density using exuvial data were similar to those obtained through intensive direct sampling for larvae. Exuvial collections provide a reliable estimate of larval population density, help link larval ecology to adult ecology and are a useful tool for assessing habitat suitability. Although sampling exuviae requires repeated searching on particular sites, less expertise and fewer people are required for this type of sampling, indicating that exuvial surveys can be a very effective tool for monitoring populations of endangered dragonflies.

New distribution records of Somatochlora hineana (Odonata : Corduliidae),"['Steffens, WP']",GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST,NA,SPR 1998,0,"New records for Somatochlora hineana in Michigan are reported, extending the known distribution of the species by nearly 200 km to the northeast. Habitats are rich fens with shallow creeks, springs, small pools, and marl deposits."
