Snake (Colubridae : Thamnophis) predatory responses to chemical cues from native and introduced prey species,"['Mullin, SJ', 'Imbert, H', 'Fish, JM', 'Ervin, EL', 'Fisher, RN']",SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST,10.1894/0038-4909(2004)049<0449:SCTPRT>2.0.CO;2,DEC 2004,3,"Several aquatic vertebrates have been introduced into freshwater systems in California over the past 100 years. Some populations of the two-striped garter snake (Thamnophis hammondii) have lived in sympatry with these species since their introduction; other populations have never encountered them. To assess the possible adaptation to a novel prey, we tested the predatory responses of T. hammondii from different populations to different chemosensory cites from native and introduced prey species. We presented chemical extracts from potential prey types and 2 control odors to individual snakes on cotton swabs and recorded the number of tongue flicks and attacks directed at each swab. Subject response was higher for prey odors than control substances. Odors from introduced centrarchid fish (Lepomis) elicited higher response levels than other prey types, including native anuran larvae (Pseudacris regilla). The pattern of response was similar for both populations of snakes (experienced and naive, with respect to the introduced prey). We suggest that the generalist aquatic lifestyle of T. hammondii has allowed it to take advantage of increasing populations of introduced prey. Decisions on the management strategies for some of these introduced prey species should include consideration of how T. hammondii populations might respond in areas of sympatry."
"Geographic variation and ontogenetic change in the diet of the Mexican Pacific lowlands garter snake, Thamnophis validus","['de Queiroz, A', 'Henke, C', 'Smith, HM']",COPEIA,NA,DEC 20 2001,15,"The Mexican Pacific lowlands garter snake, Thamnophis validus, is found in aquatic habitats on the Pacific coast of Mexico from the states of Sonora to Guerrero and in the Cape Region of the Baja California peninsula. We characterized the diet of Thamnophis validus through examination of stomach contents of museum specimens and from literature records. The diet of T validus consists almost entirely of fishes and larval and adult anurans. There is strong geographic variation in the diet: snakes from uplands of Baja California contained only anurans, whereas the majority of snakes from mainland Mexico that contained prey had eaten fishes. Mainland snakes show a pronounced ontogenetic shift from feeding primarily on anurans to feeding primarily on fishes. When mainland snakes are divided into three size classes, the intermediate class shows the most generalized diet (i.e., the most even distribution between fishes and anurans). We suggest that this nonmonotonic relationship between predator size and the level of specialization may be relatively common in snakes. Prey mass and the variance in prey mass both increase with increasing predator size in T validus, as is the case for many carnivorous animals, Thamnophis validus apparently differs from other aquatic garter snakes (T. atratus, T couchii, T hammondii, T melanogaster, and T rufipunctatus) in feeding heavily on adult anurans and in the common use of aquatic open-mouth searching behavior."
