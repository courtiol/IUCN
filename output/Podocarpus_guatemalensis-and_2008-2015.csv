"Structural and diversity analysis of Abies forests from Jalisco, Mexico","['Cuevas-Guzman, R', 'Cisneros-Lepe, EA', 'Jardel-Pelaez, EJ', 'Sanchez-Rodriguez, EV', 'Guzman-Hernandez, L', 'Nunez-Lopez, NM', 'Rodriguez-Guerrero, C']",REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD,NA,DEC 2011,3,"Structure, floristic composition and diversity in Abies forests were determined in twenty-four 0.1 ha plots in 5 areas in Jalisco State. The resulting attributes were compared between areas. Sixty four species, 47 genera and 35 families were recorded. The families Asteraceae, Pinaceae and Fagaceae, as well as the genera Quercus, Pinus and Ales had the highest species richness. More than half (56%) of the individuals had a height ranging between 2 and 14 m with Abies religiosa var. emarginata, A. gualemalensis var.jaliscana,Quercus xalapensis and A. religiosa var. religiosa presenting the taller trees. The highest density values, basal area, frequency and importance values were for A. religiosa, var. emarginata, A. religiosa var. religiosa, Pinus pseudostrobus y Podocarpus matudae. Individuals of the species presented an inverted ""J""- shaped diameter distribution, while no statistical significant differences were observed for richness and species diversity in the 5 study areas. Average similarity between plots in the 5 areas presented significant differences in 4 of the plots. Despite being quite different in floristic composition, Abies forests in Jalisco were similar in structure, diversity and richness. The presence of tall individuals and emergent trees in all strata suggests a good regeneration capacity in the communities of the 5 areas studied."
CUTICLE MICROMORPHOLOGY OF CARIBBEAN AND CENTRAL AMERICAN SPECIES OF PODOCARPUS (PODOCARPACEAE),"['Schilling, DMS', 'Mill, RR', 'LAUBENFELS PODOCARPACEAE']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES,10.1086/659460,JUN 2011,2,"The cuticle micromorphology of leaves of 13 species of Podocarpus (Podocarpaceae), nine from the Caribbean Islands and four from Central America, was studied with scanning electron microscopy. They include five of the seven species of section Pumilis (Podocarpus aristulatus, P. buchii, P. ekmanii, P. urbanii, and P. victorinianus), four of the seven species of section Nemoralis (P. guatemalensis, P. hispaniolensis, P. purdieanus, and P. trinitensis), three of the six species of section Lanceolatus (P. coriaceus, P. costaricensis, and P. matudae), and one of the three species of section Pratensis (P. oleifolius). The external and internal features of the adaxial and abaxial cuticles are described for all species and are compared with other known Podocarpus species (especially section Scytopodium). Leaves are hypostomatic, with stomata arranged in discontinuous rows parallel to the leaf axis. The external cuticles of all studied species possessed Florin rings. Stomatal plugs were observed in all species except P. buchii and P. costaricensis. The number of subsidiary cells varies from two to six, with two or three being most common. Polar subsidiary cells are constantly absent in seven species and present in six species, although in three of these, they are sometimes absent. The internal cuticle on subsidiary cell surfaces is smooth to slightly rugose and is sometimes pitted. The cuticle on guard cell surfaces is usually granular to rugose, sometimes with pits. Polar extensions occur in all species; they are thin in the studied species of section Pumilis but thick in those belonging to the other three sections. Epidermal cell outlines are straight to undulating. The cuticle on epidermal cell surfaces is rugose and pitted in all the Caribbean species except for P. trinitensis but much smoother to granular in P. trinitensis and the Central American species. The most useful characters to distinguish species are the micromorphology of the cuticle on guard cell surfaces, the presence or absence of polar subsidiary cells, the periclinal epidermal cell texture, and the epidermal cell shape and size. No synapomorphic characters of the leaf cuticle were found that supported any of the sections proposed in the 1985 revision of Podocarpus by de Laubenfels, but some qualitative characters were correlated with geographical distribution. Quantitative characters showed considerable variation between species, often providing distinguishing characters, but none of this variation was correlated either with the current taxonomic classification or with geography."
