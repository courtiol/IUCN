From malaria parasite point of view - Plasmodium falciparum evolution,"['Zerka, A', 'Kaczmarek, R', 'Jaskiewicz, E']",POSTEPY HIGIENY I MEDYCYNY DOSWIADCZALNEJ,NA,DEC 31 2015,0,"Malaria is caused by infection with protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium, which have arguably exerted the greatest selection pressure on humans in the history of our species. Besides humans, different Plasmodium parasites infect a wide range of animal hosts, from marine invertebrates to primates. On the other hand, individual Plasmodium species show high host specificity. The extraordinary evolution of Plasmodium probably began when a free-living red algae turned parasitic, and culminated with its ability to thrive inside a human red blood cell. Studies on the African apes generated new data on the evolution of malaria parasites in general and the deadliest human-specific species, Plasmodium falciparum, in particular. Initially, it was hypothesized that P. falciparum descended from the chimpanzee malaria parasite P. reichenowi, after the human and the chimp lineage diverged about 6 million years ago. However, a recently identified new species infecting gorillas, unexpectedly showed similarity to P. falciparum and was therefore named P. praefalciparum. That finding spurred an alternative hypothesis, which proposes that P. falciparum descended from its gorilla rather than chimp counterpart. In addition, the gorilla-to-human host shift may have occurred more recently (about 10 thousand years ago) than the theoretical P. falciparum-P. reichenowi split.

One of the key aims of the studies on Plasmodium evolution is to elucidate the mechanisms that allow the incessant host shifting and retaining the host specificity, especially in the case of human-specific species. Thorough understanding of these phenomena will be necessary to design effective malaria treatment and prevention strategies."
Diversity of Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotypes among small rodents in southwestern Poland,"['Perec-Matysiak, A', 'Bunkowska-Gawlik, K', 'Kvac, M', 'Sak, B', 'Hildebrand, J', 'Lesnianska, K']",VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.10.018,DEC 15 2015,0,"Diversity of Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotypes in wild small rodent populations still remains incomplete and only few molecular studies have been conducted among these hosts. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether small rodents, i.e., Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus flavicollis, Mus musculus and Myodes glareolus act as hosts of E. bieneusi and can play an important role in spore spreading in the environment of south-western Poland. Molecular analyses were conducted to determine pathogen genotypes. A total of 191 fecal and 251 spleen samples collected from 311 rodent individuals were examined for the occurrence of E. bieneusi by PCR amplifying ITS gene. The overall prevalence of E. bieneusi in rodent samples was 38.9%. The nucleotide sequences of ITS region of E bieneusi revealed the presence a total of 12 genotypes with two being already known, i.e., D and gorilla 1 genotypes. The remaining ten are novel genotypes (WR1-WR10) which segregated into three groups in a neighbor joining phylogeny. This study reports for the first time E. bieneusi occurrence in wild living rodents in Poland and shows extensive genetic diversity within E. bieneusi isolates of rodent origin.

Results: Here the genome sequence of wild-born African cheetahs reveals extreme genomic depletion in SNV incidence, SNV density, SNVs of coding genes, MHC class I and II genes, and mitochondrial DNA SNVs. Cheetah genomes are on average 95 % homozygous compared to the genomes of the outbred domestic cat (24.08 % homozygous), Virunga Mountain Gorilla (78.12 %), inbred Abyssinian cat (62.63 %), Tasmanian devil, domestic dog and other mammalian species. Demographic estimators impute two ancestral population bottlenecks: one >100,000 years ago coincident with cheetah migrations out of the Americas and into Eurasia and Africa, and a second 11,084-12,589 years ago in Africa coincident with late Pleistocene large mammal extinctions. MHC class I gene loss and dramatic reduction in functional diversity of MHC genes would explain why cheetahs ablate skin graft rejection among unrelated individuals. Significant excess of non-synonymous mutations in AKAP4 (p < 0.02), a gene mediating spermatozoon development, indicates cheetah fixation of five function-damaging amino acid variants distinct from AKAP4 homologues of other Felidae or mammals; AKAP4 dysfunction may cause the cheetah's extremely high (>80 %) pleiomorphic sperm.

Conclusions: The study provides an unprecedented genomic perspective for the rare cheetah, with potential relevance to the species' natural history, physiological adaptations and unique reproductive disposition."
Profiling unauthorized natural resource users for better targeting of conservation interventions,"['Harrison, M', 'Baker, J', 'Twinamatsiko, M', 'Milner-Gulland, EJ']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/cobi.12575,DEC 2015,0,"Unauthorized use of natural resources is a key threat tomany protected areas. Approaches to reducing this threat include law enforcement and integrated conservation and development (ICD) projects, but for such ICDs to be targeted effectively, it is important to understand who is illegally using which natural resources and why. The nature of unauthorized behavior makes it difficult to ascertain this information through direct questioning. Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, has many ICD projects, including authorizing some local people to use certain nontimber forest resources from the park. However, despite over 25 years of ICD, unauthorized resource use continues. We used household surveys, indirect questioning (unmatched count technique), and focus group discussions to generate profiles of authorized and unauthorized resource users and to explore motivations for unauthorized activity. Overall, unauthorized resource use was most common among people from poor households who lived closest to the park boundary and farthest from roads and trading centers. Other motivations for unauthorized resource use included crop raiding by wild animals, inequity of revenue sharing, and lack of employment, factors that created resentment among the poorest communities. In some communities, benefits obtained from ICD were reported to be the greatest deterrents against unauthorized activity, although law enforcement ranked highest overall. Despite the sensitive nature of exploring unauthorized resource use, management-relevant insights into the profiles and motivations of unauthorized resource users can be gained from a combination of survey techniques, as adopted here. To reduce unauthorized activity at Bwindi, we suggest ICD benefit the poorest people living in remote areas and near the park boundary by providing affordable alternative sources of forest products and addressing crop raiding. To prevent resentment from driving further unauthorized activity, ICDs should be managed transparently and equitably."

"Conservation research presence protects: a case study of great ape abundance in the Dja region, Cameroon","['Tagg, N', 'Willie, J', 'Duarte, J', 'Petre, CA', 'Fa, JE']",ANIMAL CONSERVATION,10.1111/acv.12212,DEC 2015,1,"Research programmes have been shown to exert a positive impact on faunal communities, but few studies provide empirical evidence. In this study, we surveyed three neighbouring sites, differing in terms of official protection status and level of active management, in the Dja Conservation Complex, southeast Cameroon. We recorded signs of human activity and anthropogenic pressures and found that they significantly differed by site. We assessed chimpanzee and gorilla relative abundance using nest count surveys. We found that chimpanzee nest abundance was related to the presence of active management, but both active management and availability of suitable habitat affected gorilla nest abundance. Our results suggest that gorillas are more tolerant of human activity. We also provide evidence that the presence and activities of the conservation research project Projet Grands Singes served to actively deter poachers and limit hunting of great apes as a result of researcher presence, community sensitization and of valuing living apes and intact forests by local people. Such empirical evidence for the positive effect of research activity on biodiversity preservation should encourage continued investment in such programmes as part of a landscape-wide, multi-stakeholder conservation management of great ape habitats."
Long-Term Spatial Memory and Learning Set Formation in Captive Capuchin Monkeys (Cebus libidinosus = Sapajus cay),"['Tujague, MP', 'Janson, CH', 'Lahitte, HB']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-015-9878-5,DEC 2015,0,"Researchers have long suspected that nonhuman primates have long-term spatial memory for locating food. However, few empirical studies have assessed spatial memory for a period longer than 1 day in nonhuman primates in a foraging context. We used a modified version of the radial maze to test long-term memory for periods of 2 days or longer in two groups of Cebus libidinosus = Sapajus cay (N = 10; N = 6) in captivity (environment completely human constructed) and semicaptivity (relatively natural environment with few human-made structures) at La Plata Zoo and Botanical Park, Buenos Aires, Argentina, between 2007 and 2010. The experimental design included a set of three accessible baited feeders interspersed among three nonaccessible baited feeders. We tested monkeys in one initial exposure period, four periods of long-term memory (2 days, 76 days, 76 + 2 days, and 4 months of delay), and one period of inversion of the experimental set location. We used the latter to analyze the monkeys' abilities to develop learning sets. Captive subjects appeared to remember sites with accessible and nonaccessible food for periods of 2 days, 76 days, and 4 months, and used learning sets to reduce relearning times when exposed to a change in the learned locations. Although semicaptive subjects also appeared to remember sites with accessible and nonaccessible food, their performance was less accurate. We conclude that capuchins used spatial memory to improve their foraging efficiency."
Implications of the Relationship Between Basicranial Flexion and Facial Orientation for the Evolution of Hominid Craniofacial Structures,"['Neaux, D', 'Gilissen, E', 'Coudyzer, W', 'Guy, F']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-015-9886-5,DEC 2015,0,"The basicranium and face have been linked through genetic, developmental, and functional relationships throughout their evolution. As a result, basicranial morphology most likely plays a major role in the evolution of facial structures. We describe the relationships between basicranial flexion and the face in Homo, Pan, and Gorilla to determine the role of cranial base angle reduction in the setup of the short and orthognathic face of Homo. We test the hypotheses that cranial base flexion plays a significant part in variation in facial orientation, length, and projection at the intraspecific level. The sample comprised 125 crania of adult specimens including 66 Homo sapiens, 32 Pan troglodytes, and 27 Gorilla gorilla. We described the cranial base and face using landmarks placed on scans of the surfaces and computed correlations between the cranial base angle and facial orientation, length, and projection. Our results support the hypotheses that cranial base flexion plays a significant part in facial orientation for Homo and Pan and in facial length for Pan. The hypothesis that basicranial flexion is related to a reduction of facial projection is not supported. The findings suggest that basicranial flexion can explain several anatomical specificities of hominins, including the reduction of prognathism and the reduction of the length of the nasopharynx. We found different patterns in the different genera, highlighting the fact that changes in the relationship between craniofacial structures may have occurred during hominid evolution."
"HIV-1 group O infection in Cameroon from 2006 to 2013: Prevalence, genetic diversity, evolution and public health challenges","['Villabona-Arenas, CJ', 'Domyeum, J', 'Mouacha, F', 'Butel, C', 'Delaporte, E', 'Peeters, M', 'Mpoudi-Ngole, E', 'Aghokeng, AF']",INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.09.006,DEC 2015,0,"The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is characterized by a tremendously high genetic diversity, leading to the currently known circulating HIV types, groups, subtypes, and recombinant forms. HIV-1 group O is one of the most diverse forms of HIV-1 and has been so far related to Cameroon or individuals originating from Cameroon. In this study, we investigated in Cameroon, the evolution of this viral group from 2006 to 2013, in terms of prevalence, genetic diversity and public health implications. Our results confirmed the predominance of HIV-1 group M (98.5%), a very low prevalence (<0.02%) for HIV-1 group N and P, and HIV-2 in this country. HIV-1 group O was found at around 0.6% (95% confidence interval: 0.4-0.8%), indicating that the frequency of this virus in Cameroon has remained stable over the last decades. However, we found an extensive high genetic diversity within this HIV-1 group, that resulted from previous steady increase on the effective number of HIV-1 group O infections through time, and the current distribution of the circulating viral strains still does not allow classification as subtypes. The frequency of dual infections with HIV-1 group M and group O was 0.8% (95% confidence interval: 0.6-1.0%), but we found no recombinant forms in co-infected patients. Natural resistance to integrase inhibitors was not identified, although we found several mutations considered as natural polymorphisms. Our study shows that infections with HIV-1 group O can be adequately managed in countries where the virus circulates, but this complex virus still represents a challenge for diagnostics and monitoring strategies.

Assessing the Unseen Bacterial Diversity in Microbial Communities.,"['Caro-Quintero, Alejandro', 'Ochman, Howard']",Genome biology and evolution,10.1093/gbe/evv234,2015 Nov 27,0,"For both historical and technical reasons, 16S ribosomal RNA has been the most common molecular marker used to analyze the contents of microbial communities. However, its slow rate of evolution hinders the resolution of closely related bacteria-individual 16S-phylotypes, particularly when clustered at 97% sequence identity, conceal vast amounts of species- and strain-level variation. Protein-coding genes, which evolve more quickly, are useful for differentiating among more recently diverged lineages, but their application is complicated by difficulties in designing low-redundancy primers that amplify homologous regions from distantly related taxa. Given the now-common practice of multiplexing hundreds of samples, adopting new genes usually entails the synthesis of large sets of barcoded primers. To circumvent problems associated with use of protein-coding genes to survey microbial communities, we develop an approach-termed phyloTAGs-that offers an automatic solution for primer design and can be easily adapted to target different taxonomic groups and/or different protein-coding regions. We applied this method to analyze diversity within the gorilla gut microbiome and recovered hundreds of strains that went undetected after deep-sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons. PhyloTAGs provides a powerful way to recover the fine-level diversity within microbial communities and to study stability and dynamics of bacterial populations.   The Author(s) 2015.

"Cocirculation of Two env Molecular Variants, of Possible Recombinant Origin, in Gorilla and Chimpanzee Simian Foamy Virus Strains from Central Africa","['Richard, L', 'Rua, R', 'Betsem, E', 'Mouinga-Ondeme, A', 'Kazanji, M', 'Leroy, E', 'Njouom, R', 'Buseyne, F', 'Afonso, PV', 'Gessain, A']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.01798-15,DEC 2015,0,"Simian foamy virus (SFV) is a ubiquitous retrovirus in nonhuman primates (NHPs) that can be transmitted to humans, mostly through severe bites. In the past few years, our laboratory has identified more than 50 hunters from central Africa infected with zoonotic SFVs. Analysis of the complete sequences of five SFVs obtained from these individuals revealed that env was the most variable gene. Furthermore, recombinant SFV strains, some of which involve sequences in the env gene, were recently identified. Here, we investigated the variability of the env genes of zoonotic SFV strains and searched for possible recombinants. We sequenced the complete env gene or its surface glycoprotein region (SU) from DNA amplified from the blood of (i) a series of 40 individuals from Cameroon or Gabon infected with a gorilla or chimpanzee foamy virus (FV) strain and (ii) 1 gorilla and 3 infected chimpanzees living in the same areas as these hunters. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of two env variants among both the gorilla and chimpanzee FV strains that were present in zoonotic and NHP strains. These variants differ greatly (>30% variability) in a 753-bp-long region located in the receptor-binding domain of SU, whereas the rest of the gene is very conserved. Although the organizations of the Env protein sequences are similar, the potential glycosylation patterns differ between variants. Analysis of recombination suggests that the variants emerged through recombination between different strains, although all parental strains could not be identified.

IMPORTANCE

SFV infection in humans is a great example of a zoonotic retroviral infection that has not spread among human populations, in contrast to human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) and human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs). Recombination was a major mechanism leading to the emergence of HIV. Here, we show that two SFV molecular envelope gene variants circulate among ape populations in Central Africa and that both can be transmitted to humans. These variants differ greatly in the SU region that corresponds to the part of the Env protein in contact with the environment. These variants may have emerged through recombination between SFV strains infecting different NHP species."
Toward the integration of optical sensors in smartphone screens using femtosecond laser writing,"['Lapointe, J', 'Parent, F', 'de Lima, ES', 'Loranger, S', 'Kashyap, R']",OPTICS LETTERS,10.1364/OL.40.005654,DEC 1 2015,0,"We demonstrate a new type of sensor incorporated directly into Corning Gorilla glass, an ultraresistant glass widely used in the screen of popular devices such as smartphones, tablets, and smart watches. Although physical space is limited in portable devices, the screens have been so far neglected in regard to functionalization. Our proof-of-concept shows a new niche for photonics device development, in which the screen becomes an active component integrated into the device. The sensor itself is a near-surface waveguide, sensitive to refractive index changes, enabling the analysis of liquids directly on the screen of a smart-phone, without the need for any add-ons, thus opening this part of the device to advanced functionalization. The primary function of the screen is unaffected, since the sensor and waveguide are effectively invisible to the naked eye. We fabricated a waveguide just below the glass surface, directly written without any surface preparation, in which the change in refractive index on the surface-air interface changes the light guidance, thus the transmission of light. This work reports on sensor fabrication, using a femtosecond pulsed laser, and the light-interaction model of the beam propagating at the surface is discussed and compared with experimental measurement for refractive indexes in the range 1.3-1.7. A new and improved model, including input and output reflections due to the effective mode index change, is also proposed and yields a better match with our experimental measurements and also with previous measurements reported in the literature.

"Forearm articular proportions and the antebrachial index in Homo sapiens, Australopithecus afarensis and the great apes","['Williams, FL', 'Cunningham, DL', 'Amaral, LQ']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jchb.2015.07.001,2015,0,"When hominin bipedality evolved, the forearms were free to adopt nonlocomotor tasks which may have resulted in changes to the articular surfaces of the ulna and the relative lengths of the forearm bones. Similarly, sex differences in forearm proportions may be more likely to emerge in bipeds than in the great apes given the locomotor constraints in Gorilla, Pan and Pongo. To test these assumptions, ulnar articular proportions and the antebrachial index (radius length/ulna length) in Homo sapiens (n=51), Gorilla gorilla (n=88), Pan troglodytes (n=49), Pongo pygrnaeus (n=36) and Australopithecus afarensis A.L. 288-1 and A.L. 438-1 are compared. Intercept-adjusted ratios are used to control for size and minimize the effects of allometry. Canonical scores axes show that the proximally broad and elongated trochlear notch with respect to size in H. sapiens and A. afarensis is largely distinct from G. gorilla, P. troglodytes and P. pygmaeus. A cluster analysis of scaled ulnar articular dimensions groups H. sapiens males with A.L. 438-1 ulna length estimates, while one A.L. 288-1 ulna length estimate groups with Pan and another clusters most closely with H. sapiens, G. gorilla and A.L. 438-1. The relatively low antebrachial index Characterizing H. sapiens and non-outlier estimates of A.L. 288-1 and A.L. 438-1 differs from those of the great apes. Unique sex differences in H. sapiens suggest a link between bipedality and forearm functional morphology. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."
"Audience effects, but not environmental influences, explain variation in gorilla close distance vocalizations-A test of the acoustic adaptation hypothesis","['Hedwig, D', 'Mundry, R', 'Robbins, MM', 'Boesch, C']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22462,DEC 2015,0,"Close distance vocalizations are an integral part of primate vocal communication. They exhibit large acoustic variation which has been suggested to constitute flexible responses to the highly variable social setting of group living animals. However, a recent study suggested that acoustic variation in close distance calls of baboons may also arise from acoustic adaptations to environmental factors in order to counteract sound degradation. We tested whether the variation in calling rate and acoustic structure of gorilla close distance vocalizations may serve to counteract distorting effects of vegetation during sound propagation. Using focal animal sampling we recorded the vocal behavior of 15 adult individuals living in two groups: one group of western lowland gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla and one group of mountain gorillas Gorilla beringei beringei. We considered the distance between the caller and its nearest neighbor as the minimum transmission distance of calls; while vegetation density was quantified through measures of visibility. Our analysis revealed vocal plasticity in gorilla close calls in relation to changes in visibility and nearest neighbor distance. However, the observed changes in fundamental frequency and calling rate are unlikely to counteract degrading effects of vegetation, but rather seem to reflect reactions to variation in spatial and visual separation from other group members, similar to the audience effects demonstrated in a range of other species. We propose that vocal plasticity to counteract distorting environmental effects may not be prevalent across taxa and perhaps confined to species living in heterogeneous habitats with highly variable transmission conditions.

Agonism and dominance in female blue monkeys,"['Klass, K', 'Cords, M']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22481,DEC 2015,0,"Agonistic behavior features prominently in hypotheses that explain how social variation relates to ecological factors and phylogenetic constraints. Dominance systems vary along axes of despotism, tolerance, and nepotism, and comparative studies examine cross-species patterns in these classifications. To contribute to such studies, we present a comprehensive picture of agonistic behavior and dominance relationships in wild female blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis), an arboreal guenon, with data from 9 groups spanning 18 years. We assessed where blue monkeys fall along despotic, tolerant, and nepotistic spectra, how their dominance system compares to other primates, primarily cercopithecines, and whether their agonistic behavior matches socioecological model predictions. Blue monkeys showed low rates of mainly low-intensity agonism and little counter-aggression. Rates increased with rank and group size. Dominance asymmetry varied at different organizational levels, being more pronounced at the level of interactions than dyad or group. Hierarchies were quite stable, had moderate-to-high linearity and directional consistency and moderate steepness. There was clear maternal rank inheritance, but inconsistent adherence to Kawamura's rules. There was little between-group variation, although hierarchy metrics showed considerable variation across group-years. Overall, blue monkeys have moderately despotic, moderately tolerant, and nepotistic dominance hierarchies. They resemble other cercopithecines in having significantly linear and steep hierarchies with a generally stable, matriline-based structure, suggesting a phylogenetic basis to this aspect of their social system. Blue monkeys most closely match Sterck et al.'s [1997] Resident-Nepotistic-Tolerant dominance category, although they do not fully conform to predictions of any one socioecological model. Our results suggest that socioecological models might better predict variation within than across clades, thereby incorporating both ecological variables and phylogenetic constraints. Our findings also highlight the need for clearer definitions of socioecologically relevant dominance categories, which would ideally derive from quantitative measures of dominance behavior. Intraspecific and methodological variation may, however, be a challenge. Am. J. Primatol. 77:1299-1315, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Despite their longevity and phylogenetic relatedness to humans, the effects of aging on motor function in non-human apes have been minimally studied. We conducted two experiments with western lowland gorillas (11-54 years of age) to determine whether aged gorillas exhibit motor deficits similar to those seen in other species. In experiment one, gorillas extracted up to 12 food rewards lodged in holes of a Lexan board. Extraction rates were calculated for eight test sessions. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed no main effects of session or sex on extraction rate, but a significant main effect of age. Comparisons between the first and last sessions showed that experience significantly improved extraction rates in young but not aged gorillas. In experiment two, gorillas retrieved a hex nut from three differently shaped rods with each hand for a reward. Latencies of retrieval were calculated for 16 test sessions. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant main effects of age class, sex, and session. There were significant interactions between session and sex, session and age, and session, sex, and age. These findings held when analyzing each rod shape separately. Post hoc comparisons revealed that young gorillas were significantly faster at the task than aged gorillas, and females were faster than males. This finding held only for the question mark shaped rod when analyzing each rod shape separately. Comparisons between the first and last sessions showed that experience did not significantly improve latencies in either age or sex class. The direction of these results are congruent with previous findings in humans and monkeys and suggest that aged gorillas experience deficits in bimanual coordination compared to younger gorillas and that age and sex influence fine motor ability in gorillas.

The recent development of non-invasive methods allowed re-exploration of plasmodial diversity in African apes. Although a large number of great ape populations have now been studied regarding Plasmodium infections in Africa, there are still vast areas of their distribution that remained unexplored. Gabon constitutes an important part of the range of western central African great ape subspecies (Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla), but has not been studied so far. In the present study, the diversity of Plasmodium species circulating in great apes in Gabon was analysed.

METHODS: The analysis of 1,261 faecal samples from 791 chimpanzees and 470 gorillas collected from 24 sites all over Gabon was performed. Plasmodium infections were characterized by amplification and sequencing of a portion of the Plasmodium cytochrome b gene.

RESULTS: The analysis of the 1,261 samples revealed that at least six Plasmodium species circulate in great apes in Gabon (Plasmodium praefalciparum, Plasmodium gorA (syn Plasmodium adleri), Plasmodium gorB (syn Plasmodium blacklocki) in gorillas and Plasmodium gaboni, P. reichenowi and Plasmodium billcollinsi in chimpanzees). No new phylogenetic lineages were discovered. The average infection rate was 21.3% for gorillas and 15.4% for chimpanzees. A logistic regression showed that the probability of infection was significantly dependent on the freshness of the droppings but not of the host species or of the average pluviometry of the months of collection."

In the initial study, we assessed the influence of grip morphology on hand use for simple reaching in a sample of 564 great apes including 49 orangutans Pongo pygmaeus, 66 gorillas Gorilla gorilla, 354 chimpanzees Pan troglodytes and 95 bonobos Pan paniscus. Overall, we found a significant right hand bias for reaching. We also found a significant effect of the grip morphology of hand use. Grasping with the thumb and index finger was more prevalent in the right compared to left hand in all four species. There was no significant sex effect on the patterns of handedness. In a subsample of apes, we also compared consistency in hand use for simple reaching with previously published data on a task that measures handedness for bimanual actions. We found that the ratio of subjects with consistent right compared to left hand use was more prevalent in bonobos, chimpanzees and gorillas but not orangutans. However, for all species, the proportion of subjects with inconsistent hand preferences between the tasks was relatively high suggesting some measures may be more sensitive in assessing handedness than others."
The Season for Peace: Reconciliation in a Despotic Species (Lemur catta),"['Palagi, E', 'Norscia, I']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0142150,NOV 16 2015,0,"However despotic a social group may be, managing conflicts of interest is crucial to preserve group living benefits, mainly based on cooperation. In despotic groups, post-conflict management via reconciliation (the first post-conflict reunion between former opponents) can occur, even if conciliatory rates are considerably different. Lemur catta is defined as a despotic species because groups are characterized by a strict linear hierarchy maintained by the adult females (the dominant sex) mainly via aggression. Reconciliation was reported in one out of four captive groups of L. catta. Here we investigate which variables influence the occurrence of reconciliation in these despotic groups. We analyzed 2339 Post Conflict (PC)-Matched Control (MC) observation pairs, collected on eight groups (five in the Berenty forest, Madagascar; three hosted at the Pistoia Zoo, Italy). Since L. catta is characterized by steep female dominance but shows female-female coalitionary support, we expected to confirm the presence of reconciliation in the study species. Consistently, we found reconciliation in one captive group and two wild groups, thus providing the first evidence of the presence of this phenomenon in wild L. catta. Moreover, because this species is a seasonal breeder (with mating occurring once a year), we expected seasonal fluctuations in reconciliation levels. Via a GLMM analysis using data from all wild groups and on a captive group followed for more than one year, we found that season (but not rank; individuals' identity, sex, and age; or group identity) significantly affected individual reconciliation rates, and such rates were lowest during the mating period. Thus, reconciliation can be present in groups in which dominants strongly influence and limit social relationships (steep dominance hierarchy) except when the advantages of intra-group cooperation are overcome by competition, as occurs in seasonal breeders when reproduction is at stake. We conclude that in despotic social groups in which coalitions are observed, the right question is not if but when reconciliation can be present."
Central memory CD4+T cells are preferential targets of double infection by HIV-1,"['Haqqani, AA', 'Marek, SL', 'Kumar, J', 'Davenport, M', 'Wang, H', 'Tilton, JC']",Virology Journal,10.1186/s12985-015-0415-0,NOV 11 2015,0,"Background: Template switching between two distinct HIV-1 RNA genomes during reverse transcription gives rise to recombinant viruses that greatly expand the genetic diversity of HIV-1 and have adverse implications for drug resistance, immune escape, and vaccine design. Virions with two distinct genomes are produced exclusively from cells infected with two or more viruses, or 'doubly infected' cells. Previous studies have revealed higher than expected frequencies of doubly infected cells compared to frequencies based on chance alone, suggesting non-random enhancement of double infection.

Methods: We investigated double infection of unstimulated primary CD4+ T cells using reporter viruses carrying genes for different fluorescent proteins, EGFP and mCherry, combined with sophisticated modeling techniques based on Poisson distribution. Additionally, through the use of multiparameter flow cytometry we examined the susceptibility of naive and memory subsets of CD4+ T cells to double infection by HIV.

Results: Using our double infection system, we confirm non-random enhancement of multiple infection events. Double infection of CD4+ T cells was not found to be a consequence of suboptimal provirus expression rescued by Tat in trans-as has been reported in cell lines-but rather due to a heterogeneous cell population in which only a fraction of primary peripheral blood CD4+ T cells are susceptible to HIV infection regardless of viral titer. Intriguingly, double infection of CD4+ T cells occurred preferentially in memory CD4+ T cells-particularly the central memory (TCM) subset-but was not a consequence of SAMHD1-mediated restriction of HIV infection in naive cells.

Conclusions: These findings reveal that double infection in primary CD4+ T cells is primarily a consequences of cellular heterogeneity and not rescue of suboptimal provirus expression by Tat in trans. Additionally, we report a previously unappreciated phenomenon of enhanced double infection within primary TCM cells and suggest that these long-lived cells may serve as an archive that drive ongoing viral recombination events in vivo."
Ghost-in-the-Machine reveals human social signals for human-robot interaction,"['Loth, S', 'Jettka, K', 'Giuliani, M', 'de Ruiter, JP']",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01641,NOV 4 2015,0,"We used a new method called ""Ghost-in-the-Machine"" (GiM) to investigate social interactions with a robotic bartender taking orders for drinks and serving them. Using the GiM paradigm allowed us to identify how human participants recognize the intentions of customers on the basis of the output of the robotic recognizers. Specifically, we measured which recognizer modalities (e.g., speech, the distance to the bar) were relevant at different stages of the interaction. This provided insights into human social behavior necessary for the development of socially competent robots. When initiating the drink-order interaction, the most important recognizers were those based on computer vision. When drink orders were being placed, however, the most important information source was the speech recognition. Interestingly, the participants used only a subset of the available information, focussing only on a few relevant recognizers while ignoring others. This reduced the risk of acting on erroneous sensor data and enabled them to complete service interactions more swiftly than a robot using all available sensor data. We also investigated socially appropriate response strategies. In their responses, the participants preferred to use the same modality as the customer's requests, e.g., they tended to respond verbally to verbal requests. Also, they added redundancy to their responses, for instance by using echo questions. We argue that incorporating the social strategies discovered with the GiM paradigm in multimodal grammars of human robot interactions improves the robustness and the ease-of-use of these interactions, and therefore provides a smoother user experience."
TRACK - A new method for the evaluation of low-level extinction coefficient in optical films,"['Vernhes, R', 'Martinu, L']",OPTICS EXPRESS,10.1364/OE.23.028501,NOV 2 2015,0,"We develop a rigorous methodology named TRACK based on the collection of multi-angle spectrophotometric transmission and reflection data in order to assess the extinction coefficient of quasi-transparent optical films. The accuracy of extinction coefficient values obtained by this method is not affected by sample non-idealities (thickness non-uniformity, refractive index inhomogeneities, anisotropy, interfaces, etc.) and therefore a simple two-layer (substrate/film) optical model can be used. The method requires the acquisition of transmission and reflection data at two angles of incidence: 10 degrees and 65 degrees in p polarization. Data acquired at 10 degrees provide information about the film thickness and the refractive index, while data collected at 65 degrees are used for absorption evaluation and extinction coefficient computation. We test this method on three types of samples: (i) a CR-39 plastic substrate coated with a thick protective coating; (ii) the same substrate coated with a thin TiO2 film; (iii) and a thick Si3N4 film deposited on Gorilla glass that presents thickness non-uniformity and refractive index gradient non-idealities. We also compare absorption and extinction coefficient values obtained at 410 and 550 nm by both TRACK and Laser Induced Deflection techniques in the case of a 1 micron thick TiO2 coating. Both methods display consistent extinction coefficient values in the 10(-4) and 10(-5) ranges at 410 and 550 nm, respectively, which proves the validity of the methodology and provides an estimate of its accuracy limit.

Western Lowland Gorilla (Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla) Birth Patterns and Human Presence in Zoological Settings,"['Kurtycz, LMB', 'Ross, SR']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21243,NOV-DEC 2015,0,"There is some evidence to suggest that zoo visitors may have a disruptive impact on zoo-housed animals, especially primates. While some consider western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) to be particularly reactive to large crowds, the evidence of these effects is mixed, and is likely highly influenced by exhibit design, and group composition. While the majority of studies have focused on behavioral responses to human presence, there is the potential for physiological effects as well, including the possibility of affecting the timing of parturition. Such effects have been demonstrated in laboratory-housed callitrichids and chimpanzees, but unlike laboratory settings where human presence is lowest during the weekends, human presence might peak during weekends in public zoo settings. However, in a study of zoo-housed chimpanzees, there were no significant differences between the number of chimpanzee births that occurred on weekdays compared to weekends [Wagner and Ross, 2008], and we sought to test these questions with gorillas. We analyzed the timing of 336 live gorilla births and 48 stillbirths at 53 accredited North American zoos from 1985-2014, and similarly to chimpanzees, found no weekend or weekday effect on number of births (live births: G = 0.000, p = 1; stillbirths: G = 0.166, p < 0.684). These data add to our understanding of the potential influence of human presence on primate behavior and physiology, and add to evidence suggesting that the effects of zoo visitors on exhibited species may be less profound than previously assumed.

Results: We report the first two cases of cleft lip in wild chimpanzees. Additionally, some other chimpanzees in the Sebitoli community show facial dysplasia and congenital anomalies, such as patches of depigmented hairs and limb defects.

Conclusions: Cleft lip has been documented in several species of nonhuman primates, but much remains unknown about the occurrence of cleft lip and cleft palate in great apes, probably because such malformations are rare, wild apes are difficult to monitor and observe, and severe cases associated with cleft palates render suckling impossible and lead to early death of infants. The genetic basis of such defects in great apes warrants investigation, as does the possibility that environmental toxins contribute to their etiology in Kibale in ways that could affect humans as well."
Skeletal development of hallucal tarsometatarsal joint curvature and angulation in extant apes and modern humans,"['Gill, CM', 'Bredella, MA', 'DeSilva, JM', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.07.003,NOV 2015,0,"The medial cuneiform, namely the curvature and angulation of its distal facet with metatarsal 1, is crucial as a stabilizer in bipedal locomotion and an axis upon which the great toe medially deviates during arboreal locomotion in extant apes. Previous work has shown that facet curvature and angulation in adult dry-bone specimens can distinguish African apes from Homo, and can even distinguish among species of Gorilla. This study provides the first ontogenetic assessment of medial cuneiform curvature and angulation in juvenile (n = 68) and adult specimens (n = 102) using computed tomography in humans and extant ape specimens, including Pongo. Our data find that modern human juveniles initially have a convex and slightly medially oriented osseous surface of the developing medial cuneiform distal facet that flattens and becomes more distally oriented with age. The same pattern (though of a different magnitude) occurs developmentally in the chimpanzee medial cuneiform, but not in Gorilla or Pongo, whose medial cuneiform facet angulation remains unchanged ontogenetically. These data suggest that the medial cuneiform ossifies in a distinguishable pattern between Pongo, Gorilla, Pan, and Homo, which may in part be due to subtle differences in the loading environment at the hallucal tarsometatarsal joint a finding that has important implications for interpreting fossil medial cuneiforms.

Beating Their Chests: University Students With ADHD Demonstrate Greater Attentional Abilities on an Inattentional Blindness Paradigm,"['Grossman, ES', 'Hoffman, YSG', 'Berger, I', 'Zivotofsky, AZ']",NEUROPSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/neu0000189,NOV 2015,0,"Objective: Adults diagnosed with attentional deficit disorder (ADHD) are easily distracted in many tasks. Yet ADHD performance on inattentional blindness (IB) tasks has not been examined. Such investigation may aid in discriminating between 3 ADHD models: the neurological model, the perceptual load theory, and the ""hunter versus farmer"" hypothesis. Method: Distractibility was assessed in ADHD and non-ADHD college students using the MOXO task that involves detection of a single attended stimulus that repeatedly appears in the same place and in the well-known IB ""gorilla"" video which involves tracking of a stimulus moving at a fast pace in a dynamic, complex manner. Results: ADHD college students showed increased distractibility in the MOXO task. By contrast, they performed better than controls in the attended channel of the IB task, while they were also better at noticing the unattended stimuli and thus exhibiting little-to-no inattentional blindness. Conclusions: As no attentional tradeoffs were evident in the IB task, it appears that the results are most consistent with the ""hunter versus farmer"" hypothesis, which postulates that ADHD individuals have an alternative cognitive style which is less equipped to deal with detection of repeated stimuli while comprising advantages in the tracking of stimuli moving in a fast dynamic manner."
Choice and control for animals in captivity,"['Kurtycz, LM']",PSYCHOLOGIST,NA,NOV 2015,0,"Today, by reading this sentence, you made a choice about what to do with your time. In fact, every day you make dozens of choices that you may not even realise you are making - what to do, when to eat, where to go, with whom to spend time ... the possibilities are nearly endless. However, when we lack control over our actions, we can suffer from 'learned helplessness' and we may stop trying to make choices altogether. The same is true for animals living in captivity.

For some animals this can lead to serious negative consequences evidenced behaviourally and physiologically. Could providing choices to captive animals alleviate the symptoms associated with a Lack of control and improve welfare? And what might it be able to tell us about their cognition and decision making?"
Being a victim or an aggressor: Different functions of triadic post-conflict interactions in wolves (Canis lupus lupus),"['Cordoni, G', 'Palagi, E']",AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR,10.1002/ab.21590,NOV-DEC 2015,0,"Animals adopt different behavioral strategies to cope with the conflict of interests coming from the competition over limited resources. Starting from the study on chimpanzees, post-conflict third-party affiliation (the affiliative contact provided by a third-party toward the victimVTAor the aggressorATA) was investigated mainly in primates. Later, this post-conflict mechanism has been demonstrated also in other mammals, such as wallabies, horses, dolphins, domestic dogs, and wolves. Here, we present data on triadic post-conflict affiliation in wolves (Canis lupus lupus) by exploring some of the hypotheses already proposed for primates and never tested before in other social mammals. In this carnivore species, the study of VTA and ATA revealed that these strategies cannot be considered as a unique behavioral category since they differ in many functional aspects. VTA serves to protect the victim by reducing the likelihood of reiterated attacks from the previous aggressor and to reinforce the relationship shared by the third-party and the victim. On the other hand, ATA has a role in bystander protection by limiting the renewed attacks of the previous aggressor toward uninvolved group-members (potential third-parties). In conclusion, exploring VTA and ATA gives the opportunity to concurrently demonstrate some functional differences in triadic post-conflict affiliation according to the different targets of bystanders (victims or aggressors). The data comparison between primates and other social mammals should permit to open new lines of research. Aggr. Behav. 41:526-536, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Cross-sectional structural variation relative to midshaft along hominine diaphyses. I. The forelimb,"['Mongle, CS', 'Wallace, IJ', 'Grine, FE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22799,NOV 2015,0,"ObjectivesAnalyses of hominine forelimb diaphyseal structure typically employ sections located at midshaft. This study addresses three questions. First, how accurately must midshaft be defined to yield comparable data? Second, does variation in midshaft location due to alternative definitions fall within error ranges such that data gathered using different length measurements are comparable? Third, do error ranges and length metric effects differ between elements or taxa such that certain bones or species are more prone to issues of comparability?

Materials and MethodsHumeri, radii, and ulnae of Homo, Pan, and Gorilla were CT-scanned at full length and error ranges for three structural parameters (CSA, J, I-max/I-min) were calculated around midshafts.

ResultsDistances proximally and distally from midshaft where structural values become significantly different from midshaft values vary between elements, taxa, and structural parameters. Error ranges are largest for the humerus and smallest for the ulna. Among taxa, error ranges for gorillas are largest and those for humans are smallest. Among structural parameters, error ranges depend on element and taxon such that no parameter consistently exhibits larger or smaller error ranges across all bones or species. Variation in midshaft locations originating from different length definitions is small and falls within error ranges defined by maximum length across all elements and taxa.

DiscussionIncluding fragmentary specimens for which midshaft location is uncertain in comparisons of forelimb diaphyseal structure requires evaluation on a case-by-case basis, with consideration to element, taxon, and structural traits of interest.

Here, we address three questions. First, how accurately must midshaft be defined to yield comparable data? Second, does variation in midshaft location due to different ways of measuring length fall within error ranges such that data gathered using different metrics are comparable? Third, do error ranges and length metric effects differ between elements or taxa such that certain bones or species are more prone to issues of comparability?

Materials and MethodsFemora and tibiae of Homo, Pan, and Gorilla were CT-scanned longitudinally and error ranges for multiple structural parameters (CSA, J, I-max/I-min) were calculated around midshafts.

ResultsDistances proximally and distally from midshaft where structural values differ significantly from midshaft values vary between bones, species, and structural traits. Femoral error ranges are typically larger than tibial ranges. In the femur, error ranges are generally largest for chimpanzees and smallest for gorillas. A similar taxonomic pattern is not evident in the tibia. No structural trait consistently displays larger or smaller error ranges across both elements and all species. Variation in midshaft locations stemming from different length definitions is small and falls within observed error ranges defined by any one metric.

Integration between the face and the mandible of Pongo and the evolution of the craniofacial morphology of orangutans,"['Neaux, D', 'Gilissen, E', 'Coudyzer, W', 'Guy, F']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22807,NOV 2015,0,"ObjectivesExtant Pongo diverges from other hominids by a series of craniofacial morphological features, such as a concave face, a reduced supraorbital torus, or an upwardly orientated palate. These traits are not independent because the skull is a complex integrated structure. The aim of this study is to describe the relationship between the face and mandible of Pongo, in order to examine the link between mandibular structures and the set-up of the unique facial features of orangutans.

Materials and methodsUsing 3D geometric morphometrics, the morphological integration between face and mandible of Pongo is compared to that of the three extant hominids: Homo, Pan, and Gorilla. Pooled within-species partial least squares analyses are computed in order to quantify the patterns and levels of integration.

ResultsThe covariation analyses show unique patterns of integration and levels of correlation in Pongo when compared to other hominids. This study shows that the craniofacial features distinguishing Pongo from African great apes are related to differences in the patterns of integration and levels of correlation between facial and mandibular shape.

DiscussionChanges in important functions may play a part in these modifications of craniofacial integration.

Energetic responses to variation in food availability in the two mountain gorilla populations (Gorilla beringei beringei),"['Wright, E', 'Grueter, CC', 'Seiler, N', 'Abavandimwe, D', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Ortmann, S', 'Robbins, MM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22808,NOV 2015,1,"ObjectiveHere, we compare food availability and relate this to differences in energy intake rates, time spent feeding, and daily travel distance of gorillas in the two populations.

Comparative intraspecific studies investigating spatiotemporal variation in food availability can help us understand the complex relationships between ecology, behavior, and life history in primates and are relevant to understanding hominin evolution. Differences in several variables have been documented between the two mountain gorilla populations in the Virunga Massif and Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, but few direct comparisons that link ecological conditions to feeding behavior have been made.

Materials and MethodsUsing similar data collection protocols we conducted vegetation sampling and nutritional analysis on important foods to estimate food availability. Detailed observations of feeding behavior were used to compute energy intake rates and daily travel distance was estimated through GPS readings.

ResultsFood availability was overall lower and had greater temporal variability in Bwindi than in the Virungas. Energy intake rates and time spent feeding were similar in both populations, but energy intake rates were significantly higher in Bwindi during the period of high fruit consumption. Daily travel distances were significantly shorter in the Virungas.

ConclusionsOverall, despite the differences in food availability, we did not find large differences in the energetics of gorillas in the two populations, although further work is needed to more precisely quantify energy expenditure and energy balance. These results emphasize that even species with high food availability can exhibit behavioral and energetic responses to variable ecological conditions, which are likely to affect growth, reproduction, and survival.

The adaptive value of secondary males in the polygynous multi-level society of hamadryas baboons,"['Chowdhury, S', 'Pines, M', 'Saunders, J', 'Swedell, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22804,NOV 2015,1,"ObjectivesOne-male social systems are usually characterized by polygyny and reproductive exclusion by a single resident male. Sometimes, however, secondary males join these groups, and this may carry fitness costs and/or benefits to the resident male. In hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas hamadryas), which live in one-male units (OMUs) with female defense polygyny within a multi-level social system, secondary follower males often reside in OMUs. Our aim here is to examine possible benefits of these secondary males to hamadryas resident males.

Materials and MethodsUsing 6 years of data from 65 OMUs in a band of wild hamadryas baboons in Ethiopia, we compared demographic and reproductive parameters of OMUs with and without secondary follower males to assess whether their presence conferred any reproductive benefits to resident leader males.

ResultsLeaders with followers had tenure lengths almost twice as long, acquired more than twice as many females, retained females longer, and had three times as many infants during their tenure compared to leaders without followers.

DiscussionHamadryas follower males enabled leaders to retain females for longer periods of timelikely through unit defense, social relationships with OMU members, and/or infant protection. Hamadryas leaders appear to be able to monopolize access to females despite the presence of followers, and as such any enhanced reproduction derived from the presence of followers likely increases the fitness of the leader rather than the follower. Thus the relationship between leaders and followers in hamadryas society appears to be a mutually beneficial one and tolerance of secondary males may be an adaptive reproductive strategy characterizing hamadryas leader males.

This study explored the exon 2 variation of -DPB1, -DQB1, and -DRB genes in 46 gorillas from four populations while simultaneously evaluating the feasibility of using fecal samples for high-throughput MHC genotyping. By applying strict similarity-and frequency-based analysis, we found, despite our modest sample size, a total of 18 alleles that have not been described previously, thereby illustrating the potential for efficient and highly accurate MHC genotyping from non-invasive DNA samples. We emphasize the importance of controlling for multiple potential sources of error when applying this massively parallel short-read sequencing technology to PCR products generated from low concentration DNA extracts. We observed pronounced differences in MHC variation between species, subspecies and populations that are consistent with both the ancient and recent demographic histories experienced by gorillas.

Comparing humans and nonhuman great apes in the broken cloth problem: Is their knowledge causal or perceptual?,"['Albiach-Serrano, A', 'Sebastian-Enesco, C', 'Seed, A', 'Colmenares, F', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY,10.1016/j.jecp.2015.06.004,NOV 2015,0,"When presented with the broken cloth problem, both human children and nonhuman great apes prefer to pull a continuous cloth over a discontinuous cloth in order to obtain a desired object resting on top. This has been interpreted as evidence that they preferentially attend to the functionally relevant cues of the task (e.g., presence or absence of a gap along the cloth). However, there is controversy regarding whether great apes' behavior is underpinned by causal knowledge, involving abstract concepts (e.g., support, connection), or by perceptual knowledge, based on percepts (e.g., contact, continuity). We presented chimpanzees, orangutans, and 2-, 3-, and 4-year-old children with two versions of the broken cloth problem. The Real condition, made with paper strips, could be solved based on either perceptual cues or causal knowledge. The Painted condition, which looked very similar, could be solved only by attending to perceptual cues. All groups mastered the Real condition, in line with previous results. Older children (3- and 4-year-olds) performed significantly better in this condition than all other groups, but the performance of apes and children did not differ sharply, with 2-year-olds and apes obtaining similar results. In contrast, only 4-year-olds solved the Painted condition. We propose causal knowledge to explain the general good performance of apes and humans in the Real condition compared with the Painted condition. In addition, we suggest that symbolic knowledge might account for 4-year-olds' performance in the Painted condition. Our findings add to the growing literature supporting the idea that learning from arbitrary cues is not a good explanation for the performance of apes and humans on some kinds of physical task.

Accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm with interpair pruning and band optimization for the all-pairs comparison of base sequences,"['Okada, D', 'Ino, F', 'Hagihara, K']",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,10.1186/s12859-015-0744-4,OCT 6 2015,0,"Background: The Smith-Waterman algorithm is known to be a more sensitive approach than heuristic algorithms for local sequence alignment algorithms. Despite its sensitivity, a greater time complexity associated with the Smith-Waterman algorithm prevents its application to the all-pairs comparisons of base sequences, which aids in the construction of accurate phylogenetic trees. The aim of this study is to achieve greater acceleration using the Smith-Waterman algorithm (by realizing interpair block pruning and band optimization) compared with that achieved using a previous method that performs intrapair block pruning on graphics processing units (GPUs).

Results: We present an interpair optimization method for the Smith-Waterman algorithm with the aim of accelerating the all-pairs comparison of base sequences. Given the results of the pairs of sequences, our method realizes efficient block pruning by computing a lower bound for other pairs that have not yet been processed. This lower bound is further used for band optimization. We integrated our interpair optimization method into SW#, a previous GPU-based implementation that employs variants of a banded Smith-Waterman algorithm and a banded Myers-Miller algorithm. Evaluation using the six genomes of Bacillus anthracis shows that our method pruned 88 % of the matrix cells on a single GPU and 73 % of the matrix cells on two GPUs. For the genomes of the human chromosome 21, the alignment performance reached 202 giga-cell updates per second (GCUPS) on two Tesla K40 GPUs.

Conclusions: Efficient interpair pruning and band optimization makes it possible to complete the all-pairs comparisons of the sequences of the same species 1.2 times faster than the intrapair pruning method. This acceleration was achieved at the first phase of SW#, where our method significantly improved the initial lower bound. However, our interpair optimization was not effective for the comparison of the sequences of different species such as comparing human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. Consequently, our method is useful in accelerating the applications that require optimal local alignments scores for the same species.

A Case Study,"['Collins, CK', 'Marples, NM']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,10.1080/10888705.2015.1034278,OCT 2 2015,0,"There is increasing evidence that in some circumstances, zoo visitors may be aversive stimuli to nonhuman animals housed in zoos. Yet, most previous research has focused on primates with little attention given to numerous other species who are housed in zoos. The focus animal of this project was the cockatoo, a species who has received minimal attention in zoo-based research. Furthermore, although the influence of the zoo setting has become increasingly important in visitor effect studies, this is the 1st study to quantify the effect of activity at a children's playground on zoo animals. There was an investigation on the effect of a zoo playground on the behavior of citron-crested and Moluccan cockatoos (Cacatua sulphurea citrinocristata and Cacatua moluccensis), as well as the effect of children standing in front of the birds' aviaries. The results showed that in some circumstances, the Moluccan cockatoos retreated from visitors, while the citron-crested cockatoos did not retreat from visitors and became more social in the presence of visitors. These findings highlight the importance of careful selection of species and individual animals to be housed near zoo playgrounds."
Social Learning Opportunities in Captive Orangutans (Pongo abelii) and Mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx),"['Bebko, AO', 'Russon, AE']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-015-9870-0,OCT 2015,0,"Social learning is important in the acquisition of many primate behaviors, including food acquisition, object use, and sociality. Social learning opportunities are social situations in which social learning could occur and provide a means of studying influences on social learning in observational research. Species-specific characteristics and individual relationships may influence the importance of social learning opportunities for some behaviors over others. We observed eight captive orangutans (Pongo abelii) and five mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) for > 60 h each at the Toronto Zoo to assess intra- and interspecies differences in social learning opportunities. We measured social learning opportunity quality using spatial proximity because this has been associated with high-quality social learning. Both species had similar captive diets and group structure; therefore observed differences were likely due to species and individual differences, rather than captive environment. We found species differences in the frequency of social learning opportunities, their quality, and the associated type of behavior (food vs. social behavior). Orangutans had more high-quality social learning opportunities relating to food behavior than mandrills, and mandrills had more high-quality social learning opportunities relating to social behavior than orangutans. Both species had more high-quality social learning opportunities in mother-infant vs. other dyads. Our results suggest that learning about food behavior may be more important for orangutans and learning about social behavior may be more important for mandrills. Overall, our results suggest that social learning may be constrained/fostered by differences in frequency and quality of social learning opportunities between species and individuals."
A tsetse and tabanid fly survey of African great apes habitats reveals the presence of a novel trypanosome lineage but the absence of Trypanosoma brucei,"['Votypka, J', 'Radrova, J', 'Skalicky, T', 'Jirku, M', 'Jirsova, D', 'Mihalca, AD', ""D'Amico, G"", 'Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Modry, D', 'Lukes, J']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/j.ijpara.2015.06.005,OCT 2015,1,"Tsetse and tabanid flies transmit several Trypanosoma species, some of which are human and livestock pathogens of major medical and socioeconomic impact in Africa. Recent advances in molecular techniques and phylogenetic analyses have revealed a growing diversity of previously unidentified tsetse-transmitted trypanosomes potentially pathogenic to livestock and/or other domestic animals as well as wildlife, including African great apes. To map the distribution, prevalence and co-occurrence of known and novel trypanosome species, we analyzed tsetse and tabanid flies collected in the primary forested part of the Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic, which hosts a broad spectrum of wildlife including primates and is virtually devoid of domestic animals. Altogether, 564 tsetse flies and 81 tabanid flies were individually screened for the presence of trypanosomes using 18S rRNA-specific nested PCR. Herein, we demonstrate that wildlife animals are parasitized by a surprisingly wide range of trypanosome species that in some cases may circulate via these insect vectors. While one-third of the examined tsetse flies harbored trypanosomes either from the Trypanosoma theileri, Trypanosoma congolense or Trypanosoma simiae complex, or one of the three new members of the genus Trypanosoma (strains 'Bai', 'Ngbanda' and 'Didon'), more than half of the tabanid flies exclusively carried T. theileri. To establish the putative vertebrate hosts of the novel trypanosome species, we further analyzed the provenance of blood meals of tsetse flies. DNA individually isolated from 1033 specimens of Glossina spp. and subjected to high-throughput library-based screening proved that most of the examined tsetse flies engorged on wild ruminants (buffalo, sitatunga, bongo), humans and suids. Moreover, they also fed (albeit more rarely) on other vertebrates, thus providing indirect but convincing evidence that trypanosomes can be transmitted via these vectors among a wide range of warm- and cold-blooded hosts.

Decaying toxic wood as sodium supplement for herbivorous mammals in Gabon,"['Iwata, Y', 'Nakashima, Y', 'Tsuchida, S', 'Nguema, PPM', 'Ando, C', 'Ushida, K', 'Yamagiwa, J']",JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL SCIENCE,10.1292/jvms.15-0111,OCT 2015,0,"African rainforest harbors herbivores at high density. However, because plants and soils typically lack in some essential minerals, rainforest is not always a suitable habitat for herbivores. How they fulfill the mineral requirements is therefore an important question to animal ecology and conservation. Although large marshes, called 'bais', are often mentioned as efficient mineral-resource, little information on other sodium resources has still been available. Our laboratory works and field surveys found that a peculiar item, decaying wood stumps of Anthostema aubiyanum, played as a major sodium resource for herbivores in Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon. When A. aubryanum is alive, the sodium content of its bark is low and its latex is toxic. Sodium is accumulated in decaying stumps (mean=1,343 mg/kg dry matter). Eight herbivores visited stumps to ingest the dead wood. Fecal sample analysis revealed that western lowland gorillas, a species most-frequently using the stumps, consumed large amount of the dead wood as regular food. Our findings suggest that decaying A. aubryanum is critical sodium-resources and is a key species for herbivores in our study area. Importance of the A. aubryanum may be particularly large there, because it is a limited sodium-rich material that is available year round. Our study site is known as the site where the densities of several herbivores are among the highest at Central Africa. The relatively high herbivores density in our study site may partly depend on decaying A. aubryanum as sodium resources."
Hey! What's that Gorilla Doing over There? On the Illusory-Hallucinatory Nature of Everyday Living,"['Marsh, MN', 'AUTOSCOPIC PHENOMENA']",EUROPEAN REVIEW,10.1017/S1062798715000289,OCT 2015,0,"Our experiences, through day and night, are not as clear-cut as might seem on first thought. Considerable aspects of life comprise illusory phenomena, some of which are realised, while others are not. Moreover, the boundaries between illusion and hallucination can be very blurred. This essay considers specific situations exemplary of these aberrations - the phantom limb phenomenon, the effects of migraine and temporal lobe epilepsy, sleep disturbances, out-of-body and near-death experiences, conjuring, and the technique of pick-pocketing. Life is never as certain or as sure as we think."
Phylogenomic evidence for recombination of adenoviruses in wild gorillas,"['Hoppe, E', 'Pauly, M', 'Robbins, M', 'Gray, M', 'Kujirakwinja, D', 'Nishuli, R', 'Mungu-Akonkwa, DDB', 'Leendertz, FH', 'Ehlers, B']",JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY,10.1099/jgv.0.000250,SEP 2015,0,"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) of species Human mastadenovirus B (HAdV-B) are genetically highly diverse and comprise several pathogenic types. AdVs closely related to members of HAdV-B infect African great apes and the evolutionary origin of HAdV-B has recently been determined in ancient gorillas. Genetic evidence for intra- and inter-species recombination has been obtained for Ad Vs of humans and captive great apes, but evidence from wild great apes is lacking. In this study, potential HAdV-B members of wild Eastern gorillas were analysed for evidence of recombination. One near-complete genome was amplified from primary sample material and sequenced, and from another six individuals genome fragments were obtained. In phylogenomic analysis, their penton base, pVII-pVI, hexon and fiber genes were compared with those of all publicly available HAdV-B full-genome sequences of humans and captive great apes. Evidence for intra-species recombination between different HAdV-B members of wild gorillas as well as between HAdV-B members of chimpanzees and gorillas was obtained. Since zoonotic Ad Vs have been reported. to cause respiratory outbreaks in both humans and monkeys, and humans in West and Central Africa frequently hunt and butcher primates thereby increasing the chance of zoonotic transmission, such HAdV-B recombinants might widen the pool of potential human pathogens."
Screening Wild and Semi-Free Ranging Great Apes for Putative Sexually Transmitted Diseases: Evidence of Trichomonadidae Infections,"['Rushmore, J', 'Allison, AB', 'Edwards, EE', 'Bagal, U', 'Altizer, S', 'Cranfield, MR', 'Glenn, TC', 'Liu, H', 'Mudakikwa, A', 'Mugisha, L', 'Muller, MN', 'Stumpf, RM', 'Thompson, ME', 'Wrangham, R', 'Yabsley, MJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22442,OCT 2015,0,"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can persist endemically, are known to cause sterility and infant mortality in humans, and could have similar impacts in wildlife populations. African apes (i.e., chimpanzees, bonobos, and to a lesser extent gorillas) show multi-male mating behavior that could offer opportunities for STD transmission, yet little is known about the prevalence and impact of STDs in this endangered primate group. We used serology and PCR-based detection methods to screen biological samples from wild and orphaned eastern chimpanzees and gorillas (N = 172 individuals, including adults, and juveniles) for four classes of pathogens that either commonly cause human STDs or were previously detected in captive apes: trichomonads, Chlamydia spp., Treponema pallidum (syphilis and yaws), and papillomaviruses. Based on results from prior modeling and comparative research, we expected STD prevalence to be highest in females versus males and in sexually mature versus immature individuals. All samples were negative for Chlamydia, Treponema pallidum, and papillomaviruses; however, a high percentage of wild chimpanzee urine and fecal samples showed evidence of trichomonads (protozoa). Analysis revealed that females were more likely than males to have positive urine-but not fecal-samples; however, there was no evidence of age (sexual maturity) differences in infection status. Sequence analysis of chimpanzee trichomonad samples revealed a close relationship to previously described trichomonads within the genus Tetratrichomonas. Phylogenetic comparisons to archived sequences from multiple vertebrate hosts suggests that many of the chimpanzee parasites from our study are likely transmitted via fecal-oral contact, but the transmission of some Tetratrichomonas sequence-types remains unknown and could include sexual contact. Our work emphasizes that only a fraction of infectious agents affecting wild apes are presently known to science, and that further work on great ape STDs could offer insights for the management of endangered great apes and for understanding human STD origins.

Locating Chimpanzee Nests and Identifying Fruiting Trees With an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"['Van Andel, AC', 'Wich, SA', 'Boesch, C', 'Koh, LP', 'Robbins, MM', 'Kelly, J', 'Kuehl, HS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22446,OCT 2015,0,"Monitoring of animal populations is essential for conservation management. Various techniques are available to assess spatiotemporal patterns of species distribution and abundance. Nest surveys are often used for monitoring great apes. Quickly developing technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to complement these ground-based surveys, especially for covering large areas rapidly. Aerial surveys have been used successfully to detect the nests of orang-utans. It is unknown if such an approach is practical for African apes, which usually build their nests at lower heights, where they might be obscured by forest canopy. In this 2-month study, UAV-derived aerial imagery was used for two distinct purposes: testing the detectability of chimpanzee nests and identifying fruiting trees used by chimpanzees in Loango National Park (Gabon). Chimpanzee nest data were collected through two approaches: we located nests on the ground and then tried to detect them in UAV photos and vice versa. Ground surveys were conducted using line transects, reconnaissance trails, and opportunistic sampling during which we detected 116 individual nests in 28 nest groups. In complementary UAV images we detected 48% of the individual nests (68% of nest groups) in open coastal forests and 8% of individual nests (33% of nest groups) in closed canopy inland forests. The key factor for nest detectability in UAV imagery was canopy openness. Data on fruiting trees were collected from five line transects. In 122 UAV images 14 species of trees (N = 433) were identified, alongside 37 tree species (N = 205) in complementary ground surveys. Relative abundance of common tree species correlated between ground and UAV surveys. We conclude that UAVs have great potential as a rapid assessment tool for detecting chimpanzee presence in forest with open canopy and assessing fruit tree availability. UAVs may have limited applicability for nest detection in closed canopy forest. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Mirror self-recognition: a review and critique of attempts to promote and engineer self-recognition in primates,"['Anderson, JR', 'Gallup, GG']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-015-0488-9,OCT 2015,1,"We review research on reactions to mirrors and self-recognition in nonhuman primates, focusing on methodological issues. Starting with the initial demonstration in chimpanzees in 1970 and subsequent attempts to extend this to other species, self-recognition in great apes is discussed with emphasis on spontaneous manifestations of mirror-guided self-exploration as well as spontaneous use of the mirror to investigate foreign marks on otherwise nonvisible body parts-the mark test. Attempts to show self-recognition in other primates are examined with particular reference to the lack of convincing examples of spontaneous mirror-guided self-exploration, and efforts to engineer positive mark test responses by modifying the test or using conditioning techniques. Despite intensive efforts to demonstrate self-recognition in other primates, we conclude that to date there is no compelling evidence that prosimians, monkeys, or lesser apes-gibbons and siamangs-are capable of mirror self-recognition."
"Bonobo habituation in a forest-savanna mosaic habitat: influence of ape species, habitat type, and sociocultural context","['Narat, V', 'Pennec, F', 'Simmen, B', 'Ngawolo, JCB', 'Krief, S']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-015-0476-0,OCT 2015,1,"Habituation is the term used to describe acceptance by wild animals of a human observer as a neutral element in their environment. Among primates, the process takes from a few days for Galago spp. to several years for African apes. There are also intraspecies differences reflecting differences in habitat, home range, and ape-human relationship history. Here, we present the first study of the process of bonobo habituation in a fragmented habitat, a forest-savanna mosaic in the community-based conservation area led by the Congolese nongovernmental organization Mbou-Mon-Tour, Democratic Republic of the Congo. In this area, local people use the forest almost every day for traditional activities but avoid bonobos because of a traditional taboo. Because very few flight reactions were observed during habituation, we focused on quantitative parameters to assess the development of ape tolerance and of the tracking efficiency of observer teams. During the 18-month study period (May 2012-October 2013), 4043 h (319 days) were spent in the forest and bonobos were observed for a total of 405 h (196 contacts on 134 days). The average contact duration was stable over time (124 min), but the minimal distance during a contact decreased with habituation effort. Moreover, bonobo location and tracking efficiency, daily ratio of contact time to habituation effort, and the number of observations at ground level were positively correlated with habituation effort. Our observations suggest that bonobos become habituated relatively rapidly. These results are discussed in relation to the habitat type, ape species, and the local sociocultural context of villagers. The habituation process involves changes in ape behavior toward observers and also more complex interactions concerning the ecosystem, including the building of an efficient local team. Before starting a habituation process, knowledge of the human sociocultural context is essential to assess the balance between risks and benefits."
Evolutionary Characterization of the Retinitis Pigmentosa GTPase Regulator Gene,"['Raghupathy, RK', 'Gautier, P', 'Soares, DC', 'Wright, AF', 'Shu, XH']",INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE,10.1167/iovs.15-17726,OCT 2015,0,"PURPOSE. The evolutionary conservation of the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) gene was examined across vertebrate and invertebrate lineages to elucidate its function.

METHODS. Orthologous RPGR sequences from vertebrates and invertebrates were selected. Multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic analyses, synteny, and gene structure comparisons were carried out. Expression of the alternatively spliced constitutive (RPGR(const) or RPGR(ex1-19)) and RPGR(ORF15) isoforms was examined in developing and adult zebrafish.

RESULTS. Phylogenetic analyses and syntenic relationships were consistent with the selected sequences being true orthologues, although whole genome duplications in teleost fish resulted in a more complex picture. The splice form RPGR(const) was present in all vertebrate and invertebrate species but the defining carboxyl (C)-terminal exon of RPGR(ORF15) was absent from all invertebrates. The regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1)-like domain adopts a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, which was present in both major splice forms and strongly conserved across evolution. The repetitive acidic region of RPGR(ORF15) showed a high rate of in-frame deletions/insertions across nine primate species, compared with flanking sequences, consistent with an unstable and rapidly evolving region. In zebrafish, RPGR(const) transcripts were most strongly expressed in early development, while the RPGR(ORF15) isoform showed highest expression in adult eye.

CONCLUSIONS. The regulator of chromosome condensation 1-like domain of RPGR was conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates, but RPGR(ORF15) was unique to vertebrates, consistent with a proposed role in the ciliary-based transport of cargoes such as rhodopsin, which is similar to 10 times more abundant in vertebrate than invertebrate photoreceptors. The repetitive acidic region of RPGR(ORF15) shows a rapid rate of evolution, consistent with a mutation ""hot spot."""
Premolar root and canal variation in extant non-human hominoidea,"['Moore, NC', 'Hublin, JJ', 'Skinner, MM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22776,OCT 2015,0,"ObjectivesThe premolar sub-cervical region in four non-human extant ape genera are examined to: 1) define a classification scheme for the premolar root system in order to rigorously characterize, quantify and document variation in root and canal, form, number and configuration; 2) compare this variation within and between genera; and 3) test the hypotheses that sex and size (i.e., the size/number continuum, Shields, ) of the premolar are determinants of root/canal form and/or number.

Materials and MethodsMicrotomography and 3D visualization software are utilized to examine a large sample of Hylobates, Pan, Gorilla, and Pongo (n=951 teeth). Each premolar root system is examined to ascertain the expected level of variability for each taxon. Cervical surface area (mm(2)) serves as a metric proxy for tooth size. A Chi-square test of independence is used to assess for variability differences between and within each taxon, and Mann-Whitney U tests are employed to assess the predicted relationship between tooth size and variation within each taxon.

ResultsOur findings indicate that root and canal configurations, non-metric root traits and tooth size can distinguish between extant ape genera. Within the four ape taxa, premolar size variation is generally, but not always, correlated with canal/root number. Our results indicate that males and females within genera differ in tooth size but not in canal/root form and number.

DiscussionWe report previously undocumented variation in the study taxa. Our results are discussed within the context of Miocene Apes as well as the developmental and systematic implications. Am J Phys Anthropol 158:209-226, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Clavicular curvature and locomotion in anthropoid primates: A 3D geometric morphometric analysis,"['Squyres, N', 'DeLeon, VB']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22785,OCT 2015,0,"Objectives:As a component of the primate shoulder, the clavicle is expected to reflect locomotor adaptations. Whereas previous work has generally focused on clavicular length and torsion, the shape of clavicular curvature may better distinguish taxa and provide additional information about upper limb use in locomotion. This study uses three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to analyze shape differences in the curvatures of the clavicle in different locomotor groups of anthropoid primates.

Methods:Sliding semi-landmarks were placed on clavicles of 10 Anthropoid primate species (total n=85) that display a range of locomotor behaviors. Landmarks (k=39) were chosen to capture the overall curvature of the clavicle in three dimensions.

Results:The degree of ventral curvature in the clavicle represents a gradient from most-curved in suspensory genera (e.g., Ateles, Hylobates, and Pongo) to least-curved in genera that are rarely suspensory (e.g., Papio and Gorilla). This curvature may allow an increased range of craniodorsal movement without the clavicle impinging on the thoracic outlet. An inferior curvature of the medial clavicle is found in hominoids and brachiators. This curvature could help stabilize the shoulder and prevent superior dislocation of the clavicle in suspension. Finally, a superior curvature in the lateral part of the clavicle, most pronounced in quadrupedal monkeys, may be related to the relative position of the scapula and sternum.

Conclusions:Patterns of clavicular curvature in anthropoid primates reflect locomotor behavior and successfully distinguished among taxonomic and locomotor groups. In the future, this method could be used to assess locomotor behavior in fossil primates. Am J Phys Anthropol 158:257-268, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
The interplay between DNA methylation and sequence divergence in recent human evolution,"['Hernando-Herraez, I', 'Heyn, H', 'Fernandez-Callejo, M', 'Vidal, E', 'Fernandez-Bellon, H', 'Prado-Martinez, J', 'Sharp, AJ', 'Esteller, M', 'Marques-Bonet, T']",NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH,10.1093/nar/gkv693,SEP 30 2015,0,"Despite the increasing knowledge about DNA methylation, the understanding of human epigenome evolution is in its infancy. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing we identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in humans compared to non-human primates and estimated that similar to 25% of these regions were detectable throughout several human tissues. Human DMRs were enriched for specific histone modifications and the majority were located distal to transcription start sites, highlighting the importance of regions outside the direct regulatory context. We also found a significant excess of endogenous retrovirus elements in human-specific hypomethylated.

We reported for the first time a close interplay between inter-species genetic and epigenetic variation in regions of incomplete lineage sorting, transcription factor binding sites and human differentially hypermethylated regions. Specifically, we observed an excess of human-specific substitutions in transcription factor binding sites located within human DMRs, suggesting that alteration of regulatory motifs underlies some human-specific methylation patterns. We also found that the acquisition of DNA hypermethylation in the human lineage is frequently coupled with a rapid evolution at nucleotide level in the neighborhood of these CpG sites. Taken together, our results reveal new insights into the mechanistic basis of human-specific DNA methylation patterns and the interpretation of inter-species non-coding variation."
Grandmothering life histories and human pair bonding,"['Coxworth, JE', 'Kim, PS', 'McQueen, JS', 'Hawkes, K']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1599993112,SEP 22 2015,1,"The evolution of distinctively human life history and social organization is generally attributed to paternal provisioning based on pair bonds. Here we develop an alternative argument that connects the evolution of human pair bonds to the male-biased mating sex ratios that accompanied the evolution of human life history. We simulate an agent-based model of the grandmother hypothesis, compare simulated sex ratios to data on great apes and human hunter-gatherers, and note associations between a preponderance of males and mate guarding across taxa. Then we explore a recent model that highlights the importance of mating sex ratios for differences between birds and mammals and conclude that lessons for human evolution cannot ignore mammalian reproductive constraints. In contradiction to our claim that male-biased sex ratios are characteristically human, female-biased ratios are reported in some populations. We consider the likelihood that fertile men are undercounted and conclude that the mate-guarding hypothesis for human pair bonds gains strength from explicit links with our grandmothering life history."
Organization and evolution of Gorilla centromeric DNA from old strategies to new approaches,"['Catacchio, CR', 'Ragone, R', 'Chiatante, G', 'Ventura, M']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,10.1038/srep14189,SEP 21 2015,0,"The centromere/kinetochore interaction is responsible for the pairing and segregation of replicated chromosomes in eukaryotes. Centromere DNA is portrayed as scarcely conserved, repetitive in nature, quickly evolving and protein-binding competent. Among primates, the major class of centromeric DNA is the pancentromeric alpha-satellite, made of arrays of 171 bp monomers, repeated in a head-to-tail pattern. alpha-satellite sequences can either form tandem heterogeneous monomeric arrays or assemble in higher-order repeats (HORs). Gorilla centromere DNA has barely been characterized, and data are mainly based on hybridizations of human alphoid sequences. We isolated and finely characterized gorilla alpha-satellite sequences and revealed relevant structure and chromosomal distribution similarities with other great apes as well as gorilla-specific features, such as the uniquely octameric structure of the suprachromosomal family-2 (SF2). We demonstrated for the first time the orthologous localization of alphoid suprachromosomal families-1 and - 2 (SF1 and SF2) between human and gorilla in contrast to chimpanzee centromeres. Finally, the discovery of a new 189 bp monomer type in gorilla centromeres unravels clues to the role of the centromere protein B, paving the way to solve the significance of the centromere DNA's essential repetitive nature in association with its function and the peculiar evolution of the alpha-satellite sequence."
