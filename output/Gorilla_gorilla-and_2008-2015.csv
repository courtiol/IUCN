From malaria parasite point of view - Plasmodium falciparum evolution,"['Zerka, A', 'Kaczmarek, R', 'Jaskiewicz, E']",POSTEPY HIGIENY I MEDYCYNY DOSWIADCZALNEJ,NA,DEC 31 2015,0,"Malaria is caused by infection with protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium, which have arguably exerted the greatest selection pressure on humans in the history of our species. Besides humans, different Plasmodium parasites infect a wide range of animal hosts, from marine invertebrates to primates. On the other hand, individual Plasmodium species show high host specificity. The extraordinary evolution of Plasmodium probably began when a free-living red algae turned parasitic, and culminated with its ability to thrive inside a human red blood cell. Studies on the African apes generated new data on the evolution of malaria parasites in general and the deadliest human-specific species, Plasmodium falciparum, in particular. Initially, it was hypothesized that P. falciparum descended from the chimpanzee malaria parasite P. reichenowi, after the human and the chimp lineage diverged about 6 million years ago. However, a recently identified new species infecting gorillas, unexpectedly showed similarity to P. falciparum and was therefore named P. praefalciparum. That finding spurred an alternative hypothesis, which proposes that P. falciparum descended from its gorilla rather than chimp counterpart. In addition, the gorilla-to-human host shift may have occurred more recently (about 10 thousand years ago) than the theoretical P. falciparum-P. reichenowi split.

One of the key aims of the studies on Plasmodium evolution is to elucidate the mechanisms that allow the incessant host shifting and retaining the host specificity, especially in the case of human-specific species. Thorough understanding of these phenomena will be necessary to design effective malaria treatment and prevention strategies."
Diversity of Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotypes among small rodents in southwestern Poland,"['Perec-Matysiak, A', 'Bunkowska-Gawlik, K', 'Kvac, M', 'Sak, B', 'Hildebrand, J', 'Lesnianska, K']",VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.10.018,DEC 15 2015,0,"Diversity of Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotypes in wild small rodent populations still remains incomplete and only few molecular studies have been conducted among these hosts. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether small rodents, i.e., Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus flavicollis, Mus musculus and Myodes glareolus act as hosts of E. bieneusi and can play an important role in spore spreading in the environment of south-western Poland. Molecular analyses were conducted to determine pathogen genotypes. A total of 191 fecal and 251 spleen samples collected from 311 rodent individuals were examined for the occurrence of E. bieneusi by PCR amplifying ITS gene. The overall prevalence of E. bieneusi in rodent samples was 38.9%. The nucleotide sequences of ITS region of E bieneusi revealed the presence a total of 12 genotypes with two being already known, i.e., D and gorilla 1 genotypes. The remaining ten are novel genotypes (WR1-WR10) which segregated into three groups in a neighbor joining phylogeny. This study reports for the first time E. bieneusi occurrence in wild living rodents in Poland and shows extensive genetic diversity within E. bieneusi isolates of rodent origin.

Results: Here the genome sequence of wild-born African cheetahs reveals extreme genomic depletion in SNV incidence, SNV density, SNVs of coding genes, MHC class I and II genes, and mitochondrial DNA SNVs. Cheetah genomes are on average 95 % homozygous compared to the genomes of the outbred domestic cat (24.08 % homozygous), Virunga Mountain Gorilla (78.12 %), inbred Abyssinian cat (62.63 %), Tasmanian devil, domestic dog and other mammalian species. Demographic estimators impute two ancestral population bottlenecks: one >100,000 years ago coincident with cheetah migrations out of the Americas and into Eurasia and Africa, and a second 11,084-12,589 years ago in Africa coincident with late Pleistocene large mammal extinctions. MHC class I gene loss and dramatic reduction in functional diversity of MHC genes would explain why cheetahs ablate skin graft rejection among unrelated individuals. Significant excess of non-synonymous mutations in AKAP4 (p < 0.02), a gene mediating spermatozoon development, indicates cheetah fixation of five function-damaging amino acid variants distinct from AKAP4 homologues of other Felidae or mammals; AKAP4 dysfunction may cause the cheetah's extremely high (>80 %) pleiomorphic sperm.

Conclusions: The study provides an unprecedented genomic perspective for the rare cheetah, with potential relevance to the species' natural history, physiological adaptations and unique reproductive disposition."
Profiling unauthorized natural resource users for better targeting of conservation interventions,"['Harrison, M', 'Baker, J', 'Twinamatsiko, M', 'Milner-Gulland, EJ']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/cobi.12575,DEC 2015,0,"Unauthorized use of natural resources is a key threat tomany protected areas. Approaches to reducing this threat include law enforcement and integrated conservation and development (ICD) projects, but for such ICDs to be targeted effectively, it is important to understand who is illegally using which natural resources and why. The nature of unauthorized behavior makes it difficult to ascertain this information through direct questioning. Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, has many ICD projects, including authorizing some local people to use certain nontimber forest resources from the park. However, despite over 25 years of ICD, unauthorized resource use continues. We used household surveys, indirect questioning (unmatched count technique), and focus group discussions to generate profiles of authorized and unauthorized resource users and to explore motivations for unauthorized activity. Overall, unauthorized resource use was most common among people from poor households who lived closest to the park boundary and farthest from roads and trading centers. Other motivations for unauthorized resource use included crop raiding by wild animals, inequity of revenue sharing, and lack of employment, factors that created resentment among the poorest communities. In some communities, benefits obtained from ICD were reported to be the greatest deterrents against unauthorized activity, although law enforcement ranked highest overall. Despite the sensitive nature of exploring unauthorized resource use, management-relevant insights into the profiles and motivations of unauthorized resource users can be gained from a combination of survey techniques, as adopted here. To reduce unauthorized activity at Bwindi, we suggest ICD benefit the poorest people living in remote areas and near the park boundary by providing affordable alternative sources of forest products and addressing crop raiding. To prevent resentment from driving further unauthorized activity, ICDs should be managed transparently and equitably."

"Conservation research presence protects: a case study of great ape abundance in the Dja region, Cameroon","['Tagg, N', 'Willie, J', 'Duarte, J', 'Petre, CA', 'Fa, JE']",ANIMAL CONSERVATION,10.1111/acv.12212,DEC 2015,1,"Research programmes have been shown to exert a positive impact on faunal communities, but few studies provide empirical evidence. In this study, we surveyed three neighbouring sites, differing in terms of official protection status and level of active management, in the Dja Conservation Complex, southeast Cameroon. We recorded signs of human activity and anthropogenic pressures and found that they significantly differed by site. We assessed chimpanzee and gorilla relative abundance using nest count surveys. We found that chimpanzee nest abundance was related to the presence of active management, but both active management and availability of suitable habitat affected gorilla nest abundance. Our results suggest that gorillas are more tolerant of human activity. We also provide evidence that the presence and activities of the conservation research project Projet Grands Singes served to actively deter poachers and limit hunting of great apes as a result of researcher presence, community sensitization and of valuing living apes and intact forests by local people. Such empirical evidence for the positive effect of research activity on biodiversity preservation should encourage continued investment in such programmes as part of a landscape-wide, multi-stakeholder conservation management of great ape habitats."
Long-Term Spatial Memory and Learning Set Formation in Captive Capuchin Monkeys (Cebus libidinosus = Sapajus cay),"['Tujague, MP', 'Janson, CH', 'Lahitte, HB']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-015-9878-5,DEC 2015,0,"Researchers have long suspected that nonhuman primates have long-term spatial memory for locating food. However, few empirical studies have assessed spatial memory for a period longer than 1 day in nonhuman primates in a foraging context. We used a modified version of the radial maze to test long-term memory for periods of 2 days or longer in two groups of Cebus libidinosus = Sapajus cay (N = 10; N = 6) in captivity (environment completely human constructed) and semicaptivity (relatively natural environment with few human-made structures) at La Plata Zoo and Botanical Park, Buenos Aires, Argentina, between 2007 and 2010. The experimental design included a set of three accessible baited feeders interspersed among three nonaccessible baited feeders. We tested monkeys in one initial exposure period, four periods of long-term memory (2 days, 76 days, 76 + 2 days, and 4 months of delay), and one period of inversion of the experimental set location. We used the latter to analyze the monkeys' abilities to develop learning sets. Captive subjects appeared to remember sites with accessible and nonaccessible food for periods of 2 days, 76 days, and 4 months, and used learning sets to reduce relearning times when exposed to a change in the learned locations. Although semicaptive subjects also appeared to remember sites with accessible and nonaccessible food, their performance was less accurate. We conclude that capuchins used spatial memory to improve their foraging efficiency."
Implications of the Relationship Between Basicranial Flexion and Facial Orientation for the Evolution of Hominid Craniofacial Structures,"['Neaux, D', 'Gilissen, E', 'Coudyzer, W', 'Guy, F']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-015-9886-5,DEC 2015,0,"The basicranium and face have been linked through genetic, developmental, and functional relationships throughout their evolution. As a result, basicranial morphology most likely plays a major role in the evolution of facial structures. We describe the relationships between basicranial flexion and the face in Homo, Pan, and Gorilla to determine the role of cranial base angle reduction in the setup of the short and orthognathic face of Homo. We test the hypotheses that cranial base flexion plays a significant part in variation in facial orientation, length, and projection at the intraspecific level. The sample comprised 125 crania of adult specimens including 66 Homo sapiens, 32 Pan troglodytes, and 27 Gorilla gorilla. We described the cranial base and face using landmarks placed on scans of the surfaces and computed correlations between the cranial base angle and facial orientation, length, and projection. Our results support the hypotheses that cranial base flexion plays a significant part in facial orientation for Homo and Pan and in facial length for Pan. The hypothesis that basicranial flexion is related to a reduction of facial projection is not supported. The findings suggest that basicranial flexion can explain several anatomical specificities of hominins, including the reduction of prognathism and the reduction of the length of the nasopharynx. We found different patterns in the different genera, highlighting the fact that changes in the relationship between craniofacial structures may have occurred during hominid evolution."
"HIV-1 group O infection in Cameroon from 2006 to 2013: Prevalence, genetic diversity, evolution and public health challenges","['Villabona-Arenas, CJ', 'Domyeum, J', 'Mouacha, F', 'Butel, C', 'Delaporte, E', 'Peeters, M', 'Mpoudi-Ngole, E', 'Aghokeng, AF']",INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.09.006,DEC 2015,0,"The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is characterized by a tremendously high genetic diversity, leading to the currently known circulating HIV types, groups, subtypes, and recombinant forms. HIV-1 group O is one of the most diverse forms of HIV-1 and has been so far related to Cameroon or individuals originating from Cameroon. In this study, we investigated in Cameroon, the evolution of this viral group from 2006 to 2013, in terms of prevalence, genetic diversity and public health implications. Our results confirmed the predominance of HIV-1 group M (98.5%), a very low prevalence (<0.02%) for HIV-1 group N and P, and HIV-2 in this country. HIV-1 group O was found at around 0.6% (95% confidence interval: 0.4-0.8%), indicating that the frequency of this virus in Cameroon has remained stable over the last decades. However, we found an extensive high genetic diversity within this HIV-1 group, that resulted from previous steady increase on the effective number of HIV-1 group O infections through time, and the current distribution of the circulating viral strains still does not allow classification as subtypes. The frequency of dual infections with HIV-1 group M and group O was 0.8% (95% confidence interval: 0.6-1.0%), but we found no recombinant forms in co-infected patients. Natural resistance to integrase inhibitors was not identified, although we found several mutations considered as natural polymorphisms. Our study shows that infections with HIV-1 group O can be adequately managed in countries where the virus circulates, but this complex virus still represents a challenge for diagnostics and monitoring strategies.

Assessing the Unseen Bacterial Diversity in Microbial Communities.,"['Caro-Quintero, Alejandro', 'Ochman, Howard']",Genome biology and evolution,10.1093/gbe/evv234,2015 Nov 27,0,"For both historical and technical reasons, 16S ribosomal RNA has been the most common molecular marker used to analyze the contents of microbial communities. However, its slow rate of evolution hinders the resolution of closely related bacteria-individual 16S-phylotypes, particularly when clustered at 97% sequence identity, conceal vast amounts of species- and strain-level variation. Protein-coding genes, which evolve more quickly, are useful for differentiating among more recently diverged lineages, but their application is complicated by difficulties in designing low-redundancy primers that amplify homologous regions from distantly related taxa. Given the now-common practice of multiplexing hundreds of samples, adopting new genes usually entails the synthesis of large sets of barcoded primers. To circumvent problems associated with use of protein-coding genes to survey microbial communities, we develop an approach-termed phyloTAGs-that offers an automatic solution for primer design and can be easily adapted to target different taxonomic groups and/or different protein-coding regions. We applied this method to analyze diversity within the gorilla gut microbiome and recovered hundreds of strains that went undetected after deep-sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons. PhyloTAGs provides a powerful way to recover the fine-level diversity within microbial communities and to study stability and dynamics of bacterial populations.   The Author(s) 2015.

"Cocirculation of Two env Molecular Variants, of Possible Recombinant Origin, in Gorilla and Chimpanzee Simian Foamy Virus Strains from Central Africa","['Richard, L', 'Rua, R', 'Betsem, E', 'Mouinga-Ondeme, A', 'Kazanji, M', 'Leroy, E', 'Njouom, R', 'Buseyne, F', 'Afonso, PV', 'Gessain, A']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.01798-15,DEC 2015,0,"Simian foamy virus (SFV) is a ubiquitous retrovirus in nonhuman primates (NHPs) that can be transmitted to humans, mostly through severe bites. In the past few years, our laboratory has identified more than 50 hunters from central Africa infected with zoonotic SFVs. Analysis of the complete sequences of five SFVs obtained from these individuals revealed that env was the most variable gene. Furthermore, recombinant SFV strains, some of which involve sequences in the env gene, were recently identified. Here, we investigated the variability of the env genes of zoonotic SFV strains and searched for possible recombinants. We sequenced the complete env gene or its surface glycoprotein region (SU) from DNA amplified from the blood of (i) a series of 40 individuals from Cameroon or Gabon infected with a gorilla or chimpanzee foamy virus (FV) strain and (ii) 1 gorilla and 3 infected chimpanzees living in the same areas as these hunters. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of two env variants among both the gorilla and chimpanzee FV strains that were present in zoonotic and NHP strains. These variants differ greatly (>30% variability) in a 753-bp-long region located in the receptor-binding domain of SU, whereas the rest of the gene is very conserved. Although the organizations of the Env protein sequences are similar, the potential glycosylation patterns differ between variants. Analysis of recombination suggests that the variants emerged through recombination between different strains, although all parental strains could not be identified.

IMPORTANCE

SFV infection in humans is a great example of a zoonotic retroviral infection that has not spread among human populations, in contrast to human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) and human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs). Recombination was a major mechanism leading to the emergence of HIV. Here, we show that two SFV molecular envelope gene variants circulate among ape populations in Central Africa and that both can be transmitted to humans. These variants differ greatly in the SU region that corresponds to the part of the Env protein in contact with the environment. These variants may have emerged through recombination between SFV strains infecting different NHP species."
Toward the integration of optical sensors in smartphone screens using femtosecond laser writing,"['Lapointe, J', 'Parent, F', 'de Lima, ES', 'Loranger, S', 'Kashyap, R']",OPTICS LETTERS,10.1364/OL.40.005654,DEC 1 2015,0,"We demonstrate a new type of sensor incorporated directly into Corning Gorilla glass, an ultraresistant glass widely used in the screen of popular devices such as smartphones, tablets, and smart watches. Although physical space is limited in portable devices, the screens have been so far neglected in regard to functionalization. Our proof-of-concept shows a new niche for photonics device development, in which the screen becomes an active component integrated into the device. The sensor itself is a near-surface waveguide, sensitive to refractive index changes, enabling the analysis of liquids directly on the screen of a smart-phone, without the need for any add-ons, thus opening this part of the device to advanced functionalization. The primary function of the screen is unaffected, since the sensor and waveguide are effectively invisible to the naked eye. We fabricated a waveguide just below the glass surface, directly written without any surface preparation, in which the change in refractive index on the surface-air interface changes the light guidance, thus the transmission of light. This work reports on sensor fabrication, using a femtosecond pulsed laser, and the light-interaction model of the beam propagating at the surface is discussed and compared with experimental measurement for refractive indexes in the range 1.3-1.7. A new and improved model, including input and output reflections due to the effective mode index change, is also proposed and yields a better match with our experimental measurements and also with previous measurements reported in the literature.

"Forearm articular proportions and the antebrachial index in Homo sapiens, Australopithecus afarensis and the great apes","['Williams, FL', 'Cunningham, DL', 'Amaral, LQ']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jchb.2015.07.001,2015,0,"When hominin bipedality evolved, the forearms were free to adopt nonlocomotor tasks which may have resulted in changes to the articular surfaces of the ulna and the relative lengths of the forearm bones. Similarly, sex differences in forearm proportions may be more likely to emerge in bipeds than in the great apes given the locomotor constraints in Gorilla, Pan and Pongo. To test these assumptions, ulnar articular proportions and the antebrachial index (radius length/ulna length) in Homo sapiens (n=51), Gorilla gorilla (n=88), Pan troglodytes (n=49), Pongo pygrnaeus (n=36) and Australopithecus afarensis A.L. 288-1 and A.L. 438-1 are compared. Intercept-adjusted ratios are used to control for size and minimize the effects of allometry. Canonical scores axes show that the proximally broad and elongated trochlear notch with respect to size in H. sapiens and A. afarensis is largely distinct from G. gorilla, P. troglodytes and P. pygmaeus. A cluster analysis of scaled ulnar articular dimensions groups H. sapiens males with A.L. 438-1 ulna length estimates, while one A.L. 288-1 ulna length estimate groups with Pan and another clusters most closely with H. sapiens, G. gorilla and A.L. 438-1. The relatively low antebrachial index Characterizing H. sapiens and non-outlier estimates of A.L. 288-1 and A.L. 438-1 differs from those of the great apes. Unique sex differences in H. sapiens suggest a link between bipedality and forearm functional morphology. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."
"Audience effects, but not environmental influences, explain variation in gorilla close distance vocalizations-A test of the acoustic adaptation hypothesis","['Hedwig, D', 'Mundry, R', 'Robbins, MM', 'Boesch, C']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22462,DEC 2015,0,"Close distance vocalizations are an integral part of primate vocal communication. They exhibit large acoustic variation which has been suggested to constitute flexible responses to the highly variable social setting of group living animals. However, a recent study suggested that acoustic variation in close distance calls of baboons may also arise from acoustic adaptations to environmental factors in order to counteract sound degradation. We tested whether the variation in calling rate and acoustic structure of gorilla close distance vocalizations may serve to counteract distorting effects of vegetation during sound propagation. Using focal animal sampling we recorded the vocal behavior of 15 adult individuals living in two groups: one group of western lowland gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla and one group of mountain gorillas Gorilla beringei beringei. We considered the distance between the caller and its nearest neighbor as the minimum transmission distance of calls; while vegetation density was quantified through measures of visibility. Our analysis revealed vocal plasticity in gorilla close calls in relation to changes in visibility and nearest neighbor distance. However, the observed changes in fundamental frequency and calling rate are unlikely to counteract degrading effects of vegetation, but rather seem to reflect reactions to variation in spatial and visual separation from other group members, similar to the audience effects demonstrated in a range of other species. We propose that vocal plasticity to counteract distorting environmental effects may not be prevalent across taxa and perhaps confined to species living in heterogeneous habitats with highly variable transmission conditions.

Agonism and dominance in female blue monkeys,"['Klass, K', 'Cords, M']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22481,DEC 2015,0,"Agonistic behavior features prominently in hypotheses that explain how social variation relates to ecological factors and phylogenetic constraints. Dominance systems vary along axes of despotism, tolerance, and nepotism, and comparative studies examine cross-species patterns in these classifications. To contribute to such studies, we present a comprehensive picture of agonistic behavior and dominance relationships in wild female blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis), an arboreal guenon, with data from 9 groups spanning 18 years. We assessed where blue monkeys fall along despotic, tolerant, and nepotistic spectra, how their dominance system compares to other primates, primarily cercopithecines, and whether their agonistic behavior matches socioecological model predictions. Blue monkeys showed low rates of mainly low-intensity agonism and little counter-aggression. Rates increased with rank and group size. Dominance asymmetry varied at different organizational levels, being more pronounced at the level of interactions than dyad or group. Hierarchies were quite stable, had moderate-to-high linearity and directional consistency and moderate steepness. There was clear maternal rank inheritance, but inconsistent adherence to Kawamura's rules. There was little between-group variation, although hierarchy metrics showed considerable variation across group-years. Overall, blue monkeys have moderately despotic, moderately tolerant, and nepotistic dominance hierarchies. They resemble other cercopithecines in having significantly linear and steep hierarchies with a generally stable, matriline-based structure, suggesting a phylogenetic basis to this aspect of their social system. Blue monkeys most closely match Sterck et al.'s [1997] Resident-Nepotistic-Tolerant dominance category, although they do not fully conform to predictions of any one socioecological model. Our results suggest that socioecological models might better predict variation within than across clades, thereby incorporating both ecological variables and phylogenetic constraints. Our findings also highlight the need for clearer definitions of socioecologically relevant dominance categories, which would ideally derive from quantitative measures of dominance behavior. Intraspecific and methodological variation may, however, be a challenge. Am. J. Primatol. 77:1299-1315, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Despite their longevity and phylogenetic relatedness to humans, the effects of aging on motor function in non-human apes have been minimally studied. We conducted two experiments with western lowland gorillas (11-54 years of age) to determine whether aged gorillas exhibit motor deficits similar to those seen in other species. In experiment one, gorillas extracted up to 12 food rewards lodged in holes of a Lexan board. Extraction rates were calculated for eight test sessions. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed no main effects of session or sex on extraction rate, but a significant main effect of age. Comparisons between the first and last sessions showed that experience significantly improved extraction rates in young but not aged gorillas. In experiment two, gorillas retrieved a hex nut from three differently shaped rods with each hand for a reward. Latencies of retrieval were calculated for 16 test sessions. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant main effects of age class, sex, and session. There were significant interactions between session and sex, session and age, and session, sex, and age. These findings held when analyzing each rod shape separately. Post hoc comparisons revealed that young gorillas were significantly faster at the task than aged gorillas, and females were faster than males. This finding held only for the question mark shaped rod when analyzing each rod shape separately. Comparisons between the first and last sessions showed that experience did not significantly improve latencies in either age or sex class. The direction of these results are congruent with previous findings in humans and monkeys and suggest that aged gorillas experience deficits in bimanual coordination compared to younger gorillas and that age and sex influence fine motor ability in gorillas.

The recent development of non-invasive methods allowed re-exploration of plasmodial diversity in African apes. Although a large number of great ape populations have now been studied regarding Plasmodium infections in Africa, there are still vast areas of their distribution that remained unexplored. Gabon constitutes an important part of the range of western central African great ape subspecies (Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla), but has not been studied so far. In the present study, the diversity of Plasmodium species circulating in great apes in Gabon was analysed.

METHODS: The analysis of 1,261 faecal samples from 791 chimpanzees and 470 gorillas collected from 24 sites all over Gabon was performed. Plasmodium infections were characterized by amplification and sequencing of a portion of the Plasmodium cytochrome b gene.

RESULTS: The analysis of the 1,261 samples revealed that at least six Plasmodium species circulate in great apes in Gabon (Plasmodium praefalciparum, Plasmodium gorA (syn Plasmodium adleri), Plasmodium gorB (syn Plasmodium blacklocki) in gorillas and Plasmodium gaboni, P. reichenowi and Plasmodium billcollinsi in chimpanzees). No new phylogenetic lineages were discovered. The average infection rate was 21.3% for gorillas and 15.4% for chimpanzees. A logistic regression showed that the probability of infection was significantly dependent on the freshness of the droppings but not of the host species or of the average pluviometry of the months of collection."

In the initial study, we assessed the influence of grip morphology on hand use for simple reaching in a sample of 564 great apes including 49 orangutans Pongo pygmaeus, 66 gorillas Gorilla gorilla, 354 chimpanzees Pan troglodytes and 95 bonobos Pan paniscus. Overall, we found a significant right hand bias for reaching. We also found a significant effect of the grip morphology of hand use. Grasping with the thumb and index finger was more prevalent in the right compared to left hand in all four species. There was no significant sex effect on the patterns of handedness. In a subsample of apes, we also compared consistency in hand use for simple reaching with previously published data on a task that measures handedness for bimanual actions. We found that the ratio of subjects with consistent right compared to left hand use was more prevalent in bonobos, chimpanzees and gorillas but not orangutans. However, for all species, the proportion of subjects with inconsistent hand preferences between the tasks was relatively high suggesting some measures may be more sensitive in assessing handedness than others."
The Season for Peace: Reconciliation in a Despotic Species (Lemur catta),"['Palagi, E', 'Norscia, I']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0142150,NOV 16 2015,0,"However despotic a social group may be, managing conflicts of interest is crucial to preserve group living benefits, mainly based on cooperation. In despotic groups, post-conflict management via reconciliation (the first post-conflict reunion between former opponents) can occur, even if conciliatory rates are considerably different. Lemur catta is defined as a despotic species because groups are characterized by a strict linear hierarchy maintained by the adult females (the dominant sex) mainly via aggression. Reconciliation was reported in one out of four captive groups of L. catta. Here we investigate which variables influence the occurrence of reconciliation in these despotic groups. We analyzed 2339 Post Conflict (PC)-Matched Control (MC) observation pairs, collected on eight groups (five in the Berenty forest, Madagascar; three hosted at the Pistoia Zoo, Italy). Since L. catta is characterized by steep female dominance but shows female-female coalitionary support, we expected to confirm the presence of reconciliation in the study species. Consistently, we found reconciliation in one captive group and two wild groups, thus providing the first evidence of the presence of this phenomenon in wild L. catta. Moreover, because this species is a seasonal breeder (with mating occurring once a year), we expected seasonal fluctuations in reconciliation levels. Via a GLMM analysis using data from all wild groups and on a captive group followed for more than one year, we found that season (but not rank; individuals' identity, sex, and age; or group identity) significantly affected individual reconciliation rates, and such rates were lowest during the mating period. Thus, reconciliation can be present in groups in which dominants strongly influence and limit social relationships (steep dominance hierarchy) except when the advantages of intra-group cooperation are overcome by competition, as occurs in seasonal breeders when reproduction is at stake. We conclude that in despotic social groups in which coalitions are observed, the right question is not if but when reconciliation can be present."
Central memory CD4+T cells are preferential targets of double infection by HIV-1,"['Haqqani, AA', 'Marek, SL', 'Kumar, J', 'Davenport, M', 'Wang, H', 'Tilton, JC']",Virology Journal,10.1186/s12985-015-0415-0,NOV 11 2015,0,"Background: Template switching between two distinct HIV-1 RNA genomes during reverse transcription gives rise to recombinant viruses that greatly expand the genetic diversity of HIV-1 and have adverse implications for drug resistance, immune escape, and vaccine design. Virions with two distinct genomes are produced exclusively from cells infected with two or more viruses, or 'doubly infected' cells. Previous studies have revealed higher than expected frequencies of doubly infected cells compared to frequencies based on chance alone, suggesting non-random enhancement of double infection.

Methods: We investigated double infection of unstimulated primary CD4+ T cells using reporter viruses carrying genes for different fluorescent proteins, EGFP and mCherry, combined with sophisticated modeling techniques based on Poisson distribution. Additionally, through the use of multiparameter flow cytometry we examined the susceptibility of naive and memory subsets of CD4+ T cells to double infection by HIV.

Results: Using our double infection system, we confirm non-random enhancement of multiple infection events. Double infection of CD4+ T cells was not found to be a consequence of suboptimal provirus expression rescued by Tat in trans-as has been reported in cell lines-but rather due to a heterogeneous cell population in which only a fraction of primary peripheral blood CD4+ T cells are susceptible to HIV infection regardless of viral titer. Intriguingly, double infection of CD4+ T cells occurred preferentially in memory CD4+ T cells-particularly the central memory (TCM) subset-but was not a consequence of SAMHD1-mediated restriction of HIV infection in naive cells.

Conclusions: These findings reveal that double infection in primary CD4+ T cells is primarily a consequences of cellular heterogeneity and not rescue of suboptimal provirus expression by Tat in trans. Additionally, we report a previously unappreciated phenomenon of enhanced double infection within primary TCM cells and suggest that these long-lived cells may serve as an archive that drive ongoing viral recombination events in vivo."
Ghost-in-the-Machine reveals human social signals for human-robot interaction,"['Loth, S', 'Jettka, K', 'Giuliani, M', 'de Ruiter, JP']",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01641,NOV 4 2015,0,"We used a new method called ""Ghost-in-the-Machine"" (GiM) to investigate social interactions with a robotic bartender taking orders for drinks and serving them. Using the GiM paradigm allowed us to identify how human participants recognize the intentions of customers on the basis of the output of the robotic recognizers. Specifically, we measured which recognizer modalities (e.g., speech, the distance to the bar) were relevant at different stages of the interaction. This provided insights into human social behavior necessary for the development of socially competent robots. When initiating the drink-order interaction, the most important recognizers were those based on computer vision. When drink orders were being placed, however, the most important information source was the speech recognition. Interestingly, the participants used only a subset of the available information, focussing only on a few relevant recognizers while ignoring others. This reduced the risk of acting on erroneous sensor data and enabled them to complete service interactions more swiftly than a robot using all available sensor data. We also investigated socially appropriate response strategies. In their responses, the participants preferred to use the same modality as the customer's requests, e.g., they tended to respond verbally to verbal requests. Also, they added redundancy to their responses, for instance by using echo questions. We argue that incorporating the social strategies discovered with the GiM paradigm in multimodal grammars of human robot interactions improves the robustness and the ease-of-use of these interactions, and therefore provides a smoother user experience."
TRACK - A new method for the evaluation of low-level extinction coefficient in optical films,"['Vernhes, R', 'Martinu, L']",OPTICS EXPRESS,10.1364/OE.23.028501,NOV 2 2015,0,"We develop a rigorous methodology named TRACK based on the collection of multi-angle spectrophotometric transmission and reflection data in order to assess the extinction coefficient of quasi-transparent optical films. The accuracy of extinction coefficient values obtained by this method is not affected by sample non-idealities (thickness non-uniformity, refractive index inhomogeneities, anisotropy, interfaces, etc.) and therefore a simple two-layer (substrate/film) optical model can be used. The method requires the acquisition of transmission and reflection data at two angles of incidence: 10 degrees and 65 degrees in p polarization. Data acquired at 10 degrees provide information about the film thickness and the refractive index, while data collected at 65 degrees are used for absorption evaluation and extinction coefficient computation. We test this method on three types of samples: (i) a CR-39 plastic substrate coated with a thick protective coating; (ii) the same substrate coated with a thin TiO2 film; (iii) and a thick Si3N4 film deposited on Gorilla glass that presents thickness non-uniformity and refractive index gradient non-idealities. We also compare absorption and extinction coefficient values obtained at 410 and 550 nm by both TRACK and Laser Induced Deflection techniques in the case of a 1 micron thick TiO2 coating. Both methods display consistent extinction coefficient values in the 10(-4) and 10(-5) ranges at 410 and 550 nm, respectively, which proves the validity of the methodology and provides an estimate of its accuracy limit.

Western Lowland Gorilla (Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla) Birth Patterns and Human Presence in Zoological Settings,"['Kurtycz, LMB', 'Ross, SR']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21243,NOV-DEC 2015,0,"There is some evidence to suggest that zoo visitors may have a disruptive impact on zoo-housed animals, especially primates. While some consider western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) to be particularly reactive to large crowds, the evidence of these effects is mixed, and is likely highly influenced by exhibit design, and group composition. While the majority of studies have focused on behavioral responses to human presence, there is the potential for physiological effects as well, including the possibility of affecting the timing of parturition. Such effects have been demonstrated in laboratory-housed callitrichids and chimpanzees, but unlike laboratory settings where human presence is lowest during the weekends, human presence might peak during weekends in public zoo settings. However, in a study of zoo-housed chimpanzees, there were no significant differences between the number of chimpanzee births that occurred on weekdays compared to weekends [Wagner and Ross, 2008], and we sought to test these questions with gorillas. We analyzed the timing of 336 live gorilla births and 48 stillbirths at 53 accredited North American zoos from 1985-2014, and similarly to chimpanzees, found no weekend or weekday effect on number of births (live births: G = 0.000, p = 1; stillbirths: G = 0.166, p < 0.684). These data add to our understanding of the potential influence of human presence on primate behavior and physiology, and add to evidence suggesting that the effects of zoo visitors on exhibited species may be less profound than previously assumed.

Results: We report the first two cases of cleft lip in wild chimpanzees. Additionally, some other chimpanzees in the Sebitoli community show facial dysplasia and congenital anomalies, such as patches of depigmented hairs and limb defects.

Conclusions: Cleft lip has been documented in several species of nonhuman primates, but much remains unknown about the occurrence of cleft lip and cleft palate in great apes, probably because such malformations are rare, wild apes are difficult to monitor and observe, and severe cases associated with cleft palates render suckling impossible and lead to early death of infants. The genetic basis of such defects in great apes warrants investigation, as does the possibility that environmental toxins contribute to their etiology in Kibale in ways that could affect humans as well."
Skeletal development of hallucal tarsometatarsal joint curvature and angulation in extant apes and modern humans,"['Gill, CM', 'Bredella, MA', 'DeSilva, JM', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.07.003,NOV 2015,0,"The medial cuneiform, namely the curvature and angulation of its distal facet with metatarsal 1, is crucial as a stabilizer in bipedal locomotion and an axis upon which the great toe medially deviates during arboreal locomotion in extant apes. Previous work has shown that facet curvature and angulation in adult dry-bone specimens can distinguish African apes from Homo, and can even distinguish among species of Gorilla. This study provides the first ontogenetic assessment of medial cuneiform curvature and angulation in juvenile (n = 68) and adult specimens (n = 102) using computed tomography in humans and extant ape specimens, including Pongo. Our data find that modern human juveniles initially have a convex and slightly medially oriented osseous surface of the developing medial cuneiform distal facet that flattens and becomes more distally oriented with age. The same pattern (though of a different magnitude) occurs developmentally in the chimpanzee medial cuneiform, but not in Gorilla or Pongo, whose medial cuneiform facet angulation remains unchanged ontogenetically. These data suggest that the medial cuneiform ossifies in a distinguishable pattern between Pongo, Gorilla, Pan, and Homo, which may in part be due to subtle differences in the loading environment at the hallucal tarsometatarsal joint a finding that has important implications for interpreting fossil medial cuneiforms.

Beating Their Chests: University Students With ADHD Demonstrate Greater Attentional Abilities on an Inattentional Blindness Paradigm,"['Grossman, ES', 'Hoffman, YSG', 'Berger, I', 'Zivotofsky, AZ']",NEUROPSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/neu0000189,NOV 2015,0,"Objective: Adults diagnosed with attentional deficit disorder (ADHD) are easily distracted in many tasks. Yet ADHD performance on inattentional blindness (IB) tasks has not been examined. Such investigation may aid in discriminating between 3 ADHD models: the neurological model, the perceptual load theory, and the ""hunter versus farmer"" hypothesis. Method: Distractibility was assessed in ADHD and non-ADHD college students using the MOXO task that involves detection of a single attended stimulus that repeatedly appears in the same place and in the well-known IB ""gorilla"" video which involves tracking of a stimulus moving at a fast pace in a dynamic, complex manner. Results: ADHD college students showed increased distractibility in the MOXO task. By contrast, they performed better than controls in the attended channel of the IB task, while they were also better at noticing the unattended stimuli and thus exhibiting little-to-no inattentional blindness. Conclusions: As no attentional tradeoffs were evident in the IB task, it appears that the results are most consistent with the ""hunter versus farmer"" hypothesis, which postulates that ADHD individuals have an alternative cognitive style which is less equipped to deal with detection of repeated stimuli while comprising advantages in the tracking of stimuli moving in a fast dynamic manner."
Choice and control for animals in captivity,"['Kurtycz, LM']",PSYCHOLOGIST,NA,NOV 2015,0,"Today, by reading this sentence, you made a choice about what to do with your time. In fact, every day you make dozens of choices that you may not even realise you are making - what to do, when to eat, where to go, with whom to spend time ... the possibilities are nearly endless. However, when we lack control over our actions, we can suffer from 'learned helplessness' and we may stop trying to make choices altogether. The same is true for animals living in captivity.

For some animals this can lead to serious negative consequences evidenced behaviourally and physiologically. Could providing choices to captive animals alleviate the symptoms associated with a Lack of control and improve welfare? And what might it be able to tell us about their cognition and decision making?"
Being a victim or an aggressor: Different functions of triadic post-conflict interactions in wolves (Canis lupus lupus),"['Cordoni, G', 'Palagi, E']",AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR,10.1002/ab.21590,NOV-DEC 2015,0,"Animals adopt different behavioral strategies to cope with the conflict of interests coming from the competition over limited resources. Starting from the study on chimpanzees, post-conflict third-party affiliation (the affiliative contact provided by a third-party toward the victimVTAor the aggressorATA) was investigated mainly in primates. Later, this post-conflict mechanism has been demonstrated also in other mammals, such as wallabies, horses, dolphins, domestic dogs, and wolves. Here, we present data on triadic post-conflict affiliation in wolves (Canis lupus lupus) by exploring some of the hypotheses already proposed for primates and never tested before in other social mammals. In this carnivore species, the study of VTA and ATA revealed that these strategies cannot be considered as a unique behavioral category since they differ in many functional aspects. VTA serves to protect the victim by reducing the likelihood of reiterated attacks from the previous aggressor and to reinforce the relationship shared by the third-party and the victim. On the other hand, ATA has a role in bystander protection by limiting the renewed attacks of the previous aggressor toward uninvolved group-members (potential third-parties). In conclusion, exploring VTA and ATA gives the opportunity to concurrently demonstrate some functional differences in triadic post-conflict affiliation according to the different targets of bystanders (victims or aggressors). The data comparison between primates and other social mammals should permit to open new lines of research. Aggr. Behav. 41:526-536, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Cross-sectional structural variation relative to midshaft along hominine diaphyses. I. The forelimb,"['Mongle, CS', 'Wallace, IJ', 'Grine, FE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22799,NOV 2015,0,"ObjectivesAnalyses of hominine forelimb diaphyseal structure typically employ sections located at midshaft. This study addresses three questions. First, how accurately must midshaft be defined to yield comparable data? Second, does variation in midshaft location due to alternative definitions fall within error ranges such that data gathered using different length measurements are comparable? Third, do error ranges and length metric effects differ between elements or taxa such that certain bones or species are more prone to issues of comparability?

Materials and MethodsHumeri, radii, and ulnae of Homo, Pan, and Gorilla were CT-scanned at full length and error ranges for three structural parameters (CSA, J, I-max/I-min) were calculated around midshafts.

ResultsDistances proximally and distally from midshaft where structural values become significantly different from midshaft values vary between elements, taxa, and structural parameters. Error ranges are largest for the humerus and smallest for the ulna. Among taxa, error ranges for gorillas are largest and those for humans are smallest. Among structural parameters, error ranges depend on element and taxon such that no parameter consistently exhibits larger or smaller error ranges across all bones or species. Variation in midshaft locations originating from different length definitions is small and falls within error ranges defined by maximum length across all elements and taxa.

DiscussionIncluding fragmentary specimens for which midshaft location is uncertain in comparisons of forelimb diaphyseal structure requires evaluation on a case-by-case basis, with consideration to element, taxon, and structural traits of interest.

Here, we address three questions. First, how accurately must midshaft be defined to yield comparable data? Second, does variation in midshaft location due to different ways of measuring length fall within error ranges such that data gathered using different metrics are comparable? Third, do error ranges and length metric effects differ between elements or taxa such that certain bones or species are more prone to issues of comparability?

Materials and MethodsFemora and tibiae of Homo, Pan, and Gorilla were CT-scanned longitudinally and error ranges for multiple structural parameters (CSA, J, I-max/I-min) were calculated around midshafts.

ResultsDistances proximally and distally from midshaft where structural values differ significantly from midshaft values vary between bones, species, and structural traits. Femoral error ranges are typically larger than tibial ranges. In the femur, error ranges are generally largest for chimpanzees and smallest for gorillas. A similar taxonomic pattern is not evident in the tibia. No structural trait consistently displays larger or smaller error ranges across both elements and all species. Variation in midshaft locations stemming from different length definitions is small and falls within observed error ranges defined by any one metric.

Integration between the face and the mandible of Pongo and the evolution of the craniofacial morphology of orangutans,"['Neaux, D', 'Gilissen, E', 'Coudyzer, W', 'Guy, F']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22807,NOV 2015,0,"ObjectivesExtant Pongo diverges from other hominids by a series of craniofacial morphological features, such as a concave face, a reduced supraorbital torus, or an upwardly orientated palate. These traits are not independent because the skull is a complex integrated structure. The aim of this study is to describe the relationship between the face and mandible of Pongo, in order to examine the link between mandibular structures and the set-up of the unique facial features of orangutans.

Materials and methodsUsing 3D geometric morphometrics, the morphological integration between face and mandible of Pongo is compared to that of the three extant hominids: Homo, Pan, and Gorilla. Pooled within-species partial least squares analyses are computed in order to quantify the patterns and levels of integration.

ResultsThe covariation analyses show unique patterns of integration and levels of correlation in Pongo when compared to other hominids. This study shows that the craniofacial features distinguishing Pongo from African great apes are related to differences in the patterns of integration and levels of correlation between facial and mandibular shape.

DiscussionChanges in important functions may play a part in these modifications of craniofacial integration.

Energetic responses to variation in food availability in the two mountain gorilla populations (Gorilla beringei beringei),"['Wright, E', 'Grueter, CC', 'Seiler, N', 'Abavandimwe, D', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Ortmann, S', 'Robbins, MM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22808,NOV 2015,1,"ObjectiveHere, we compare food availability and relate this to differences in energy intake rates, time spent feeding, and daily travel distance of gorillas in the two populations.

Comparative intraspecific studies investigating spatiotemporal variation in food availability can help us understand the complex relationships between ecology, behavior, and life history in primates and are relevant to understanding hominin evolution. Differences in several variables have been documented between the two mountain gorilla populations in the Virunga Massif and Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, but few direct comparisons that link ecological conditions to feeding behavior have been made.

Materials and MethodsUsing similar data collection protocols we conducted vegetation sampling and nutritional analysis on important foods to estimate food availability. Detailed observations of feeding behavior were used to compute energy intake rates and daily travel distance was estimated through GPS readings.

ResultsFood availability was overall lower and had greater temporal variability in Bwindi than in the Virungas. Energy intake rates and time spent feeding were similar in both populations, but energy intake rates were significantly higher in Bwindi during the period of high fruit consumption. Daily travel distances were significantly shorter in the Virungas.

ConclusionsOverall, despite the differences in food availability, we did not find large differences in the energetics of gorillas in the two populations, although further work is needed to more precisely quantify energy expenditure and energy balance. These results emphasize that even species with high food availability can exhibit behavioral and energetic responses to variable ecological conditions, which are likely to affect growth, reproduction, and survival.

The adaptive value of secondary males in the polygynous multi-level society of hamadryas baboons,"['Chowdhury, S', 'Pines, M', 'Saunders, J', 'Swedell, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22804,NOV 2015,1,"ObjectivesOne-male social systems are usually characterized by polygyny and reproductive exclusion by a single resident male. Sometimes, however, secondary males join these groups, and this may carry fitness costs and/or benefits to the resident male. In hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas hamadryas), which live in one-male units (OMUs) with female defense polygyny within a multi-level social system, secondary follower males often reside in OMUs. Our aim here is to examine possible benefits of these secondary males to hamadryas resident males.

Materials and MethodsUsing 6 years of data from 65 OMUs in a band of wild hamadryas baboons in Ethiopia, we compared demographic and reproductive parameters of OMUs with and without secondary follower males to assess whether their presence conferred any reproductive benefits to resident leader males.

ResultsLeaders with followers had tenure lengths almost twice as long, acquired more than twice as many females, retained females longer, and had three times as many infants during their tenure compared to leaders without followers.

DiscussionHamadryas follower males enabled leaders to retain females for longer periods of timelikely through unit defense, social relationships with OMU members, and/or infant protection. Hamadryas leaders appear to be able to monopolize access to females despite the presence of followers, and as such any enhanced reproduction derived from the presence of followers likely increases the fitness of the leader rather than the follower. Thus the relationship between leaders and followers in hamadryas society appears to be a mutually beneficial one and tolerance of secondary males may be an adaptive reproductive strategy characterizing hamadryas leader males.

This study explored the exon 2 variation of -DPB1, -DQB1, and -DRB genes in 46 gorillas from four populations while simultaneously evaluating the feasibility of using fecal samples for high-throughput MHC genotyping. By applying strict similarity-and frequency-based analysis, we found, despite our modest sample size, a total of 18 alleles that have not been described previously, thereby illustrating the potential for efficient and highly accurate MHC genotyping from non-invasive DNA samples. We emphasize the importance of controlling for multiple potential sources of error when applying this massively parallel short-read sequencing technology to PCR products generated from low concentration DNA extracts. We observed pronounced differences in MHC variation between species, subspecies and populations that are consistent with both the ancient and recent demographic histories experienced by gorillas.

Comparing humans and nonhuman great apes in the broken cloth problem: Is their knowledge causal or perceptual?,"['Albiach-Serrano, A', 'Sebastian-Enesco, C', 'Seed, A', 'Colmenares, F', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY,10.1016/j.jecp.2015.06.004,NOV 2015,0,"When presented with the broken cloth problem, both human children and nonhuman great apes prefer to pull a continuous cloth over a discontinuous cloth in order to obtain a desired object resting on top. This has been interpreted as evidence that they preferentially attend to the functionally relevant cues of the task (e.g., presence or absence of a gap along the cloth). However, there is controversy regarding whether great apes' behavior is underpinned by causal knowledge, involving abstract concepts (e.g., support, connection), or by perceptual knowledge, based on percepts (e.g., contact, continuity). We presented chimpanzees, orangutans, and 2-, 3-, and 4-year-old children with two versions of the broken cloth problem. The Real condition, made with paper strips, could be solved based on either perceptual cues or causal knowledge. The Painted condition, which looked very similar, could be solved only by attending to perceptual cues. All groups mastered the Real condition, in line with previous results. Older children (3- and 4-year-olds) performed significantly better in this condition than all other groups, but the performance of apes and children did not differ sharply, with 2-year-olds and apes obtaining similar results. In contrast, only 4-year-olds solved the Painted condition. We propose causal knowledge to explain the general good performance of apes and humans in the Real condition compared with the Painted condition. In addition, we suggest that symbolic knowledge might account for 4-year-olds' performance in the Painted condition. Our findings add to the growing literature supporting the idea that learning from arbitrary cues is not a good explanation for the performance of apes and humans on some kinds of physical task.

Accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm with interpair pruning and band optimization for the all-pairs comparison of base sequences,"['Okada, D', 'Ino, F', 'Hagihara, K']",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,10.1186/s12859-015-0744-4,OCT 6 2015,0,"Background: The Smith-Waterman algorithm is known to be a more sensitive approach than heuristic algorithms for local sequence alignment algorithms. Despite its sensitivity, a greater time complexity associated with the Smith-Waterman algorithm prevents its application to the all-pairs comparisons of base sequences, which aids in the construction of accurate phylogenetic trees. The aim of this study is to achieve greater acceleration using the Smith-Waterman algorithm (by realizing interpair block pruning and band optimization) compared with that achieved using a previous method that performs intrapair block pruning on graphics processing units (GPUs).

Results: We present an interpair optimization method for the Smith-Waterman algorithm with the aim of accelerating the all-pairs comparison of base sequences. Given the results of the pairs of sequences, our method realizes efficient block pruning by computing a lower bound for other pairs that have not yet been processed. This lower bound is further used for band optimization. We integrated our interpair optimization method into SW#, a previous GPU-based implementation that employs variants of a banded Smith-Waterman algorithm and a banded Myers-Miller algorithm. Evaluation using the six genomes of Bacillus anthracis shows that our method pruned 88 % of the matrix cells on a single GPU and 73 % of the matrix cells on two GPUs. For the genomes of the human chromosome 21, the alignment performance reached 202 giga-cell updates per second (GCUPS) on two Tesla K40 GPUs.

Conclusions: Efficient interpair pruning and band optimization makes it possible to complete the all-pairs comparisons of the sequences of the same species 1.2 times faster than the intrapair pruning method. This acceleration was achieved at the first phase of SW#, where our method significantly improved the initial lower bound. However, our interpair optimization was not effective for the comparison of the sequences of different species such as comparing human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. Consequently, our method is useful in accelerating the applications that require optimal local alignments scores for the same species.

A Case Study,"['Collins, CK', 'Marples, NM']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,10.1080/10888705.2015.1034278,OCT 2 2015,0,"There is increasing evidence that in some circumstances, zoo visitors may be aversive stimuli to nonhuman animals housed in zoos. Yet, most previous research has focused on primates with little attention given to numerous other species who are housed in zoos. The focus animal of this project was the cockatoo, a species who has received minimal attention in zoo-based research. Furthermore, although the influence of the zoo setting has become increasingly important in visitor effect studies, this is the 1st study to quantify the effect of activity at a children's playground on zoo animals. There was an investigation on the effect of a zoo playground on the behavior of citron-crested and Moluccan cockatoos (Cacatua sulphurea citrinocristata and Cacatua moluccensis), as well as the effect of children standing in front of the birds' aviaries. The results showed that in some circumstances, the Moluccan cockatoos retreated from visitors, while the citron-crested cockatoos did not retreat from visitors and became more social in the presence of visitors. These findings highlight the importance of careful selection of species and individual animals to be housed near zoo playgrounds."
Social Learning Opportunities in Captive Orangutans (Pongo abelii) and Mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx),"['Bebko, AO', 'Russon, AE']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-015-9870-0,OCT 2015,0,"Social learning is important in the acquisition of many primate behaviors, including food acquisition, object use, and sociality. Social learning opportunities are social situations in which social learning could occur and provide a means of studying influences on social learning in observational research. Species-specific characteristics and individual relationships may influence the importance of social learning opportunities for some behaviors over others. We observed eight captive orangutans (Pongo abelii) and five mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) for > 60 h each at the Toronto Zoo to assess intra- and interspecies differences in social learning opportunities. We measured social learning opportunity quality using spatial proximity because this has been associated with high-quality social learning. Both species had similar captive diets and group structure; therefore observed differences were likely due to species and individual differences, rather than captive environment. We found species differences in the frequency of social learning opportunities, their quality, and the associated type of behavior (food vs. social behavior). Orangutans had more high-quality social learning opportunities relating to food behavior than mandrills, and mandrills had more high-quality social learning opportunities relating to social behavior than orangutans. Both species had more high-quality social learning opportunities in mother-infant vs. other dyads. Our results suggest that learning about food behavior may be more important for orangutans and learning about social behavior may be more important for mandrills. Overall, our results suggest that social learning may be constrained/fostered by differences in frequency and quality of social learning opportunities between species and individuals."
A tsetse and tabanid fly survey of African great apes habitats reveals the presence of a novel trypanosome lineage but the absence of Trypanosoma brucei,"['Votypka, J', 'Radrova, J', 'Skalicky, T', 'Jirku, M', 'Jirsova, D', 'Mihalca, AD', ""D'Amico, G"", 'Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Modry, D', 'Lukes, J']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/j.ijpara.2015.06.005,OCT 2015,1,"Tsetse and tabanid flies transmit several Trypanosoma species, some of which are human and livestock pathogens of major medical and socioeconomic impact in Africa. Recent advances in molecular techniques and phylogenetic analyses have revealed a growing diversity of previously unidentified tsetse-transmitted trypanosomes potentially pathogenic to livestock and/or other domestic animals as well as wildlife, including African great apes. To map the distribution, prevalence and co-occurrence of known and novel trypanosome species, we analyzed tsetse and tabanid flies collected in the primary forested part of the Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic, which hosts a broad spectrum of wildlife including primates and is virtually devoid of domestic animals. Altogether, 564 tsetse flies and 81 tabanid flies were individually screened for the presence of trypanosomes using 18S rRNA-specific nested PCR. Herein, we demonstrate that wildlife animals are parasitized by a surprisingly wide range of trypanosome species that in some cases may circulate via these insect vectors. While one-third of the examined tsetse flies harbored trypanosomes either from the Trypanosoma theileri, Trypanosoma congolense or Trypanosoma simiae complex, or one of the three new members of the genus Trypanosoma (strains 'Bai', 'Ngbanda' and 'Didon'), more than half of the tabanid flies exclusively carried T. theileri. To establish the putative vertebrate hosts of the novel trypanosome species, we further analyzed the provenance of blood meals of tsetse flies. DNA individually isolated from 1033 specimens of Glossina spp. and subjected to high-throughput library-based screening proved that most of the examined tsetse flies engorged on wild ruminants (buffalo, sitatunga, bongo), humans and suids. Moreover, they also fed (albeit more rarely) on other vertebrates, thus providing indirect but convincing evidence that trypanosomes can be transmitted via these vectors among a wide range of warm- and cold-blooded hosts.

Decaying toxic wood as sodium supplement for herbivorous mammals in Gabon,"['Iwata, Y', 'Nakashima, Y', 'Tsuchida, S', 'Nguema, PPM', 'Ando, C', 'Ushida, K', 'Yamagiwa, J']",JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL SCIENCE,10.1292/jvms.15-0111,OCT 2015,0,"African rainforest harbors herbivores at high density. However, because plants and soils typically lack in some essential minerals, rainforest is not always a suitable habitat for herbivores. How they fulfill the mineral requirements is therefore an important question to animal ecology and conservation. Although large marshes, called 'bais', are often mentioned as efficient mineral-resource, little information on other sodium resources has still been available. Our laboratory works and field surveys found that a peculiar item, decaying wood stumps of Anthostema aubiyanum, played as a major sodium resource for herbivores in Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon. When A. aubryanum is alive, the sodium content of its bark is low and its latex is toxic. Sodium is accumulated in decaying stumps (mean=1,343 mg/kg dry matter). Eight herbivores visited stumps to ingest the dead wood. Fecal sample analysis revealed that western lowland gorillas, a species most-frequently using the stumps, consumed large amount of the dead wood as regular food. Our findings suggest that decaying A. aubryanum is critical sodium-resources and is a key species for herbivores in our study area. Importance of the A. aubryanum may be particularly large there, because it is a limited sodium-rich material that is available year round. Our study site is known as the site where the densities of several herbivores are among the highest at Central Africa. The relatively high herbivores density in our study site may partly depend on decaying A. aubryanum as sodium resources."
Hey! What's that Gorilla Doing over There?

Phylogenomic evidence for recombination of adenoviruses in wild gorillas,"['Hoppe, E', 'Pauly, M', 'Robbins, M', 'Gray, M', 'Kujirakwinja, D', 'Nishuli, R', 'Mungu-Akonkwa, DDB', 'Leendertz, FH', 'Ehlers, B']",JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY,10.1099/jgv.0.000250,SEP 2015,0,"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) of species Human mastadenovirus B (HAdV-B) are genetically highly diverse and comprise several pathogenic types. AdVs closely related to members of HAdV-B infect African great apes and the evolutionary origin of HAdV-B has recently been determined in ancient gorillas. Genetic evidence for intra- and inter-species recombination has been obtained for Ad Vs of humans and captive great apes, but evidence from wild great apes is lacking. In this study, potential HAdV-B members of wild Eastern gorillas were analysed for evidence of recombination. One near-complete genome was amplified from primary sample material and sequenced, and from another six individuals genome fragments were obtained. In phylogenomic analysis, their penton base, pVII-pVI, hexon and fiber genes were compared with those of all publicly available HAdV-B full-genome sequences of humans and captive great apes. Evidence for intra-species recombination between different HAdV-B members of wild gorillas as well as between HAdV-B members of chimpanzees and gorillas was obtained. Since zoonotic Ad Vs have been reported. to cause respiratory outbreaks in both humans and monkeys, and humans in West and Central Africa frequently hunt and butcher primates thereby increasing the chance of zoonotic transmission, such HAdV-B recombinants might widen the pool of potential human pathogens."
Screening Wild and Semi-Free Ranging Great Apes for Putative Sexually Transmitted Diseases: Evidence of Trichomonadidae Infections,"['Rushmore, J', 'Allison, AB', 'Edwards, EE', 'Bagal, U', 'Altizer, S', 'Cranfield, MR', 'Glenn, TC', 'Liu, H', 'Mudakikwa, A', 'Mugisha, L', 'Muller, MN', 'Stumpf, RM', 'Thompson, ME', 'Wrangham, R', 'Yabsley, MJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22442,OCT 2015,0,"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can persist endemically, are known to cause sterility and infant mortality in humans, and could have similar impacts in wildlife populations. African apes (i.e., chimpanzees, bonobos, and to a lesser extent gorillas) show multi-male mating behavior that could offer opportunities for STD transmission, yet little is known about the prevalence and impact of STDs in this endangered primate group. We used serology and PCR-based detection methods to screen biological samples from wild and orphaned eastern chimpanzees and gorillas (N = 172 individuals, including adults, and juveniles) for four classes of pathogens that either commonly cause human STDs or were previously detected in captive apes: trichomonads, Chlamydia spp., Treponema pallidum (syphilis and yaws), and papillomaviruses. Based on results from prior modeling and comparative research, we expected STD prevalence to be highest in females versus males and in sexually mature versus immature individuals. All samples were negative for Chlamydia, Treponema pallidum, and papillomaviruses; however, a high percentage of wild chimpanzee urine and fecal samples showed evidence of trichomonads (protozoa). Analysis revealed that females were more likely than males to have positive urine-but not fecal-samples; however, there was no evidence of age (sexual maturity) differences in infection status. Sequence analysis of chimpanzee trichomonad samples revealed a close relationship to previously described trichomonads within the genus Tetratrichomonas. Phylogenetic comparisons to archived sequences from multiple vertebrate hosts suggests that many of the chimpanzee parasites from our study are likely transmitted via fecal-oral contact, but the transmission of some Tetratrichomonas sequence-types remains unknown and could include sexual contact. Our work emphasizes that only a fraction of infectious agents affecting wild apes are presently known to science, and that further work on great ape STDs could offer insights for the management of endangered great apes and for understanding human STD origins.

Locating Chimpanzee Nests and Identifying Fruiting Trees With an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"['Van Andel, AC', 'Wich, SA', 'Boesch, C', 'Koh, LP', 'Robbins, MM', 'Kelly, J', 'Kuehl, HS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22446,OCT 2015,0,"Monitoring of animal populations is essential for conservation management. Various techniques are available to assess spatiotemporal patterns of species distribution and abundance. Nest surveys are often used for monitoring great apes. Quickly developing technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to complement these ground-based surveys, especially for covering large areas rapidly. Aerial surveys have been used successfully to detect the nests of orang-utans. It is unknown if such an approach is practical for African apes, which usually build their nests at lower heights, where they might be obscured by forest canopy. In this 2-month study, UAV-derived aerial imagery was used for two distinct purposes: testing the detectability of chimpanzee nests and identifying fruiting trees used by chimpanzees in Loango National Park (Gabon). Chimpanzee nest data were collected through two approaches: we located nests on the ground and then tried to detect them in UAV photos and vice versa. Ground surveys were conducted using line transects, reconnaissance trails, and opportunistic sampling during which we detected 116 individual nests in 28 nest groups. In complementary UAV images we detected 48% of the individual nests (68% of nest groups) in open coastal forests and 8% of individual nests (33% of nest groups) in closed canopy inland forests. The key factor for nest detectability in UAV imagery was canopy openness. Data on fruiting trees were collected from five line transects. In 122 UAV images 14 species of trees (N = 433) were identified, alongside 37 tree species (N = 205) in complementary ground surveys. Relative abundance of common tree species correlated between ground and UAV surveys. We conclude that UAVs have great potential as a rapid assessment tool for detecting chimpanzee presence in forest with open canopy and assessing fruit tree availability. UAVs may have limited applicability for nest detection in closed canopy forest. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Mirror self-recognition: a review and critique of attempts to promote and engineer self-recognition in primates,"['Anderson, JR', 'Gallup, GG']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-015-0488-9,OCT 2015,1,"We review research on reactions to mirrors and self-recognition in nonhuman primates, focusing on methodological issues. Starting with the initial demonstration in chimpanzees in 1970 and subsequent attempts to extend this to other species, self-recognition in great apes is discussed with emphasis on spontaneous manifestations of mirror-guided self-exploration as well as spontaneous use of the mirror to investigate foreign marks on otherwise nonvisible body parts-the mark test. Attempts to show self-recognition in other primates are examined with particular reference to the lack of convincing examples of spontaneous mirror-guided self-exploration, and efforts to engineer positive mark test responses by modifying the test or using conditioning techniques. Despite intensive efforts to demonstrate self-recognition in other primates, we conclude that to date there is no compelling evidence that prosimians, monkeys, or lesser apes-gibbons and siamangs-are capable of mirror self-recognition."
"Bonobo habituation in a forest-savanna mosaic habitat: influence of ape species, habitat type, and sociocultural context","['Narat, V', 'Pennec, F', 'Simmen, B', 'Ngawolo, JCB', 'Krief, S']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-015-0476-0,OCT 2015,1,"Habituation is the term used to describe acceptance by wild animals of a human observer as a neutral element in their environment. Among primates, the process takes from a few days for Galago spp. to several years for African apes. There are also intraspecies differences reflecting differences in habitat, home range, and ape-human relationship history. Here, we present the first study of the process of bonobo habituation in a fragmented habitat, a forest-savanna mosaic in the community-based conservation area led by the Congolese nongovernmental organization Mbou-Mon-Tour, Democratic Republic of the Congo. In this area, local people use the forest almost every day for traditional activities but avoid bonobos because of a traditional taboo. Because very few flight reactions were observed during habituation, we focused on quantitative parameters to assess the development of ape tolerance and of the tracking efficiency of observer teams. During the 18-month study period (May 2012-October 2013), 4043 h (319 days) were spent in the forest and bonobos were observed for a total of 405 h (196 contacts on 134 days). The average contact duration was stable over time (124 min), but the minimal distance during a contact decreased with habituation effort. Moreover, bonobo location and tracking efficiency, daily ratio of contact time to habituation effort, and the number of observations at ground level were positively correlated with habituation effort. Our observations suggest that bonobos become habituated relatively rapidly. These results are discussed in relation to the habitat type, ape species, and the local sociocultural context of villagers. The habituation process involves changes in ape behavior toward observers and also more complex interactions concerning the ecosystem, including the building of an efficient local team. Before starting a habituation process, knowledge of the human sociocultural context is essential to assess the balance between risks and benefits."
Evolutionary Characterization of the Retinitis Pigmentosa GTPase Regulator Gene,"['Raghupathy, RK', 'Gautier, P', 'Soares, DC', 'Wright, AF', 'Shu, XH']",INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE,10.1167/iovs.15-17726,OCT 2015,0,"PURPOSE. The evolutionary conservation of the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) gene was examined across vertebrate and invertebrate lineages to elucidate its function.

METHODS. Orthologous RPGR sequences from vertebrates and invertebrates were selected. Multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic analyses, synteny, and gene structure comparisons were carried out. Expression of the alternatively spliced constitutive (RPGR(const) or RPGR(ex1-19)) and RPGR(ORF15) isoforms was examined in developing and adult zebrafish.

RESULTS. Phylogenetic analyses and syntenic relationships were consistent with the selected sequences being true orthologues, although whole genome duplications in teleost fish resulted in a more complex picture. The splice form RPGR(const) was present in all vertebrate and invertebrate species but the defining carboxyl (C)-terminal exon of RPGR(ORF15) was absent from all invertebrates. The regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1)-like domain adopts a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, which was present in both major splice forms and strongly conserved across evolution. The repetitive acidic region of RPGR(ORF15) showed a high rate of in-frame deletions/insertions across nine primate species, compared with flanking sequences, consistent with an unstable and rapidly evolving region. In zebrafish, RPGR(const) transcripts were most strongly expressed in early development, while the RPGR(ORF15) isoform showed highest expression in adult eye.

CONCLUSIONS. The regulator of chromosome condensation 1-like domain of RPGR was conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates, but RPGR(ORF15) was unique to vertebrates, consistent with a proposed role in the ciliary-based transport of cargoes such as rhodopsin, which is similar to 10 times more abundant in vertebrate than invertebrate photoreceptors. The repetitive acidic region of RPGR(ORF15) shows a rapid rate of evolution, consistent with a mutation ""hot spot."""
Premolar root and canal variation in extant non-human hominoidea,"['Moore, NC', 'Hublin, JJ', 'Skinner, MM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22776,OCT 2015,0,"ObjectivesThe premolar sub-cervical region in four non-human extant ape genera are examined to: 1) define a classification scheme for the premolar root system in order to rigorously characterize, quantify and document variation in root and canal, form, number and configuration; 2) compare this variation within and between genera; and 3) test the hypotheses that sex and size (i.e., the size/number continuum, Shields, ) of the premolar are determinants of root/canal form and/or number.

Materials and MethodsMicrotomography and 3D visualization software are utilized to examine a large sample of Hylobates, Pan, Gorilla, and Pongo (n=951 teeth). Each premolar root system is examined to ascertain the expected level of variability for each taxon. Cervical surface area (mm(2)) serves as a metric proxy for tooth size. A Chi-square test of independence is used to assess for variability differences between and within each taxon, and Mann-Whitney U tests are employed to assess the predicted relationship between tooth size and variation within each taxon.

ResultsOur findings indicate that root and canal configurations, non-metric root traits and tooth size can distinguish between extant ape genera. Within the four ape taxa, premolar size variation is generally, but not always, correlated with canal/root number. Our results indicate that males and females within genera differ in tooth size but not in canal/root form and number.

DiscussionWe report previously undocumented variation in the study taxa. Our results are discussed within the context of Miocene Apes as well as the developmental and systematic implications. Am J Phys Anthropol 158:209-226, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Clavicular curvature and locomotion in anthropoid primates: A 3D geometric morphometric analysis,"['Squyres, N', 'DeLeon, VB']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22785,OCT 2015,0,"Objectives:As a component of the primate shoulder, the clavicle is expected to reflect locomotor adaptations. Whereas previous work has generally focused on clavicular length and torsion, the shape of clavicular curvature may better distinguish taxa and provide additional information about upper limb use in locomotion. This study uses three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to analyze shape differences in the curvatures of the clavicle in different locomotor groups of anthropoid primates.

Methods:Sliding semi-landmarks were placed on clavicles of 10 Anthropoid primate species (total n=85) that display a range of locomotor behaviors. Landmarks (k=39) were chosen to capture the overall curvature of the clavicle in three dimensions.

Results:The degree of ventral curvature in the clavicle represents a gradient from most-curved in suspensory genera (e.g., Ateles, Hylobates, and Pongo) to least-curved in genera that are rarely suspensory (e.g., Papio and Gorilla). This curvature may allow an increased range of craniodorsal movement without the clavicle impinging on the thoracic outlet. An inferior curvature of the medial clavicle is found in hominoids and brachiators. This curvature could help stabilize the shoulder and prevent superior dislocation of the clavicle in suspension. Finally, a superior curvature in the lateral part of the clavicle, most pronounced in quadrupedal monkeys, may be related to the relative position of the scapula and sternum.

Conclusions:Patterns of clavicular curvature in anthropoid primates reflect locomotor behavior and successfully distinguished among taxonomic and locomotor groups. In the future, this method could be used to assess locomotor behavior in fossil primates. Am J Phys Anthropol 158:257-268, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
The interplay between DNA methylation and sequence divergence in recent human evolution,"['Hernando-Herraez, I', 'Heyn, H', 'Fernandez-Callejo, M', 'Vidal, E', 'Fernandez-Bellon, H', 'Prado-Martinez, J', 'Sharp, AJ', 'Esteller, M', 'Marques-Bonet, T']",NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH,10.1093/nar/gkv693,SEP 30 2015,0,"Despite the increasing knowledge about DNA methylation, the understanding of human epigenome evolution is in its infancy. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing we identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in humans compared to non-human primates and estimated that similar to 25% of these regions were detectable throughout several human tissues. Human DMRs were enriched for specific histone modifications and the majority were located distal to transcription start sites, highlighting the importance of regions outside the direct regulatory context. We also found a significant excess of endogenous retrovirus elements in human-specific hypomethylated.

We reported for the first time a close interplay between inter-species genetic and epigenetic variation in regions of incomplete lineage sorting, transcription factor binding sites and human differentially hypermethylated regions. Specifically, we observed an excess of human-specific substitutions in transcription factor binding sites located within human DMRs, suggesting that alteration of regulatory motifs underlies some human-specific methylation patterns. We also found that the acquisition of DNA hypermethylation in the human lineage is frequently coupled with a rapid evolution at nucleotide level in the neighborhood of these CpG sites. Taken together, our results reveal new insights into the mechanistic basis of human-specific DNA methylation patterns and the interpretation of inter-species non-coding variation."
Grandmothering life histories and human pair bonding,"['Coxworth, JE', 'Kim, PS', 'McQueen, JS', 'Hawkes, K']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1599993112,SEP 22 2015,1,"The evolution of distinctively human life history and social organization is generally attributed to paternal provisioning based on pair bonds. Here we develop an alternative argument that connects the evolution of human pair bonds to the male-biased mating sex ratios that accompanied the evolution of human life history. We simulate an agent-based model of the grandmother hypothesis, compare simulated sex ratios to data on great apes and human hunter-gatherers, and note associations between a preponderance of males and mate guarding across taxa. Then we explore a recent model that highlights the importance of mating sex ratios for differences between birds and mammals and conclude that lessons for human evolution cannot ignore mammalian reproductive constraints. In contradiction to our claim that male-biased sex ratios are characteristically human, female-biased ratios are reported in some populations. We consider the likelihood that fertile men are undercounted and conclude that the mate-guarding hypothesis for human pair bonds gains strength from explicit links with our grandmothering life history."
Organization and evolution of Gorilla centromeric DNA from old strategies to new approaches,"['Catacchio, CR', 'Ragone, R', 'Chiatante, G', 'Ventura, M']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,10.1038/srep14189,SEP 21 2015,0,"The centromere/kinetochore interaction is responsible for the pairing and segregation of replicated chromosomes in eukaryotes. Centromere DNA is portrayed as scarcely conserved, repetitive in nature, quickly evolving and protein-binding competent. Among primates, the major class of centromeric DNA is the pancentromeric alpha-satellite, made of arrays of 171 bp monomers, repeated in a head-to-tail pattern. alpha-satellite sequences can either form tandem heterogeneous monomeric arrays or assemble in higher-order repeats (HORs). Gorilla centromere DNA has barely been characterized, and data are mainly based on hybridizations of human alphoid sequences. We isolated and finely characterized gorilla alpha-satellite sequences and revealed relevant structure and chromosomal distribution similarities with other great apes as well as gorilla-specific features, such as the uniquely octameric structure of the suprachromosomal family-2 (SF2). We demonstrated for the first time the orthologous localization of alphoid suprachromosomal families-1 and - 2 (SF1 and SF2) between human and gorilla in contrast to chimpanzee centromeres. Finally, the discovery of a new 189 bp monomer type in gorilla centromeres unravels clues to the role of the centromere protein B, paving the way to solve the significance of the centromere DNA's essential repetitive nature in association with its function and the peculiar evolution of the alpha-satellite sequence."

In addition, a putative novel gastric Helicobacter species was identified in wild gorillas and chimpanzees, for which the name ""Candidatus H. homininae"" was proposed. A high incidence of gastric non-H. pylori Helicobacter infection was described in China and multiple case reports have described the involvement of enterohepatic Helicobacter species, especially Helicobacter cinaedi, in a wide range of diseases. Several studies in rodent models further elucidated the mechanisms underlying the development of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma during infection with gastric non-H. pylori Helicobacters. The effects of infection with gastric Helicobacters on the development of neuroinflammation were investigated and several enterohepatic Helicobacter species were shown to affect the composition of the gut microbiota, to influence vaccine efficiency as well as the progression of cancer in distant sites of the body."
Species specificities among primates probed with commercially available fluorescence-based multiplex PCR typing kits,"['Hiroshige, Y', 'Ohtaki, H', 'Yoshimoto, T', 'Ogawa, H', 'Ishii, A', 'Yamamoto, T']",LEGAL MEDICINE,10.1016/j.legalmed.2015.03.006,SEP 2015,0,"To assess species specificities among primates of signals from short tandem repeat (STR) loci included in two commercially available kits, mainly the AmpFlSTR Identifiler kit and additionally the GenePrint PowerPlex 16 system, we analyzed 69 DNA samples from 22 nonhuman primate species representing apes, Old World Monkeys (OWMs), New World Monkeys (NWMs), and prosimians. Each prosimian species and the NWM cotton-top tamarin apparently lacked all STR loci probed. Only one peak, the amelogenin-X peak, was evident in samples from all other NWMs, except the owl monkey. In contrast, several loci, including the amelogenin-X peak, was evident in samples from each OWM species. Notably, for each ape sample, the amelogenin peaks were concordant with morphological gender of the individual. Among the primates, especially in apes, the numbers of alleles for STR loci were increasing according to their phylogenetic order: prosimians < NWMs < OWNs < apes, and so among apes: agile gibbons < white handed gibbons < orangutans < gorillas/common chimpanzees/bonobos. The species specificities among primates for a few commercially released multiplex STR kits examined in this study would contribute to forensic examinations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, the animals involved in seed predation and dispersal of Dacryodes normandii (Burseraceae), an endozoochorously dispersed tree species endemic to Gabonese forests, were identified in a site in south-east Gabon using two complementary methods: direct observation and camera-trap monitoring of fruit piles. The combined sampling effort (172 h of direct observations and 796 d of camera trapping) led to the identification of six disperser and eight predator species of D. normandii seeds. With high frequency of consumption (88% and 57% of their visits, respectively) and long visit duration (83 and 23 min, respectively), the western lowland gorilla and central chimpanzee were identified as the main dispersers of this species. Seeds passed through the gorilla gut exhibited high germination success (68%). Rodents were identified as predators of D. normandii seeds, potentially displaying rare secondary dispersal through scatter-hoarding. The results of this study highlight the importance of great apes in the seed dispersal of this tree species."
Perception of available space during chimpanzee introductions: Number of accessible areas is more important than enclosure size,"['Herrelko, ES', 'Buchanan-Smith, HM', 'Vick, SJ']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21234,SEP-OCT 2015,0,"Restricting animals to different areas of their enclosure, for both brief and extended durations, is a key element of animal management practices. With such restrictions, available space decreases and the choices the animals can make are more limited, particularly in relation to social dynamics. When unfamiliar individuals are introduced to each other, group dynamics can be unpredictable and understanding space usage is important to facilitate successful introductions. We studied the behavioral, welfare-related responses of two groups of zoo-housed chimpanzees (n=22) as they were introduced to each other and experienced a variety of enclosure restrictions and group composition changes. Our analysis of available space while controlling for chimpanzee density, found that arousal-related scratching and yawning decreased as the number of enclosure areas (separate rooms) available increased, whereas only yawning decreased as the amount of available space (m(2)) increased. Allogrooming, rubbing, and regurgitation/reingestion rates remained constant as both the number of enclosure areas and amount of space changed. Enclosure space is important to zoo-housed chimpanzees, but during introductions, a decrease in arousal-related scratching indicates that the number of accessible areas is more important than the total amount of space available, suggesting that it is important to provide modular enclosures that provide choice and flexible usage, to minimize the welfare impact of short- and long-term husbandry needs.

High Rate of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) Infections in Wild Chimpanzees in Northeastern Gabon,"['Boue, V', 'Locatelli, S', 'Boucher, F', 'Ayouba, A', 'Butel, C', 'Esteban, A', 'Okouga, AP', 'Ndoungouet, A', 'Motsch, P', 'Le Flohic, G', 'Ngari, P', 'Prugnolle, F', 'Ollomo, B', 'Rouet, F', 'Liegeois, F']",VIRUSES-BASEL,10.3390/v7092855,SEP 2015,0,"The emergence of HIV-1 groups M, N, O, and P is the result of four independent cross-species transmissions between chimpanzees (cpz) and gorillas (gor) from central/south Cameroon and humans respectively. Although the first two SIVcpz were identified in wild-born captive chimpanzees in Gabon in 1989, no study has been conducted so far in wild chimpanzees in Gabon. To document the SIVcpz infection rate, genetic diversity, and routes of virus transmission, we analyzed 1458 faecal samples collected in 16 different locations across the country, and we conducted follow-up missions in two of them. We found 380 SIV antibody positive samples in 6 different locations in the north and northeast. We determined the number of individuals collected by microsatellite analysis and obtained an adjusted SIV prevalence of 39.45%. We performed parental analysis to investigate viral spread between and within communities and found that SIVs were epidemiologically linked and were transmitted by both horizontal and vertical routes. We amplified pol and gp41 fragments and obtained 57 new SIVcpzPtt strains from three sites. All strains, but one, clustered together within a specific phylogeographic clade. Given that these SIV positive samples have been collected nearby villages and that humans continue to encroach in ape's territories, the emergence of a new HIV in this area needs to be considered."
Positive selection underlies the species-specific binding of Plasmodium falciparum RH5 to human basigin,"['Forni, D', 'Pontremoli, C', 'Cagliani, R', 'Pozzoli, U', 'Clerici, M', 'Sironi, M']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1111/mec.13354,SEP 2015,0,"Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the deadliest form of malaria, is a member of the Laverania subgenus, which includes ape-infecting parasites. P. falciparum is thought to have originated in gorillas, although infection is now restricted to humans. Laverania parasites display remarkable host-specificity, which is partially mediated by the interaction between parasite ligands and host receptors. We analyse the evolution of BSG (basigin) and GYPA (glycophorin A) in primates/hominins, as well as of their Plasmodium-encoded ligands, PfRH5 and PfEBA175. We show that, in primates, positive selection targeted two sites in BSG (F27 and H102), both involved in PfRH5 binding. A population genetics-phylogenetics approach detected the strongest selection for the gorilla lineage: one of the positively selected sites (K191) is a major determinant of PfRH5 binding affinity. Analysis of RH5 genes indicated episodic selection on the P. falciparum branch; the positively selected W447 site is known to stabilize the interaction with human basigin. Conversely, we detect no selection in the receptor-binding region of EBA175 in the P. falciparum lineage. Its host receptor, GYPA, shows evidence of positive selection in all hominid lineages; selected codons include glycosylation sites that modulate PfEBA175 binding affinity. Data herein provide an evolutionary explanation for species-specific binding of the PfRH5-BSG ligand-receptor pair and support the hypothesis that positive selection at these genes drove the host shift leading to the emergence of P. falciparum as a human pathogen."
Personality in Bonobos,"['Weiss, A', 'Staes, N', 'Pereboom, JJM', 'Inoue-Murayama, M', 'Stevens, JMG', 'Eens, M']",PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE,10.1177/0956797615589933,SEP 2015,0,"To better understand human and chimpanzee personality evolution, we obtained trait ratings of personality for 154 captive bonobos (similar to 80% of the U.S. and European population). We found factors that we labeled Assertiveness, Conscientiousness, Openness, Agreeableness, Attentiveness, and Extraversion. The interrater reliabilities and test-retest reliabilities for these factors were comparable to those found in humans and other species. Using orthogonal targeted Procrustes rotations, we compared the bonobo dimensions with those of three samples of captive chimpanzees. Overall congruence coefficients indicated a fair degree of similarity; at the factor level, there was good evidence for Assertiveness, Conscientiousness, Openness, and Agreeableness in the chimpanzee samples; evidence for Attentiveness and Extraversion was poor. These findings suggest that, as expected given their close phylogenetic relationship, bonobo personality structure resembles chimpanzee personality structure in some respects. However, divergent evolution, perhaps as a result of socioecological differences between bonobos and chimpanzees, also appears to have shaped personality structure in these species."
Intestinal Flora Modification of Arthritis Pattern in Spondyloarthropathy,"['Rothschild, BM']",JCR-JOURNAL OF CLINICAL RHEUMATOLOGY,10.1097/RHU.0000000000000279,SEP 2015,0,"Background The reactive form of spondyloarthropathy appears inducible by exposure to agents of infectious diarrhea, but do those organisms represent the tip of the iceberg, as indicated by renewed interest in gastrointestinal flora? Prevalence of spondyloarthropathy (20% of chimpanzees [Pan] and 28% of gorillas) is independent of subspecies and species, respectively. However, there are major differences in arthritis patterns, a characteristic shared with humans.

Objectives Do patterns of arthritis correlate with gastrointestinal flora? Could such associated modifications be in the form of disease induction or represent protective effectors (at least against the extent of peripheral arthritis)?

Methods The skeletons of 2 chimpanzee subspecies (79 Pan troglodytes troglodytes and 26 Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) and 2 gorilla species (99 Gorilla gorilla and 38 Gorilla beringei) adults were examined, and arthritis pattern noted. Feces of Eastern (P. schweinfurthii and G. beringei) and Western (great apes collected in their normal ranges) apes were assessed for 16S rRNA c and its character.

Results Patterns of arthritis recognized on examination of skeletons showed geographic variation in skeletal distribution. East African apes (P. troglodytes schweinfurthii and G. beringei) had pauciarticular arthritis and frequent sacroiliac disease, whereas West African apes (P. troglodytes troglodytes and G. gorilla) had polyarticular peripheral joint disease with minimal sacroiliac involvement. DNA evidence revealed that Corynebactericeae were prominently represented in great apes with polyarticular disease, whereas Dietzia and Bifidobacterium exposure correlated with reduced peripheral joint arthritis distribution.

Conclusions Suggestions of a protective effect (in this case, limiting extent of peripheral arthritis, but not the disease itself) offered by these organisms are well represented by documented effects in other diseases (eg, tuberculosis) in the zoologic record. Perhaps it is this disease-modifying character that reduces the extent of the peripheral erosive disease, while increasing propensity to axial (sacroiliac) disease. A potential role for probiotic organisms in management of arthritis in humans is suggested, as has been documented for tuberculosis, gastrointestinal disorders, and food allergies."
Feeding Ecology of Bonobos Living in Forest-Savannah Mosaics: Diet Seasonal Variation and Importance of Fallback Foods,"['Serckx, A', 'Kuhl, HS', 'Beudels-Jamar, RC', 'Poncin, P', 'Bastin, JF', 'Huynen, MC']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22425,SEP 2015,0,"Primates along with many other animal taxa are forced to cope with large shifts in basic ecological conditions because of rapid anthropogenically induced changes of their habitats. One of the coping strategies for primates is to adjust their diet to these changes, and several studies have demonstrated the importance of fallback resources for this. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, might be particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation because of their high dependence on fruit availability. Little is known, however, about bonobo feeding ecology in fragmented habitats and their use of fallback resources. In this study, we investigate diet seasonal variation and the exploitation of preferred and fallback foods in a bonobo population living in forest-savannah mosaics. Results show that bonobos have adapted to this fragmented habitat by feeding on only a few fruit species, including an important number of non-tree species ( liana, herb and savannah shrub), in comparison to populations living in dense forests. These non-tree plants have been defined as fallback and non-preferred foods, which are most probably consumed to maintain high frugivory. Interestingly, we identified that preferred foods are all typical of mature forests while fallback resources are mainly found in forest edges or disturbed areas. This finding indicates that bonobos prefer to use mature forests when feeding, as they do for nesting, but extend their range use to forest areas in close proximity to humans when the availability of preferred fruits is low. Finally, we show that bonobo diet relies heavily on two abundant fallback fruits: Musanga cecropioides and Marantochloa leucantha. Other studies have demonstrated that the selection of abundant fallback resources enables primates to subsist at high densities and to maintain cohesive groups, as observed at this study site. Our findings suggest that bonobos living in forest-savannah mosaics can be considered as staple fallback food consumers. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
The Geographic Distribution of Genetic Diversity within Gorillas,"['Funfstuck, T', 'Vigilant, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22427,SEP 2015,1,"Gorillas, like all non-human great apes, are endangered. Understanding the distribution of genetic diversity across their range is important because low diversity may arise in small populations through increased inbreeding, and, by reducing reproductive fitness, may lead to decreased chances of persistence of a given population. Previous studies found higher genetic diversity in the western (Gorilla gorilla) than in the eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei), but rarely employed individuals of known geographic origin to investigate the distribution of diversity across multiple populations. The present study fills that gap by analyzing 1,161 individuals from nine sites across all four currently recognized Gorilla subspecies. Genetic diversity at each site was estimated using published data from seven highly-variable microsatellite loci. We found that the small and fragmented populations of Cross River gorillas, eastern lowland gorillas and mountain gorillas were less diverse than any of the five analyzed western lowland gorilla populations. The higher levels of genetic variation within the western lowland gorillas might be best explained by the facts that they (i) exhibit larger present and past effective population sizes than the other subspecies and (ii) maintain higher rates of gene flow through the existence of largely continuous habitat within their range. With regard to conservation, the high genetic diversity within western lowland gorillas is encouraging and retention of dispersal corridors between already protected areas is essential.

"Effects of Changing Housing Conditions on Mangabey Behavior (Cercocebus atys): Spatial Density, Housing Quality, and Novelty Effects","['Crast, J', 'Bloomsmith, MA', 'Jonesteller, T']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22430,SEP 2015,0,"The separate influences of spatial density and housing quality on the behavior of captive animals are difficult to measure because the two factors are often intrinsically linked. Here, we recorded affiliative and agonistic behavior in adult sooty mangabeys in various housing situations, testing spatial density and housing quality changes separately (N = 26 experienced spatial density changes; N = 12 experienced housing quality changes). We varied spatial density by 50% while holding housing quality constant and we varied housing quality while holding spatial density constant (achieved by comparing two types of run-housing that varied in the amount of visual privacy and outdoor access). Each housing condition was one month in duration. Prior to collecting data in each housing condition, we evaluated the subjects' initial responses to the change in housing environment during 2-week novelty periods. Affiliative behavior did not change during the novelty periods. Agonistic behavior initially increased slightly when spatial density increased and it decreased significantly when spatial density decreased; it also decreased when subjects moved to housing that offered more visual privacy and outdoor space, indicating that the mangabeys were sensitive to these housing changes. After the novelty periods, affiliative behavior increased under higher spatial density, but remained unchanged across housing quality conditions; agonistic behavior remained unchanged across all conditions. Results suggest that a prolonged increase in spatial density led the mangabeys to adopt a tension-reduction coping strategy, in which the increase in affiliative behavior alleviates a presumed increase in social tension. Reducing visual privacy and choice did not affect the mangabeys' behavior, post-novelty period. Thus, like many other primates, the mangabeys managed tension by flexibly adapting to changes in their housing environment in ways that reduce the risk of severe aggression. This study highlights the importance of controlled behavioral studies in facilitating data-driven management decisions that promote animal welfare. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
"Estimation of Chimpanzee Community Size and Genetic Diversity in Kahuzi-Biega National Park, Democratic Republic of Congo","['Basabose, AK', 'Inoue, E', 'Kamungu, S', 'Murhabale, B', 'Akomo-Okoue, EF', 'Yamagiwa, J', 'GRAUERS GORILLAS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22435,SEP 2015,0,"A small chimpanzee habitat in the montane forest of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, Democratic Republic of Congo, is connected with the lowland forest of this park through a corridor, which is affected by human encroachment. To assess the conservation status of the chimpanzee population in this small habitat, we estimated the size of the community and evaluated its genetic diversity by using 279 fecal samples collected in the montane forest of Kahuzi. Using autosomal microsatellite (or short tandem repeat, STR) loci, we identified 32 individuals, comprising 19 females and 13 males. Samples from 24 individuals were collected at least twice and a genetic mark-recapture analysis estimated that the community size was 36 (range: 32-42). Data on nest site sharing confirmed that all the samples belonged to the same community. Nest site sharing information may be useful in population studies of unhabituated chimpanzees. The genetic structure and diversity of the 32 genotyped individuals was assessed using Y-chromosomal short tandem repeat (Y-STR) loci and mitochondrial D-loops. One dominant Y-STR haplotype was found, whereas there was no dominant haplotype in the mitochondrial region, reflecting a female-biased dispersal pattern, which is typical of chimpanzees. The genetic diversity for three markers in Kahuzi chimpanzees was comparable to that in other eastern chimpanzee populations. A relatively high heterozygosity and negative inbreeding coefficient (FIS) for STR loci suggests that the study community belongs to an outbreeding chimpanzee population. These findings suggest that individuals of the study community may have reproductive contact with other chimpanzee individuals from neighboring communities in Kahuzi-Biega National Park, at least in the recent past.

The learning of action sequences through social transmission,"['Whalen, A', 'Cownden, D', 'Laland, K']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-015-0877-x,SEP 2015,1,"Previous empirical work on animal social learning has found that many species lack the ability to learn entire action sequences solely through reliance on social information. Conversely, acquiring action sequences through asocial learning can be difficult due to the large number of potential sequences arising from even a small number of base actions. In spite of this, several studies report that some primates use action sequences in the wild. We investigate how social information can be integrated with asocial learning to facilitate the learning of action sequences. We formalize this problem by examining how learners using temporal difference learning, a widely applicable model of reinforcement learning, can combine social cues with their own experiences to acquire action sequences. The learning problem is modeled as a Markov decision process. The learning of nettle processing by mountain gorillas serves as a focal example. Through simulations, we find that the social facilitation of component actions can combine with individual learning to facilitate the acquisition of action sequences. Our analysis illustrates that how even simple forms of social learning, combined with asocial learning, generate substantially faster learning of action sequences compared to asocial processes alone, and that the benefits of social information increase with the length of the action sequence and the number of base actions."
Quantification acuity in spontaneous shoaling decisions of three-spined sticklebacks,"['Mehlis, M', 'Thunken, T', 'Bakker, T', 'Frommen, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-015-0884-y,SEP 2015,1,"The ability to discriminate between different quantities is widespread throughout the animal kingdom, and the underlying mechanisms of quantity discrimination are currently intensely discussed. In contrast, questions elucidating the limits of quantity estimation received rather little attention so far. Here, we examined fine-tuned quantity estimation in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in a natural context, i.e. during shoaling decisions. Wild-caught focal fish were given the spontaneous choice between two shoals which differed in group size by 1 fish (0 vs. 1, 1 vs. 2, 2 vs. 3, 3 vs. 4, 4 vs. 5, 5 vs. 6 and 6 vs. 7), based on visual assessment. The results show that sticklebacks generally prefer to shoal with the larger group. They discriminated numerical contrasts up to 6 versus 7, equalling a numerical ratio of 0.86. Preference patterns followed Weber's law, i.e. decreased with increasing numerical ratio. This pattern was found across all numerical conditions as well as within the small number range (ranging from 1 vs. 2 to 3 vs. 4). The results suggest that wild-caught three-spined sticklebacks are spontaneously able (i.e. without prior learning) to detect subtle differences in shoal sizes. Further, they confirm findings of previous studies highlighting the contribution of the analogue magnitude system to quantity estimation in fishes."
"Learned vocal and breathing behavior in an enculturated gorilla
","['Perlman, M', 'Clark, N']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-015-0889-6,SEP 2015,1,"We describe the repertoire of learned vocal and breathing-related behaviors (VBBs) performed by the enculturated gorilla Koko. We examined a large video corpus of Koko and observed 439 VBBs spread across 161 bouts. Our analysis shows that Koko exercises voluntary control over the performance of nine distinctive VBBs, which involve variable coordination of her breathing, larynx, and supralaryngeal articulators like the tongue and lips. Each of these behaviors is performed in the context of particular manual action routines and gestures. Based on these and other findings, we suggest that vocal learning and the ability to exercise volitional control over vocalization, particularly in a multimodal context, might have figured relatively early into the evolution of language, with some rudimentary capacity in place at the time of our last common ancestor with great apes."
Primates' Socio-Cognitive Abilities: What Kind of Comparisons Makes Sense?,"['Byrnit, JT']",INTEGRATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE,10.1007/s12124-015-9312-8,SEP 2015,0,"Referential gestures are of pivotal importance to the human species. We effortlessly make use of each others' referential gestures to attend to the same things, and our ability to use these gestures show themselves from very early in life. Almost 20 years ago, James Anderson and colleagues presented an experimental paradigm with which to examine the use of referential gestures in non-human primates: the object-choice task. Since then, numerous object-choice studies have been made, not only with primates but also with a range of other animal taxa. Surprisingly, several non-primate species appear to perform better in the object-choice task than primates do. Different hypotheses have been offered to explain the results. Some of these have employed generalizations about primates or subsets of primate taxa that do not take into account the unparalleled diversity that exists between species within the primate order on parameters relevant to the requirements of the object-choice task, such as social structure, feeding ecology, and general morphology. To examine whether these broad primate generalizations offer a fruitful organizing framework within which to interpret the results, a review was made of all published primate results on the use of gazing and glancing cues with species ordered along the primate phylogenetic tree. It was concluded that differences between species may be larger than differences between ancestry taxa, and it is suggested that we need to start rethinking why we are testing animals on experimental paradigms that do not take into account what are the challenges of their natural habitat."

Variable nuclear (5.8S-ITS2; 28S rRNA) and mitochondrial genes (cox1; nad1) of isolates of anoplocephalids originating from different primates (Callicebus oenanthe, Gorilla beringei, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes and Pongo abelii) and humans from various regions (South America, Africa, South-East Asia) were sequenced. In most analyses, Bertiella formed a monophyletic group within the subfamily Anoplocephalinae, however, the 28S rRNA sequence-based analysis indicated paraphyletic relationship between Bertiella from primates and Australian marsupials and rodents, which should thus be regarded as different taxa. Moreover, isolate determined as Anoplocephala cf. gorillae from mountain gorilla clustered within the Bertiella clade from primates. This either indicates that A. gorillae deserves to be included into the genus Bertiella, or, that an unknown Bertiella species infects also mountain gorillas. The analyses allowed the genetic differentiation of the isolates, albeit with no obvious geographical or host-related patterns. The unexpected genetic diversity of the isolates studied suggests the existence of several Bertiella species in primates and human and calls for revision of the whole group, based both on molecular and morphological data."
Sonification of in-vehicle interface reduces gaze movements under dual-task condition,"['Tardieu, J', 'Misdariis, N', 'Langlois, S', 'Gaillard, P', 'Lemercier, C']",APPLIED ERGONOMICS,10.1016/j.apergo.2015.02.004,SEP 2015,0,"In-car infotainment systems (ICIS) often degrade driving performances since they divert the driver's gaze from the driving scene. Sonification of hierarchical menus (such as those found in most ICIS) is examined in this paper as one possible solution to reduce gaze movements towards the visual display. In a dual-task experiment in the laboratory, 46 participants were requested to prioritize a primary task (a continuous target detection task) and to simultaneously navigate in a realistic mock-up of an ICIS, either sonified or not. Results indicated that sonification significantly increased the time spent looking at the primary task, and significantly decreased the number and the duration of gaze saccades towards the ICIS. In other words, the sonified ICIS could be used nearly exclusively by ear. On the other hand, the reaction times in the primary task were increased in both silent and sonified conditions. This study suggests that sonification of secondary tasks while driving could improve the driver's visual attention of the driving scene. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Genetic censusing identifies an unexpectedly sizeable population of an endangered large mammal in a fragmented forest landscape,"['McCarthy, MS', 'Lester, JD', 'Howe, EJ', 'Arandjelovic, M', 'Stanford, CB', 'Vigilant, L']",BMC ECOLOGY,10.1186/s12898-015-0052-x,AUG 25 2015,0,"Background: As habitat degradation and fragmentation continue to impact wildlife populations around the world, it is critical to understand the behavioral flexibility of species in these environments. In Uganda, the mostly unprotected forest fragment landscape between the Budongo and Bugoma Forests is a potential corridor for chimpanzees, yet little is known about the status of chimpanzee populations in these fragments.

Results: From 2011 through 2013, we noninvasively collected 865 chimpanzee fecal samples across 633 km2 and successfully genotyped 662 (77%) at up to 14 microsatellite loci. These genotypes corresponded to 182 chimpanzees, with a mean of 3.5 captures per individual. We obtained population size estimates of 256 (95% confidence interval 246-321) and 319 (288-357) chimpanzees using capture-with-replacement and spatially explicit capture-recapture models, respectively. The spatial clustering of associated genotypes suggests the presence of at least nine communities containing a minimum of 8-33 individuals each. Putative community distributions defined by the locations of associated genotypes correspond well with the distribution of 14 Y-chromosome haplotypes.

Conclusions: These census figures are more than three times greater than a previous estimate based on an extrapolation from small-scale nest count surveys that tend to underestimate population size. The distribution of genotype clusters and Y-chromosome haplotypes together indicate the presence of numerous male philopatric chimpanzee communities throughout the corridor habitat. Our findings demonstrate that, despite extensive habitat loss and fragmentation, chimpanzees remain widely distributed and exhibit distinct community home ranges. Our results further imply that elusive and rare species may adapt to degraded habitats more successfully than previously believed. Their long-term persistence is unlikely, however, if protection is not afforded to them and habitat loss continues unabated."
"Np9, a cellular protein of retroviral ancestry restricted to human, chimpanzee and gorilla, binds and regulates ubiquitin ligase MDM2","['Heyne, K', 'Kolsch, K', 'Bruand, M', 'Kremmer, E', 'Grasser, FA', 'Mayer, J', 'Roemer, K']",CELL CYCLE,10.1080/15384101.2015.1064565,AUG 18 2015,0,"Humans and primates are long-lived animals with long reproductive phases. One factor that appears to contribute to longevity and fertility in humans, as well as to cancer-free survival, is the transcription factor and tumor suppressor p53, controlled by its main negative regulator MDM2. However, p53 and MDM2 homologs are found throughout the metazoan kingdom from Trichoplacidae to Hominidae. Therefore the question arises, if p53/MDM2 contributes to the shaping of primate features, then through which mechanisms. Previous findings have indicated that the appearances of novel p53-regulated genes and wild-type p53 variants during primate evolution are important in this context. Here, we report on another mechanism of potential relevance. Human endogenous retrovirus K subgroup HML-2 (HERV-K(HML-2)) type 1 proviral sequences were formed in the genomes of the predecessors of contemporary Hominoidea and can be identified in the genomes of Nomascus leucogenys (gibbon) up to Homo sapiens. We previously reported on an alternative splicing event in HERV-K(HML-2) type 1 proviruses that can give rise to nuclear protein of 9kDa (Np9). We document here the evolution of Np9-coding capacity in human, chimpanzee and gorilla, and show that the C-terminal half of Np9 binds directly to MDM2, through a domain of MDM2 that is known to be contacted by various cellular proteins in response to stress. Np9 can inhibit the MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53 in the cell nucleus, and can support the transactivation of genes by p53. Our findings point to the possibility that endogenous retrovirus protein Np9 contributes to the regulation of the p53-MDM2 pathway specifically in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas."

Nevertheless, MK3 adds a great deal of variability to the genus Homo, at least as far as the Early Pleistocene fossil record is concerned. In particular, our quantitative approach, which combines traditional morphometric analyses and geometric morphometrics, highlights traits that are uncommon among the Plio-Pleistocene fossil record, while affinities with Mid-to-Late Pleistocene representatives of Homo are observed. In addition, the large size of MK3 suggests that this humerus belonged to an individual whose body weight approached 90 kg, far from the range of body size known for Homo representatives in the Early Pleistocene and as big as those of extant humans or even gorillas. We suggest that such peculiar features are of interest when regarded from an ecological perspective; thus, dimension and morphology of win may be considered as an exaptation that became useful when early humans dispersed to high altitudes such as those of the upper Awash basin on the Ethiopian plateau, at heights above 2000 m.

Strong Selective Sweeps on the X Chromosome in the Human-Chimpanzee Ancestor Explain Its Low Divergence,"['Dutheil, JY', 'Munch, K', 'Nam, K', 'Mailund, T', 'Schierup, MH']",PLOS GENETICS,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005451,AUG 2015,2,"The human and chimpanzee X chromosomes are less divergent than expected based on autosomal divergence. We study incomplete lineage sorting patterns between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas to show that this low divergence can be entirely explained by megabase-sized regions comprising one-third of the X chromosome, where polymorphism in the human-chimpanzee ancestral species was severely reduced. We show that background selection can explain at most 10% of this reduction of diversity in the ancestor. Instead, we show that several strong selective sweeps in the ancestral species can explain it. We also report evidence of population specific sweeps in extant humans that overlap the regions of low diversity in the ancestral species. These regions further correspond to chromosomal sections shown to be devoid of Neanderthal introgression into modern humans. This suggests that the same X-linked regions that undergo selective sweeps are among the first to form reproductive barriers between diverging species. We hypothesize that meiotic drive is the underlying mechanism causing these two observations."

Multiple Cross-Species Transmission Events of Human Adenoviruses (HAdV) during Hominine Evolution,"['Hoppe, E', 'Pauly, M', 'Gillespie, TR', 'Akoua-Koffi, C', 'Hohmann, G', 'Fruth, B', 'Karhemere, S', 'Madinda, NF', 'Mugisha, L', 'Muyembe, JJ', 'Todd, A', 'Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Gray, M', 'Robbins, M', 'Bergl, RA', 'Wittig, RM', 'Zuberbuhler, K', 'Boesch, C', 'Schubert, G', 'Leendertz, FH', 'Ehlers, B', 'Calvignac-Spencer, S']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msv090,AUG 2015,3,"Human adenoviruses (HAdV; species HAdV-A to -G) are highly prevalent in the human population, and represent an important cause of morbidity and, to a lesser extent, mortality. Recent studies have identified close relatives of these viruses in African great apes, suggesting that some HAdV may be of zoonotic origin. We analyzed more than 800 fecal samples from wild African great apes and humans to further investigate the evolutionary history and zoonotic potential of hominine HAdV. HAdV-B and -E were frequently detected in wild gorillas (55%) and chimpanzees (25%), respectively. Bayesian ancestral host reconstruction under discrete diffusion models supported a gorilla and chimpanzee origin for these viral species. Host switches were relatively rare along HAdV evolution, with about ten events recorded in 4.5 My. Despite presumably rare direct contact between sympatric populations of the two species, transmission events from gorillas to chimpanzees were observed, suggesting that habitat and dietary overlap may lead to fecal-oral cross-hominine transmission of HAdV. Finally, we determined that two independent HAdV-B transmission events to humans occurred more than 100,000 years ago. We conclude that HAdV-B circulating in humans are of zoonotic origin and have probably affected global human health for most of our species lifetime."
Electrocardiogram reference intervals for clinically normal wild- born chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Atencia, R', 'Revuelta, L', 'Somauroo, JD', 'Shave, RE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH,NA,AUG 2015,0,"OBJECTIVE

To generate reference intervals for ECG variables in clinically normal chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).

ANIMALS

100 clinically normal (51 young [< 10 years old] and 49 adult [>= 10 years old]) wild-born chimpanzees.

PROCEDURES

Electrocardiograms collected between 2009 and 2013 at the Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Centre were assessed to determine heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QRS axis, P axis, and T axis. Electrocardiographic characteristics for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and morphology of the ST segment, T wave, and QRS complex were identified. Reference intervals for young and old animals were calculated as mean +/- 1.96.SD for normally distributed data and as 5th to 95th percentiles for data not normally distributed. Differences between age groups were assessed by use of unpaired Student t tests.

RESULTS

Reference intervals were generated for young and adult wild-born chimpanzees. Most animals had sinus rhythm with small or normal P wave morphology; 24 of 51 (47%) young chimpanzees and 30 of 49 (61%) adult chimpanzees had evidence of LVH as determined on the basis of criteria for humans.

CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE

Cardiac disease has been implicated as the major cause of death in captive chimpanzees. Species-specific ECG reference intervals for chimpanzees may aid in the diagnosis and treatment of animals with, or at risk of developing, heart disease. Chimpanzees with ECG characteristics outside of these intervals should be considered for follow-up assessment and regular cardiac monitoring."
Using the morphology of the hominoid distal fibula to interpret arboreality in Australopithecus afarensis,"['Marchi, D']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.06.002,AUG 2015,0,"The fibula has rarely been considered in anthropological studies. However differences in morphology - and inferred function of the fibula between human and non-human apes have been noted in the past and related to differences in locomotor behavior. Recent studies have pointed out the correlation between diaphyseal rigidity of the fibula and tibia and locomotor behavior in living hominids, and its possible application for inferring early hominin locomotor behavior. The problem with the application of the method proposed in these studies is the extreme rarity of associated early hominin fibula and tibia. Additionally, previous studies investigating morphological traits of fibulotalar articular facets to infer the degree of arboreality in fossil australopiths were often qualitative. In the present study, articular measurements of the distal fibula of living great apes and humans (Pongo, Gorilla, Pan and Homo) are quantified and compared to Australopithecus afarensis distal fibulae. Quantitative analysis is carried out for articular areas and breadths of the fibulotalar articular facets, for the angles formed by the fibulotalar articular facets and the longitudinal axis of the fibula, and for the angle between the proximal fibulotalar articular facet and the subcutaneous triangular area. Results show that the fibula of A. afarensis bears some traits consistent with modern terrestrial bipedalism, like a more laterally facing lateral malleolus, in association with more ape-like traits, like the smaller distal fibulotalar articular facet area and the more inferiorly oriented fibulotalar articular facets, consistent with A. afarensis being a terrestrial hominin adapted for some form of arboreality.

Gorillas with white sclera: A naturally occurring variation in a morphological trait linked to social cognitive functions,"['Mayhew, JA', 'Gomez, JC']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22411,AUG 2015,0,"Human eye morphology is considered unique among the primates in that humans possess larger width/height ratios (WHR), expose a greater amount of visible sclera (SSI; width of exposed eyeball/width of visible iris), and critically, have a white sclera due to a lack of pigmentation. White sclera in humans amplifies gaze direction, whereas the all-dark eyes of apes are hypothesized to conceal gaze from others. This study examines WHR and SSI in humans (N=13) and gorillas (N=85) engaged in direct and averted gazes and introduces a qualitative assessment of sclera color to evaluate variations in sclera pigmentation. The results confirm previous findings that humans possess a larger WHR than gorillas but indicate that humans and gorillas display similar amounts of visible sclera. Additionally, 72% (N=124) of gorilla eyes in this sample deviated from the assumed all-dark eye condition. This questions whether gaze camouflage is the primary function of darkened sclera in non-human primates or whether other functional roles can be ascribed to the sclera, light or dark. We argue that white sclera evolved to amplify direct gazes in humans, which would have played a significant role in the development of ostensive communication, which is communication that both shows something and shows the intention to show something. We conclude that the horizontal elongation of the human eye, rather than sclera color, more reliably distinguishes human from great ape eyes, represented here by gorillas. Am. J.

A cautionary note on fecal sampling and molecular epidemiology in predatory wild great apes,"['De Nys, HM', 'Madinda, NF', 'Merkel, K', 'Robbins, M', 'Boesch, C', 'Leendertz, FH', 'Calvignac-Spencer, S']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22418,AUG 2015,0,"Fecal samples are an important source of information on parasites (viruses, prokaryotes, or eukaryotes) infecting wild great apes. Molecular analysis of fecal samples has already been used for deciphering the origins of major human pathogens such as HIV-1 or Plasmodium falciparum. However, for apes that hunt (chimpanzees and bonobos), detection of parasite nucleic acids may reflect either true infection of the host of interest or ingestion of an infected prey, for example, another non-human primate. To determine the potential magnitude of this issue, we estimated the prevalence of prey DNA in fecal samples obtained from two wild chimpanzee communities. We observed values >15%, which are higher than or close to the fecal detection rates of many great ape parasites. Contamination of fecal samples with parasite DNA from dietary origin may therefore occasionally impact non-invasive epidemiological studies. This problem can be addressed (at least partially) by monitoring the presence of prey DNA. Am. J. Primatol. 77:833-840, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
"Sexual Dimorphism of Endocranial, Facial and Limb Measurements in the Yellow Baboon (Papio cynocephalus)","['Kikuchi, Y', 'Kuraoka, A']",ANATOMIA HISTOLOGIA EMBRYOLOGIA,10.1111/ahe.12136,AUG 2015,0,"The present study focused on the sexual dimorphism of yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus) to clarify its relationship with social behaviour. The degree of sexual dimorphism in the endocranial volume is the lowest among the investigated measurements. Among the facial measurements, the degree value of sexual dimorphism was the maximum (38.4%) for palate length and the minimum for palate breadth at the upper second molar (M2) (16.8%). Reduced major axis (RMA) regression analysis indicated that most positive allometry in relation to body mass was barely shown in the endocranial volume, palate length, palate breadth at M2 and mandibular ramal width. On the other hand, most negative allometry in relation to body mass was barely indicated in the bizygomatic breadth, skull length, humeral length and femoral length. The plate breadth at M2 in males was smaller than that in females in equivalent to body mass. The results of the present study suggest that more males have longer pointed muzzles than females, which is considered to create an impressive view of large canine teeth. This contributes to display among males and agonistic encounters rather than to necessity of increased facial size due to larger body size or dietary influences."
Transposon-mediated death of an ancestral A-23-like allele: evolution of TCR-positioning motifs in the HLA-A lineage,"['Murray, JS']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s00251-015-0852-3,AUG 2015,0,"HLA-A alleles are characterized by tandem arginine and histidine/arginine motifs (i.e., R65 and H151R motifs) present on the alpha 1- and alpha 2-helix, respectively. In crystallographic structures, alpha/beta T-cell receptors (TCR) contact both motifs and appear to be geometrically positioned for alloreactivity. Herein, bioinformatics of ""dual-motif"" MHC A-like alleles were investigated across phylogeny. While A-like alleles with the R65 motif are widespread, the H151R motif has segregated out of most species. Surprisingly, an uncharacterized orf in tarsiers (Loc-103275158) encodes R151 within a truncated A-23-like gene, which is in frame with short footprints of Tc5 and Tigger transposons (TE); the extant tarsier A-23 allele is totally missing exon-3 and part of exon-4; together, suggesting TE-mediated inactivation of an intact/ancestral A-23 allele. Since the only other (non-human) dual-motif A-like alleles are in gorilla, chimpanzee, and the Florida manatee, we speculate that dual-motif A alleles first emerged in the Afrotherian lineage and reappeared during the evolution of higher primates."
Western lowland gorilla seed dispersal: Are seeds adapted to long gut retention times?,"['Petre, CA', 'Tagg, N', 'Beudels-Jamar, RC', 'Haurez, B', 'Doucet, JL', 'DEFAUNATION']",ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,10.1016/j.actao.2015.06.003,AUG 2015,0,"The degree of seed scarification in the frugivore gut, partly dependent on gut retention time, is a key component in determining the extent to which gut passage alters germination performances. Another potential benefit of gut passage arises as a result of the removal of fruit pulp which otherwise may act as a germination inhibitor. Using experiments designed to disentangle the respective effects of pulp removal (germination deinhibition) and seed scarification, and gut retention time as an explanatory variable, we investigated the effect of gut passage on germination performances (percentage and latency) of five tropical tree species dispersed by the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla g. gorilla). The percentage of seeds germinating after gut passage increased for three species, respectively, through the effects of scarification only, deinhibition only, and scarification and deinhibition combined. A negative scarification effect was observed for one species, and no effect of gut passage for another. Passage through the gut led to a decrease in germination latency of three species, as a result of the depulping of seeds. However, seed scarification resulted in germination delays for another species. The gut retention time of the five species averaged 39-56 h and had no effect on intra-specific germination performances except for one species whose germination probability increased as gut retention time increased. As gut retention time often correlates with dispersal distance, the fact that gut retention time per se does not reduce seed viability of these tropical tree species may have positive implications for their population dynamics and maintenance of genetic diversity. If no detrimental effect of gut retention time on germination performance is a general trait among tropical species, the extirpation of large frugivores with long gut retention time, such as the western lowland gorilla, would likely have negative long-term implications for tropical forests.

Human rather than ape-like orbital morphology allows much greater lateral visual field expansion with eye abduction,"['Denion, E', 'Hitier, M', 'Levieil, E', 'Mouriaux, F']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,10.1038/srep12437,JUL 20 2015,1,"While convergent, the human orbit differs from that of non-human apes in that its lateral orbital margin is significantly more rearward. This rearward position does not obstruct the additional visual field gained through eye motion. This additional visual field is therefore considered to be wider in humans than in non-human apes. A mathematical model was designed to quantify this difference. The mathematical model is based on published computed tomography data in the human neuroocular plane (NOP) and on additional anatomical data from 100 human skulls and 120 non-human ape skulls (30 gibbons; 30 chimpanzees / bonobos; 30 orangutans; 30 gorillas). It is used to calculate temporal visual field eccentricity values in the NOP first in the primary position of gaze then for any eyeball rotation value in abduction up to 45 degrees and any lateral orbital margin position between 85 degrees and 115 degrees relative to the sagittal plane. By varying the lateral orbital margin position, the human orbit can be made ""non-human ape-like"". In the Pan-like orbit, the orbital margin position (98.7 degrees) was closest to the human orbit (107.1 degrees). This modest 8.4 degrees difference resulted in a large 21.1 degrees difference in maximum lateral visual field eccentricity with eyeball abduction (Pan-like: 115 degrees; human: 136.1 degrees)."

The Influence of Seasonal Frugivory on Nutrient and Energy Intake in Wild Western Gorillas,"['Masi, S', 'Mundry, R', 'Ortmann, S', 'Cipolletta, C', 'Boitani, L', 'Robbins, MM']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0129254,JUL 8 2015,0,"The daily energy requirements of animals are determined by a combination of physical and physiological factors, but food availability may challenge the capacity to meet nutritional needs. Western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) are an interesting model for investigating this topic because they are folivore-frugivores that adjust their diet and activities to seasonal variation in fruit availability. Observations of one habituated group of western gorillas in Bai-Hokou, Central African Republic (December 2004-December 2005) were used to examine seasonal variation in diet quality and nutritional intake. We tested if during the high fruit season the food consumed by western gorillas was higher in quality (higher in energy, sugar, fat but lower in fibre and antifeedants) than during the low fruit season. Food consumed during the high fruit season was higher in digestible energy, but not any other macronutrients. Second, we investigated whether the gorillas increased their daily intake of carbohydrates, metabolizable energy (KCal/g OM), or other nutrients during the high fruit season. Intake of dry matter, fibers, fat, protein and the majority of minerals and phenols decreased with increased frugivory and there was some indication of seasonal variation in intake of energy (KCal/g OM), tannins, protein/fiber ratio, and iron. Intake of non-structural carbohydrates and sugars was not influenced by fruit availability. Gorillas are probably able to extract large quantities of energy via fermentation since they rely on proteinaceous leaves during the low fruit season. Macronutrients and micronutrients, but not digestible energy, may be limited for them during times of low fruit availability because they are hind-gut fermenters. We discuss the advantages of seasonal frugivores having large dietary breath and flexibility, significant characteristics to consider in the conservation strategies of endangered species."

The epicenter of group O was later found to be in Central Africa, overlapping with the geographical location of the central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), the likely original hosts of group a Although the prevalence of group O has remained low at 1-2% in Cameroon, some European countries (France, Spain, Belgium) with strong colonial ties to Central Africa have reported the highest prevalence out of Africa. The sequence diversity between HIV-1 group O and M strains is huge, reaching 50 and 30% in the envelope and pol, respectively. This diversity has hindered diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of group O-infected patients. Due to the intrinsic presence of the C181 mutation in group O, more than 60% of the approximately 30,000 individuals that live with this virus are faced with the challenge of drug resistance to some currently used antiretroviral therapies, notably the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Despite its susceptibility to most antiretroviral therapies, some group Os show a high variable baseline susceptibility to enfuvirtide (T20) and maraviroc. Group O strains are the least fit among all HIV-1 and -2 and restrict tetherin using their Nef but not Vpu as reported for group M. Although limited follow-up studies indicate that the natural course of group O is similar to that of M, these viruses are dominantly CCR5 tropic even late in infection, suggesting slow disease progression. This review summarizes important findings that marked the discovery, origin, spread, evolution, pathogenesis, and treatment of group O within the last 25 years."

However very little research exists on the impacts of visitors on animal behaviour and stress in free range exhibits. We investigated the effects of visitor number on the behaviour and stress physiology of Kangaroo Island (KI) Kangaroos, Macropus fuliginosus fuliginosus, and Red Kangaroos, Macropus rufus, housed in two free range exhibits in Australian zoos. Behavioural observations were conducted on individual kangaroos at each site using instantaneous scan sampling to record activity (e.g., vigilance, foraging, resting) and distance from the visitor pathway. Individually identifiable faecal samples were collected at the end of each study day and analysed for faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentration. When visitor number increased, both KI Kangaroos and Red Kangaroos increased the time spent engaged in visitor-directed vigilance and KI Kangaroos also increased the time spent engaged in locomotion and decreased the time spent resting. There was no effect of visitor number on the distance kangaroos positioned themselves from the visitor pathway or FGM concentration in either species. While there are limitations in interpreting these results in terms of fear of visitors, there was no evidence of adverse effects animal welfare in these study groups based on avoidance behaviour or stress physiology under the range of visitor numbers that we studied.

These groups exhibit long-term cohesion and stability and males in bachelor groups are no more aggressive than males in mixed-sex groups. Previous studies have shown that aggression in male gorillas is more directly related to age rather than group type, with young silverbacks (YSB; males 14-20 years of age) having higher rates of aggressive behavior than males of other age classes. Despite this, anecdotal reports have persisted that bachelor groups have higher wounding rates than mixed-sex groups. To assess wounding in zoo-housed gorillas, all instances of wounding across 28 zoos (180 gorillas, 45 social groups) were recorded over a 26 months period via a standardized data sheet. Similar to previous reports, we found age to be an important determinant in wounding. Bachelor groups that contained YSB's had significantly more wounds than bachelor groups without YSB's (U=14.0, z=-2.193, P=0.029). There was no difference in wounding rates between mixed-sex and bachelor groups without YSB's (U=69.5, z=-0.411, P=0.689).

Our results reveal high levels of hand disparity among modern hominoids, which are explained by different evolutionary processes: autapomorphic evolution in hylobatids (extreme digital and thumb elongation), convergent adaptation between chimpanzees and orangutans (digital elongation) and comparatively little change in gorillas and hominins. The human (and australopith) high thumb-to-digits ratio required little change since the LCA, and was acquired convergently with other highly dexterous anthropoids."

Treatments were imposed for 1-day periods, with five replicates of each treatment (total of 10 study days). Instantaneous point sampling and continuous sampling were used to record penguin behaviour including proximity to visitor viewing area, surface swimming, diving, vigilance, visibility, resting and intra-group aggression during a total of 3 h on each of the 10 study days. When exposed to visitors, penguins showed increased levels of aggression (P = 0.02), huddling (P = 0.049) and behaviours indicative of avoidance of visitors including increased time spent positioned behind enclosure features (P=0.024) and increased distance from the visitor viewing area (P=0.002).

Lucy's pelvis shape was the most transversely oval, short and broad, termed platypelloid. Modern female pelves were transversely oval only at the inlet. A protruding ischial spine, fairly small ischial tuberosities and a sacral concavity made Lucy closer to Homo sapiens and less like the great apes. In the last group, pelvic planes were anteroposteriorly oval, except in the gorilla, where the outlet was round or slightly transversely oval. The subpubic angle was narrowest in Lucy, whereas it was greater than 90A degrees in the great apes.

The female pelvis is involved in both visceral support and parturition and represents a compromise. The narrower pelvis of Australopithecus Lucy provided protection against genital prolapse, but resulted in complex obstetrical mechanics. From an evolutionary perspective, the pelvis of Homo sapiens became modified to make parturition easier, but increased the risk of genital prolapse: the ilia became wide open laterally and the sacrum broadened with a shorter distance between the sacroiliac and coxofemoral joints."
Social inhibitory control in five lemur species,"['Reddy, RB', 'MacLean, EL', 'Sandel, AA', 'Hare, B']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-015-0467-1,JUL 2015,0,"We tested five lemur species-ring-tailed lemurs, ruffed lemurs, mongoose lemurs, black lemurs, and Coquerel's sifakas-(N = 52) in an experiment that evaluated skills for inhibitory control in a social context. First, two human experimenters presented identical food rewards; the ""generous"" experimenter allowed the subject to eat from her hand, whereas the ""competitive"" experimenter always withheld the reward. Lemurs quickly learned to approach the generous experimenter and avoid the competitive one. In the inhibition test phase, we endowed the competitive experimenter with a more valuable food reward but the competitive experimenter continued to withhold food from the subject. Thus, lemurs were required to inhibit approaching the more desirable reward in favor of the lesser but obtainable reward presented by the generous experimenter. In test trials, lemurs' tendency to approach the competitive experimenter increased from the reputation phase, demonstrating sensitivity to the experimental manipulation. However, subjects approached the larger reward less frequently in test trials compared with pretest food-preference trials, evidencing some capacity for inhibitory control in this context. Despite differences in sociality and ecology, the five lemur species did not differ in this ability. Although the study did not uncover species differences, this experimental task may provide a useful measure of social inhibition in broader comparative studies."
Intentional gestural communication and discrimination of human attentional states in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta),"['Canteloup, C', 'Bovet, D', 'Meunier, H']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-015-0856-2,JUL 2015,0,"The present study tested intentionality of a learned begging gesture and attention-reading abilities in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Subjects were trained to produce a begging gesture towards a hidden food reward that could be delivered by a human experimenter. More specifically, we investigated which attentional cues-body, face and/or eyes orientation of a human partner-were taken into account by the macaques in order to communicate with her. Our results provide strong evidence of intentional communication: the monkeys adjusted their behaviour to that of the partner. The latter's attentional state influenced the monkeys' likelihood of performing begging gestures and showing gaze alternation between the partner and the hidden food. By contrast, we found no evidence of attention-getting behaviours, persistence or elaboration of new communicative behaviours. Our results also showed that rhesus macaques discriminated gross cues including the presence, body and face orientation of the human experimenter but not her eyes. However, the monkeys emitted more gaze alternation and monitored the human's attentional state more closely when she also displayed gaze alternation, suggesting an important role of joint attention in gestural communication."
Reproductive competition and inbreeding avoidance in a primate species with habitual female dispersal,"['Vigilant, L', 'Roy, J', 'Bradley, BJ', 'Stoneking, CJ', 'Robbins, MM', 'Stoinski, TS']",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,10.1007/s00265-015-1930-0,JUL 2015,2,"As in other highly sexually dimorphic, group-living animals, reproduction in gorillas has been largely viewed as the outcome of competition among males. However, females may exert choice via dispersal decisions or choice of partner in multimale groups, and males may also mate selectively. Here, we examine the paternity of 79 wild mountain gorilla offspring born into four groups characterized by stable dominance hierarchies and the presence of mature offspring of the dominant male. We found that on average the dominant male sires the majority (72 %) of the offspring in stable multimale groups and subordinate males also produce offspring, particularly when dominant males become older or the number of competing males increases. Although expected to disperse to avoid inbreeding, only half of the maturing daughters of dominant males left the group in which their father maintained dominance. However, in all five cases of reproduction by a resident daughter of a dominant male, a subordinate male was the sire of the offspring. As females commonly initiate and end copulations, and dominant males may prefer mating with fully mature females, both male and female mate preferences in addition to male competition apparently play a role in reproductive patterns in multimale groups, emphasizing the complexity of social dynamics in one of our closest living relatives."
Unique human orbital morphology compared with that of apes,"['Denion, E', 'Hitier, M', 'Guyader, V', 'Dugue, AE', 'Mouriaux, F']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,10.1038/srep11528,JUN 25 2015,1,"Humans' and apes' convergent (front-facing) orbits allow a large overlap of monocular visual fields but are considered to limit the lateral visual field extent. However, humans can greatly expand their lateral visual fields using eye motion. This study aimed to assess whether the human orbital morphology was unique compared with that of apes in avoiding lateral visual field obstruction. The orbits of 100 human skulls and 120 ape skulls (30 gibbons; 30 orangutans; 30 gorillas; 30 chimpanzees and bonobos) were analyzed. The orbital width/height ratio was calculated. Two orbital angles representing orbital convergence and rearward position of the orbital margin respectively were recorded using a protractor and laser levels. Humans have the largest orbital width/height ratio (1.19; p < 0.001). Humans and gibbons have orbits which are significantly less convergent than those of chimpanzees/bonobos, gorillas and orangutans (p < 0.001). These elements suggest a morphology favoring lateral vision in humans. More specifically, the human orbit has a uniquely rearward temporal orbital margin (107.1 degrees; p < 0.001), suitable for avoiding visual obstruction and promoting lateral visual field expansion through eye motion. Such an orbital morphology may have evolved mainly as an adaptation to open-country habitat and bipedal locomotion."
Disproportionate Cochlear Length in Genus Homo Shows a High Phylogenetic Signal during Apes' Hearing Evolution,"['Braga, J', 'Loubes, JM', 'Descouens, D', 'Dumoncel, J', 'Thackeray, JF', 'Kahn, JL', 'de Beer, F', 'Riberon, A', 'Hoffman, K', 'Balaresque, P', 'Gilissen, E', 'AUDITORY-CORTEX']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0127780,JUN 17 2015,0,"Changes in lifestyles and body weight affected mammal life-history evolution but little is known about how they shaped species' sensory systems. Since auditory sensitivity impacts communication tasks and environmental acoustic awareness, it may have represented a deciding factor during mammal evolution, including apes. Here, we statistically measure the influence of phylogeny and allometry on the variation of five cochlear morphological features associated with hearing capacities across 22 living and 5 fossil catarrhine species. We find high phylogenetic signals for absolute and relative cochlear length only. Comparisons between fossil cochleae and reconstructed ape ancestral morphotypes show that Australopithecus absolute and relative cochlear lengths are explicable by phylogeny and concordant with the hypothetized ((Pan,Homo),Gorilla) and (Pan,Homo) most recent common ancestors. Conversely, deviations of the Paranthropus oval window area from these most recent common ancestors are not explicable by phylogeny and body weight alone, but suggest instead rapid evolutionary changes (directional selection) of its hearing organ. Premodern (Homo erectus) and modern human cochleae set apart from living non-human catarrhines and australopiths. They show cochlear relative lengths and oval window areas larger than expected for their body mass, two features corresponding to increased low-frequency sensitivity more recent than 2 million years ago. The uniqueness of the ""hypertrophied"" cochlea in the genus Homo (as opposed to the australopiths) and the significantly high phylogenetic signal of this organ among apes indicate its usefulness to identify homologies and monophyletic groups in the hominid fossil record."
The Nutritional Geometry of Resource Scarcity: Effects of Lean Seasons and Habitat Disturbance on Nutrient Intakes and Balancing in Wild Sifakas,"['Irwin, MT', 'Raharison, JL', 'Raubenheimer, DR', 'Chapman, CA', 'Rothman, JM']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0128046,JUN 10 2015,0,"Animals experience spatial and temporal variation in food and nutrient supply, which may cause deviations from optimal nutrient intakes in both absolute amounts (meeting nutrient requirements) and proportions (nutrient balancing). Recent research has used the geometric framework for nutrition to obtain an improved understanding of how animals respond to these nutritional constraints, among them free-ranging primates including spider monkeys and gorillas. We used this framework to examine macronutrient intakes and nutrient balancing in sifakas (Propithecus diadema) at Tsinjoarivo, Madagascar, in order to quantify how these vary across seasons and across habitats with varying degrees of anthropogenic disturbance. Groups in intact habitat experience lean season decreases in frugivory, amounts of food ingested, and nutrient intakes, yet preserve remarkably constant proportions of dietary macronutrients, with the proportional contribution of protein to the diet being highly consistent. Sifakas in disturbed habitat resemble intact forest groups in the relative contribution of dietary macronutrients, but experience less seasonality: all groups' diets converge in the lean season, but disturbed forest groups largely fail to experience abundant season improvements in food intake or nutritional outcomes. These results suggest that: (1) lemurs experience seasonality by maintaining nutrient balance at the expense of calories ingested, which contrasts with earlier studies of spider monkeys and gorillas, (2) abundant season foods should be the target of habitat management, even though mortality might be concentrated in the lean season, and (3) primates' within-group competitive landscapes, which contribute to variation in social organization, may vary in complex ways across habitats and seasons."
New Insights into the Evolution of the Human Diet from Faecal Biomarker Analysis in Wild Chimpanzee and Gorilla Faeces,"['Sistiaga, A', 'Wrangham, R', 'Rothman, JM', 'Summons, RE']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0128931,JUN 10 2015,0,"Our understanding of early human diets is based on reconstructed biomechanics of hominin jaws, bone and teeth isotopic data, tooth wear patterns, lithic, taphonomic and zooarchaeological data, which do not provide information about the relative amounts of different types of foods that contributed most to early human diets. Faecal biomarkers are proving to be a valuable tool in identifying relative proportions of plant and animal tissues in Palaeolithic diets. A limiting factor in the application of the faecal biomarker approach is the striking absence of data related to the occurrence of faecal biomarkers in non-human primate faeces. In this study we explored the nature and proportions of sterols and stanols excreted by our closest living relatives. This investigation reports the first faecal biomarker data for wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei). Our results suggest that the chemometric analysis of faecal biomarkers is a useful tool for distinguishing between NHP and human faecal matter, and hence, it could provide information for palaeodietary research and early human diets."

A Severe Bite From a Nonhuman Primate Is a Major Risk Factor for HTLV-1 Infection in Hunters From Central Africa,"['Filippone, C', 'Betsem, E', 'Tortevoye, P', 'Cassar, O', 'Bassot, S', 'Froment, A', 'Fontanet, A', 'Gessain, A']",CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES,10.1093/cid/civ145,JUN 1 2015,1,"Background. HTLV-1 infection is endemic to Central African populations. The risk factors for HTLV-1 acquisition in humans via the interspecies transmission of STLV-1 (its simian counterpart) remain largely unknown.

Methods. We studied 269 individuals (254 men, 15 women) bitten by a nonhuman primate (NHP), mostly during hunting activities. These, Pygmies and Bantus, living in the southern Cameroonian rainforest, were matched for sex, age, and ethnicity with individuals from the same settlements reporting no NHP bites. HTLV-1 serology was performed by Western blot on plasma samples. PCR was carried out for HTLV-1 provirus on buffy-coat DNAs. The amplified products were sequenced and analyzed by phylogenetic analyses.

Results. HTLV-1 prevalence was 8.6% (23/269) in individuals with bites, vs 1.5% (4/269) in matched controls (P < .001). Moreover, HTLV-1 infection was linked to bite severity. The 23 HTLV-1-positive bitten individuals reported being bitten by a gorilla (17), chimpanzee (3), or small monkey (3). Thirteen (56%) were coinfected with a simian foamy virus known to be acquired through severe bites. Mother-to-child infection was excluded in 6 HTLV-1-infected bitten individuals. All the HTLV-1-positive hunters bitten by a gorilla or chimpanzee were infected with a subtype B strain similar to that present in apes from the same area. Two hunters bitten by small monkeys (C. agilis in one case) were infected with a HTLV-1 subtype F strain very similar to the STLV-1 strains present in such monkeys.

Conclusions. These results strongly suggest ongoing direct zoonotic acquisition of STLV-1 in humans through severe NHP bites during hunting activities."
Infanticide as Sexual Conflict: Coevolution of Male Strategies and Female Counterstrategies,"['Palombit, RA']",COLD SPRING HARBOR PERSPECTIVES IN BIOLOGY,10.1101/cshperspect.a017640,JUN 2015,1,"One of the earliest recognized forms of sexual conflict was infanticide by males, which imposes serious costs on female reproductive success. Here I review two bodies of evidence addressing coevolved strategies of males and females. The original sexual selection hypothesis arguing that infanticide improves male mating success by accelerating the return of females to fertilizable condition has been generally supported in some taxa-notably, some primates, carnivores, rodents, and cetaceans-but not in other taxa. One result of recent research has been to implicate other selective benefits of infanticide by males in various taxa from insects to birds to mammals, such as acquisition of breeding status or improvement of the female breeding condition. In some cases, however, the adaptive significance of male infanticide remains obscure. The second body of data I review is arguably the most important result of recent research: clarifying the possible female counterstrategies to infanticide. These potential counterstrategies span diverse biological systems, ranging from sexual behavior (e.g., polyandrous mating), to physiology (e.g., the Bruce effect), to individual behavior (e.g., maternal aggression), to social strategies (e.g., association with coalitionary defenders of either sex). Although much remains to be studied, these current data provide compelling evidence of sexually antagonistic coevolution surrounding the phenomenon of infanticide."
The role of character displacement in the molarization of hominin mandibular premolars,"['Schroer, K', 'Wood, B']",EVOLUTION,10.1111/evo.12672,JUN 2015,1,"Closely related species are likely to experience resource competition in areas where their ranges overlap. Fossil evidence suggests that hominins in East Africa c. 2-1.5 million years ago may have lived synchronically and sympatrically, and that competition may have contributed to the different tooth sizes observed in Homo and Paranthropus. To assess the likelihood that these taxa overlapped, we applied a character displacement model to the postcanine tooth size of fossil hominins and validated this model in populations of living primates. Mandibular fourth premolar (P-4) crown size was measured from fossil taxa and from living primate species where dietary overlap is established. Dimensions of the P-4 crown were fitted to a character matrix and described as the response variables of a generalized linear model that took taxon and location as input variables. The model recovered significant divergence in samples of closely related, living primates. When applied to fossil hominins the same model detected strong indications of character displacement between early Homo and Paranthropus (P = 0.002) on the basis of their P-4 crown size. Our study is an example of how ecologically informed morphologies measured in appropriate extant referents can provide a comparative context for assessing community and ecological evolution in the fossil record."
Selection Algorithm for Locomotion Based on the Evaluation of Falling Risk,"['Kobayashi, T', 'Aoyama, T', 'Sekiyama, K', 'Fukuda, T']",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS,10.1109/TRO.2015.2426451,JUN 2015,0,"An environmentally specific type of locomotion (e.g., bipedal or quadrupedal walking) is effective only under the specified environments. However, other conditions could cause physical body constraints and decrease mobility. Despite these constraints, legged robots are desired with high overall mobility such that they can walk under various conditions. Thus, a combination of types of locomotion is needed to maximize overall mobility. We have developed a gorilla-type robot, which can switch between bipedal and quadrupedal walking. A selection technique to optimize locomotion choice would be beneficial to the robot, which will experience challenging situations when walking through complex terrains, receiving disturbances, or malfunctioning. We present a selection algorithm for locomotion (SAL) that improves overall mobility by autonomously selecting the optimal locomotion. The falling risk of each locomotion mode is evaluated with a Bayesian network to represent the robot's situation. The evaluation function for the SAL determines the optimal locomotion choice based on falling risk and moving speed. In this paper, the SAL is used for two state variables of locomotion: gait (Ga-SAL) and speed (Sp-SAL). Both the simulations and experiments validated that the robot traveled efficiently in complex environments."

A geometric morphometric analysis of acetabular shape of the primate hip joint in relation to locomotor behaviour,"['San Millan, M', 'Kaliontzopoulou, A', 'Rissech, C', 'Turbon, D']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.03.007,JUN 2015,0,"The description of acetabular shape variation among primates is essential for our understanding of the locomotor behaviour and ecology of both extant and fossil species. In this study, we use two-dimensional geometric morphometrics to examine variation in acetabular shape in human and non-human primates and to determine the degree to which it co-varies with locomotor behaviour, while taking both intra and inter-specific variation into account. To these ends, we examined the acetabulum of 303 left hip bones of 27 extant genera of primates (including humans) with different locomotor behaviours. After accounting for shape variation due to sex, size, and phylogeny, the results confirm that acetabular shape varies significantly across locomotor groups. The two most differentiated locomotor groups are leapers and slow-climbing quadrupeds, which exhibit a unique acetabular shape. Furthermore, the acetabulum of humans differed significantly from all other groups, while no significant differences existed between chimpanzees and gorillas. The most noticeable differences are detected in both cranial and dorsal areas and around the acetabular horns. This variation in acetabular morphology may have biomechanical implications at the level of the hip joint, potentially determining joint range motion and load distribution during locomotion. Given the increasing number of published studies on fossil pelves, our results are widely applicable to fossil analyses, with critical implications for paleoanthropological analyses about the complex locomotor behaviour of fossil specimens and their classification into locomotor groups, which may enhance our understanding of their ecological habits.

Shared Selective Pressures on Fungal and Human Metabolic Pathways Lead to Divergent yet Analogous Genetic Responses,"['Eidem, HR', 'McGary, KL', 'Rokas, A']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msv034,JUN 2015,0,"Reduced metabolic efficiency, toxic intermediate accumulation, and deficits of molecular building blocks, which all stem from disruptions of flux through metabolic pathways, reduce organismal fitness. Although these represent shared selection pressures across organisms, the genetic signatures of the responses to them may differ. In fungi, a frequently observed signature is the physical linkage of genes from the same metabolic pathway. In contrast, human metabolic genes are rarely tightly linked; rather, they tend to show tissue-specific coexpression. We hypothesized that the physical linkage of fungal metabolic genes and the tissue-specific coexpression of human metabolic genes are divergent yet analogous responses to the range of selective pressures imposed by disruptions of flux. To test this, we examined the degree to which the human homologs of physically linked metabolic genes in fungi (fungal linked homologs or FLOs) are coexpressed across six human tissues. We found that FLOs are significantly more correlated in their expression profiles across human tissues than other metabolic genes. We obtained similar results in analyses of the same six tissues from chimps, gorillas, orangutans, and macaques. We suggest that when selective pressures remain stable across large evolutionary distances, evidence of selection in a given evolutionary lineage can become a highly reliable predictor of the signature of selection in another, even though the specific adaptive response in each lineage is markedly different."
Effects of visual contact with zoo visitors on black-capped capuchin welfare,"['Sherwen, SL', 'Harvey, TJ', 'Magrath, MJL', 'Butler, KL', 'Fanson, KV', 'Hemsworth, PH']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2015.03.004,JUN 2015,1,"Previous research has suggested that the presence of zoo visitors may be stressful for various primate species, and visual contact with visitors may be the sensory stimuli that mediate visitor effects. We studied a group of black-capped capuchins, Cebus apella, in a controlled experiment, randomly imposing two treatments: customised one-way vision screens on the exhibit viewing windows to reduce visual contact with visitors; and unmodified viewing windows that allow full visual contact with visitors. We sampled capuchin behaviour including intra-group aggression and other social interactions, vigilance and abnormal behaviours. To provide a measure of physiological stress, we also analysed capuchin faecal samples for glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentration. When the view of visitors was obscured, we found marked reductions in capuchin aggression (from 14.5 bouts to 4.6 bouts per weekend, P = 0.004) and FGM concentration (from 620 to 410 ng/g, P = 0.008) among all adults, as well as reductions in abnormal behaviour (P = 0.01) in two individuals. The capuchins also avoided the visitor viewing area (P = 0.003) in the unmodified viewing window treatment. These results suggest that reducing the capuchins' ability to view visitors improved their welfare. However we also found a reduction in the number of visitors when visual contact was reduced (from an average of 23 visitors per scan to 15, P = 0.008), suggesting that the visitor experience may have been compromised by the lack of interaction with the capuchins. These results highlight a possible dilemma for the zoo industry between enhancing animal welfare in primates and providing for visitor experience. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Effect of preservation method on spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) fecal microbiota over 8 weeks,"['Hale, VL', 'Tan, CL', 'Knight, R', 'Amato, KR']",JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS,10.1016/j.mimet.2015.03.021,JUN 2015,1,"Studies of the gut microbiome have become increasingly common with recent technological advances. Gut microbes play an important role in human and animal Health, and gut microbiome analysis holds great potential for evaluating health in wildlife, as microbiota can be assessed from non-invasively collected fecal samples. However, many common fecal preservation protocols (e.g. freezing at -80 degrees C) are not suitable for field conditions, or have not been tested for long-term (greater than 2 weeks) storage. In this study, we collected fresh fecal samples from captive spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) at the Columbian Park Zoo (Lafayette, IN, USA). The samples were pooled, homogenized, and preserved for up to 8 weeks prior to DNA extraction and sequencing. Preservation methods included: freezing at -20 degrees C, freezing at -80 degrees C, immersion in 100% ethanol, application to FTA cards, and immersion in RNAlater. At 0 (fresh), 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks from fecal collection, DNA was extracted and microbial DNA was amplified and sequenced. DNA concentration, purity, microbial diversity, and microbial composition were compared across all methods and time points. DNA concentration and purity did not correlate with microbial diversity or composition. Microbial composition of frozen and ethanol samples were most similar to fresh samples. FTA card and RNAlater-preserved samples had the least similar microbial composition and abundance compared to fresh samples. Microbial composition and diversity were relatively stable over time within each preservation method. Based on these results, if freezers are not available, we recommend preserving fecal samples in ethanol (for up to 8 weeks) prior to microbial extraction and analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Little is known about the ecology of these pathogens in gorillas. A total of 131 gorilla fecal samples were collected from Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas to study the diversity and prevalence of Plasmodium species. The effects of sex and age as factors influencing levels of infection with Plasmodium in habituated gorilla groups were assessed. Ninety-five human blood samples from the same locality were also analysed to test for cross-transmission between humans and gorillas. According to a cytB PCR assay 32% of gorilla's fecal samples and 43.1% human individuals were infected with Plasmodium spp. All Laverania species, Plasmodium vivax, and for the first time Plasmodium ovale were identified from gorilla samples. Plasmodium praefalciparum was present only from habituated individuals and P. falciparum was detected from human samples. Although few P. vivax and P. ovale sequences were obtained from gorillas, the evidence for cross-species transmission between humans and gorillas requires more in depth analysis. No association was found between malaria infection and sex, however, younger individuals aged 6 years were more susceptible. Switching between two different Plasmodium spp. was observed in three individuals. Prolonged monitoring of Plasmodium infection during various seasons and recording behavioural data is necessary to draw a precise picture about the infection dynamics."
Body mass of wild bornean orangutans living in human-dominated landscapes: Implications for understanding their ecology and conservation,"['Rayadin, Y', 'Spehar, SN']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22709,JUN 2015,0,"Body mass is a key determinant of a species' ecology, including locomotion, foraging strategies, and energetics. Accurate information on the body mass of wild primates allows us to develop explanatory models for relationships among body size, ecology, and behavior and is crucial for reconstructing the ecology and behavior of fossil primates and hominins. Information on body mass can also provide indirect information on health and can be an important tool for conservation in the context of increasingly widespread habitat disturbance. This study reports body mass data recorded for wild Northeast Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus morio) during relocation efforts in forestry and oil palm plantations in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The average mass of flanged adult males (n = 12, 74 +/- 9.78 kg) and adult females (n = 7, 35.29 +/- 7.32 kg) from this study were 13.6% and 9% lower, respectively, than the only other published wild Bornean orangutan body mass measurements, but the range of weights for both males and females was larger for this study. This pattern could be due to sampling error, data collection differences, or the influence of habitat disturbance, specifically a lack of access to resources, on individual health. When necessary relocations present the opportunity, we encourage researchers to prioritize the collection of body size data for the purposes of understanding ecology but also as an indirect means of monitoring population viability. As primate habitat becomes increasingly fragmented and altered by humans such data will become critical to our ability to make informed conservation decisions. Am J Phys Anthropol 157:339-346, 2015.

"Male rank, not paternity, predicts male-immature relationships in mountain gorillas, Gorilla beringei beringei","['Rosenbaum, S', 'Hirwa, JP', 'Silk, JB', 'Vigilant, L', 'Stoinski, TS']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.02.025,JUN 2015,2,"Kin discrimination mechanisms are expected to evolve when they provide fitness benefits. To date, evidence for kin discrimination is mixed across taxa and mating systems even when it would apparently be beneficial. In animals with promiscuous mating systems, males were long believed to abstain from parenting behaviours partly because the costs of offspring misidentification outweighed the benefits of dual parenting. Conversely, males in monogamous systems could parent because of high paternity certainty. However, recent work has shown that in some species males parent despite high false paternity rates, and males in some promiscuous systems discriminate between their own and other males' offspring. Here we evaluate the impact of male dominance rank, paternity and age on male-immature relationships in wild mountain gorillas. Mountain gorillas provide an interesting context for assessing paternal kin discrimination because (1) male-immature relationships are strong, and (2) while their morphological characteristics suggest an evolutionary history of single-male groups, a substantial fraction contain multiple adult males. In our sample of 21 males and 49 genotyped immatures living in multimale groups monitored by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund's Karisoke Research Center, we found that male rank was the primary predictor of male-immature relationship strength. There was little evidence that paternity or age were related to relationship patterns. Male-immature dyads were closer social partners in 2011-12 when groups were smaller and reproductive skew lower, than comparable dyads in 2003-04 when groups were larger and skew higher. Gorillas' lack of paternal kin discrimination provides further behavioural evidence that the species' multimale social structure is evolutionarily novel. However, patterning of male-immature relationships and genetic paternity suggest a persistent minority of two-male groups throughout G. beringei's evolutionary history. This may help explain their ability to live in multimale, multifemale social units despite possessing morphological characteristics typical of harem systems.

Odor signals in wild western lowland gorillas: an involuntary and extra-group communication hypothesis,"['Masi, S', 'Bouret, S']",PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR,10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.03.022,JUN 1 2015,2,"Odors constitute one of the most ancient ways of communication among animals. Whereas the key role of olfactory communication is well established in insects or rodents, its contribution to primate behavior remains very speculative. In a recent report, Klailova and Lee [1] studied the variations of intensity of the typical steroid musk odor produced by wild adult male gorilla silverbacks during encounters with opponents from other social units (lone males or other groups). The odor intensity increased in situations of potential conflicts, when the silverback encountered another male gorilla, which constitutes a potential threat for his infants and mate competitor for his females. Importantly, the odor intensity was greater when the silverback reacted with a demonstrative threat display, and milder when he decided to react quietly and avoid the conflict by sneaking away. According to the authors, this indicates that silverback gorillas can flexibly adjust the odor signal to the social context and the mild signal associated with the quiet response is used within the silverback's group to promote cohesion. Rather, based on both physiological and behavioral data, we propose that (1) the odor intensity varies monotonically with arousal, across all situations, and (2) that the function of the odor signal is most relevant for the interactions between males of different groups. In such framework, the odor stimulus might also constitute a non-visual signal indicator of the emitter's identity, and therefore play a role in the regulation of the interactions with other gorillas. Establishing the balance among those potential functions is critical to understand the role of odors in the regulation of social and ecological interactions in primates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the conservation importance of understanding the ways in which primates modify their behavior to human pressures, data are lacking, even for well-studied species. Using systematically collected data (fecal samples, feeding traces, and direct observations), we examined the diet and feeding strategies of an unhabituated chimpanzee community (Pan troglodytes verus) at Caiquene-Cadique in Guinea-Bissau that inhabit a forest-savanna-mangrove-agricultural mosaic. The chimpanzees experienced marked seasonal variations in the availability of plant foods, but maintained a high proportion of ripe fruit in the diet across months. Certain wild species were identified as important to this community including oil-palm (Elaeis guineensis) fruit and flower. Honey was frequently consumed but no other insects or vertebrates were confirmed to be eaten by this community. However, we provide indirect evidence of possible smashing and consumption of giant African snails (Achatina sp.) by chimpanzees at this site. Caiquene-Cadique chimpanzees were confirmed to feed on nine different agricultural crops, which represented 13.6% of all plant species consumed. Consumption of fruit and nonfruit crops was regular, but did not increase during periods of wild fruit scarcity. Crop consumption is an increasing and potentially problematic behavior, which can impact local people's tolerance toward wildlife. To maximize the potential success of any human-wildlife coexistence strategy (e.g., to reduce primate crop feeding), knowledge of primate behavior, as well as multifaceted social dimensions of interactions, is critical.

"Modeling variation in early life mortality in the western lowland gorilla: Genetic, maternal and other effects","['Ahsan, MH', 'Blomquist, GE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22389,JUN 2015,0,"Uncovering sources of variation in gorilla infant mortality informs conservation and life history research efforts. The international studbook for the western lowland gorilla provides information on a sample of captive gorillas large enough for which to analyze genetic, maternal, and various other effects on early life mortality in this critically endangered species. We assess the importance of variables such as sex, maternal parity, paternal age, and hand rearing with regard to infant survival. We also quantify the proportions of variation in mortality influenced by heritable variation and maternal effects from these pedigree and survival data using variance component estimation. Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of generalized linear mixed models produce variance component distributions in an animal model framework that employs all pedigree information. Two models, one with a maternal identity component and one with both additive genetic and maternal identity components, estimate variance components for different age classes during the first 2 years of life. This is informative of the extent to which mortality risk factors change over time during gorilla infancy. Our results indicate that gorilla mortality is moderately heritable with the strongest genetic influence just after birth. Maternal effects are most important during the first 6 months of life. Interestingly, hand-reared infants have lower mortality for the first 6 months of life. Aside from hand rearing, we found other predictors commonly used in studies of primate infant mortality to have little influence in these gorilla data. Am. J. Primatol. 77:666-678, 2015.

We examined annual habitat use of a bonobo group in the Wamba field site within the Luo Scientific Reserve, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Using satellite imagery, we categorized the group's ranging area into three forest types: (1) primary and old secondary forest (P/OS), (2) young secondary forest and agriculture (YS/Ag), and (3) swamp forest (Sw). We tracked the group for 1 year (2007-2008) and compared usage of the three forest types for ranging, feeding, and night-sleeping. We also recorded what the bonobos ate and monitored monthly fruit availability in each forest type. The group ranged and fed more often in P/OS and less often in YS/Ag and Sw than expected based on habitat availability. Also, the group slept mostly in P/OS (94% of nights monitored), but also in YS/Ag (1%), and Sw (5%). Fruit availability in P/OS had no significant effect on habitat selection, but the group fed in YS/Ag most often during the two months when fruits in P/OS were least abundant. In June, when fruit of Uapaca spp. (selectively eaten by bonobos) was generally abundant in Sw, the group mostly ranged and slept there. The bonobos fed most often on herbaceous plants in all three forest types. In Sw, the bonobos frequently ate mushrooms. Our results show that semi-open forest with abundant herbaceous plants such as YS/Ag could be an important feeding habitat and may provide fallback food for bonobos when fruits are scarce. Furthermore, Sw can serve seasonally as a main habitat to complement P/OS if adequate food resources and tree nesting opportunities are available. We conclude that bonobos use diverse habitats depending on their needs and we highlight the importance of minor-use habitats for sustaining populations of target species in conservation planning. Am.

Based on individual and group interviews, this commentary provides a case study that describes how the Batwa now address their basic needs, and how they participate in the formation of subsistence markets and microenterprises. In positioning this study, four types of subsistence economies are identified: nature-based, nonprofit-based, market-based, and hybrid. In addition, different types of subsistence markets are identified, namely, within community and cross community markets. This then raises several questions for future research and for subsistence communities like the Batwa's regarding how to achieve sustainability."
"Inattentional blindness reflects limitations on perception, not memory: Evidence from repeated failures of awareness","['Ward, EJ', 'Scholl, BJ']",PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW,10.3758/s13423-014-0745-8,JUN 2015,1,"Perhaps the most striking phenomenon of visual awareness is inattentional blindness (IB), in which a surprisingly salient event right in front of you may go completely unseen when unattended. Does IB reflect a failure of perception, or only of subsequent memory? Previous work has been unable to answer this question, due to a seemingly intractable dilemma: ruling out memory requires immediate perceptual reports, but soliciting such reports fuels an expectation that eliminates IB. Here we introduce a way of evoking repeated IB in the same subjects and the same session: we show that observers fail to report seeing salient events' not only when they have no expectation, but also when they have the wrong expectations about the events nature. This occurs when observers must immediately report seeing anything unexpected, even mid-event. Repeated IB thus demonstrates that IB is aptly named: it reflects a genuine deficit in moment-by-moment conscious perception, rather than a form of inattentional amnesia."

Zoos and aquariums offer unique venues for teaching and research and a locus for expanding the footprint of behavior analysis. In North America, Europe, and the UK, formal agreements between zoos, aquariums, and university graduate departments have been operating successfully for decades. To expand on this model, it will be necessary to help zoo and aquarium managers throughout the world to recognize the value of behavior analysis in the delivery of essential animal health and welfare services.

These treatments were window uncovered, left side of the window covered or right side of the window covered. Observations were conducted on the orangutans present on the platform, and on their location (left or right side), and orientation (towards or away from the window) while on the platform. The partial covering of the window had little effect on the proportion of time orangutans spent on the viewing platform, or on the direction they faced when on the platform. When the orangutans were facing towards the window, and the right side was uncovered, irrespective of whether the left side was covered, they spent about three quarters of the time on the right side, suggesting a preference for the right side of the platform. However, when the right side was covered and the left side uncovered, the animals facing towards the window spent only about a quarter of the time on the right side, that is, they spent more time on the uncovered side.

"Do bimanual coordination, tool use, and body posture contribute equally to hand preferences in bonobos?","['Bardo, A', 'Pouydebat, E', 'Meunier, H']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.02.015,MAY 2015,1,"Approximately 90% of the human population is right-handed. The emergence of this hand preference in humans is thought to be linked to the ability to execute complex tasks and habitual bipedalism. In order to test these hypotheses, the present study explored, for the first time, hand preference in relation to both body posture (seated and bipedal) and task complexity (bimanual coordination and two tool use tasks of different complexity) in bonobos (Pan paniscus). Few studies have explored the effects of both posture and task complexity on handedness, and investigations with bonobos are scarce, particularly studies on tool use. Our study aims to overcome such a gap by addressing two main questions: 1) Does a bipedal posture increase the strength of hand preference and/or create a directional bias to the use of the right hand? 2) Independent of body posture, does task complexity increase the strength of the hand preference and/or create a directional bias to the use of the right hand? Our results show that independent of body posture, the more complex the task, the more lateralization occurred. Moreover, subjects tended to be right-handed for tasks involving tool use. However, posture had no significant effect on hand preference in the tasks tested here. Therefore, for a given task, bonobos were not more lateralized in a bipedal posture than in a seated one. Task complexity might thus have contributed more than bipedal posture to the emergence of human lateralization and the preponderance of right-handedness, although a larger sample size and more data are needed to be conclusive.

Furthermore, although previous mitochondrial analyses have shown that free-range gorilla populations exhibit substantial regional differentiation, nothing is known of the extent to which this variation has been preserved in captive populations. To address these questions, we combined 379 pedigree records with data from 52 mitochondrial sequences to infer individual haplogroup affiliations, geographical origin of wild founders and instances of inter-breeding between haplogroups in the United States captive gorilla population. We show that the current captive population contains all major mitochondrial lineages found within wild western lowland gorillas. Levels of haplotype diversity are also comparable to those found in wild populations. However, the majority of captive gorilla matings have occurred between individuals with different haplogroup affiliations. Although restricting crosses to individuals within the same haplogroup would preserve the phylogeographic structure present in the wild, careful management of captive populations is required to minimize the risk of drift and inbreeding. However, when captive animals are released back into the wild, we recommend that efforts should be made to preserve natural phylogeographic structure."
The potential of Social Network Analysis as a tool for the management of zoo animals,"['Rose, PE', 'Croft, DP']",ANIMAL WELFARE,10.7120/09627286.24.2.123,MAY 2015,0,"Social Network Analysis (SNA) enables the fine scale of animal sociality and population structure to be quantified. SNA is widely applied to questions relating to behavioural ecology but has seen little use in the application to zoo animal management, despite its clear potential. Investment in social bonds between individuals positively affects health status, welfare state, long-term fitness and lifetime reproductive output. Such positive affective states can be maintained consistently within captive situations if more information is known about the social preferences of the individuals that are kept. Disruption to social bonds may lead to impoverished welfare and stress to individuals which have seen their social support compromised. The patterning of social relationships between individuals also influences how space is utilised and how animals interact with resources provided for them. With more detailed knowledge of the social structure of a group or population, social groupings (for example, for captive breeding) can be specifically designed to minimise social stress. Likewise, enhancing the chances of successful reproduction can be achieved if we understand the role that each individual within a network plays and how these roles may impact on the behaviour of others. This paper discusses key aspects of SNA applicable to zoo-based researchers wishing to investigate the social lives of zoo animals. We present a review of how SNA can be used to assess social behaviour and highlight directions for future research. Our aim is to stimulate new research to ultimately improve our understanding of reproductive success, decision-making, group leadership, animal health and enclosure use. We conclude that what can be learned about the dynamics of social zoo-housed species using SNA can directly impact on husbandry decisions and help underpin excellent standards of animal welfare."

Numerous studies employing nonhuman primates (NHPs) were performed during the 1918 pandemic and the following decade. Most used bacterial preparations to infect animals, but some sought a filterable agent for the disease. Since the viral etiology of influenza was established in the early 1930s, studies in NHPs have been supplemented by a much larger number of experiments in mice, ferrets and human volunteers. However, the emergence of a novel swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus in 1976 and the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in 1997 stimulated an increase in NHP research, because these agents are difficult to study in naturally infected patients and cannot be administered to human volunteers. In this paper, we review the published literature on the use of NHPs in influenza research from 1893 through the end of 2014. The first section summarizes observational studies of naturally occurring influenza-like syndromes in wild and captive primates, including serologic investigations. The second provides a chronological account of experimental infections of NHPs, beginning with Pfeiffer's study and covering all published research on seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, including vaccine and antiviral drug testing. The third section reviews experimental infections of NHPs with avian influenza viruses that have caused disease in humans since 1997. The paper concludes with suggestions for further studies to more clearly define and optimize the role of NHPs as experimental animals for influenza research. Published by Elsevier B.V."

We have developed a theoretical framework that hypothesizes that in order for music to be effective with other species, it must be in the frequency range and with similar tempos to those used in natural communication by each species. We have used this framework to compose music that is species-appropriate for,a few animal species. In this paper, we created species-appropriate music for domestic cats and tested this music in comparison with music with similar affective content composed for humans. We presented two examples of cat music in counterbalanced order with two examples of human music, and we evaluated the behavior and response latencies of cats to each piece. Cats showed a significant preference for and interest in species-appropriate music compared with human music (median (interquartile range (IQR)) 1.5 (0.5-2.0) acts for cat music, 0.25(0.0-0.5) acts for human music, P<0.002) and responded with significantly shorter latencies (median (IQR) 110.0 (54-138.75)s for cat music, 171.75 (151-180)s for human music (p < 0.001). Younger and older cats were more responsive to cat music than middle-aged acts (cubic trend, r(2) = 0.477, P < 0.001).

To investigate the gut microbiome of wild primates and determine how these microbial communities respond to the host's external environment, we characterized faecal bacterial communities and, for the first time, gut metabolomes of four wild lowland gorilla groups in the Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic. Results show that geographical range may be an important modulator of the gut microbiomes and metabolomes of these gorilla groups. Distinctions seemed to relate to feeding behaviour, implying energy harvest through increased fruit consumption or fermentation of highly fibrous foods. These observations were supported by differential abundance of metabolites and bacterial taxa associated with the metabolism of cellulose, phenolics, organic acids, simple sugars, lipids and sterols between gorillas occupying different geographical ranges. Additionally, the gut microbiomes of a gorilla group under increased anthropogenic pressure could always be distinguished from that of all other groups. By characterizing the interplay between environment, behaviour, diet and symbiotic gut microbes, we present an alternative perspective on primate ecology and on the forces that shape the gut microbiomes of wild primates from an evolutionary context."
Quantity and spatial distribution of seeds dispersed by a western lowland gorilla population in south-east Cameroon,"['Petre, CA', 'Tagg, N', 'Beudels-Jamar, R', 'Haurez, B', 'Salah, M', 'Spetschinsky, V', 'Willie, J', 'Doucet, JL']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,10.1017/S0266467415000073,MAY 2015,4,"Understanding the ecological function of large frugivores in tropical forests is important considering their central position in seed-dispersal networks. This study illustrates the seed-dispersal effectiveness of a western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) population in Cameroon by looking at the interaction of seed quantity, species regeneration traits and the environmental characteristics of the deposition sites (sleeping sites vs. feeding trails) in order to discuss the role of gorillas within the ecosystem. The analysis of 1030 faecal samples collected over a 3-y period (September 2009-August 2012) showed that gorillas dispersed a diverse array of species (58 spp. identified), with an average of 289 intact seeds (>5 mm) d(-1) per individual. Seed damage during mouth and gut processing occurred for 12 spp., generally accounting for <5% of specific seed load. Germination trials suggested that germination success of passed seeds remained unchanged (N = 6 spp.) or improved (N = 5 spp.) after gut passage compared with hand-cleaned seeds, with one exception. Indicator species identification (IndVal method) and General Discriminant Analysis suggested that sleeping sites (N = 36), as a main type of seed deposition site, correspond to regenerating microhabitats and correspondingly degree of canopy openness is one variable discriminating significantly this type of deposition site with random locations in the forest (N = 36) used as a proxy for non-directed seed deposition on feeding trails. With a mean canopy openness of 19-27%, sleeping sites offer optimal light conditions for the seedling recruitment of non-pioneer light-demanding species, the seeds of which encompass 47.4% of the total seed load dispersed over the 3-y period. From this study, it is hypothesized that the gorilla performed directed-dispersal of some light-demanding plant species at sleeping sites, and hence, by being actively implicated in gap-phase dynamics, fulfils a valuable ecological function within its ecosystem."

Here, we review the role of sex-related differences in aggressive behaviour in both human and nonhuman primates. First, we address aggression in primates, which varies deeply between species, both in intensity and in display, ranging from animals that are very aggressive, such as chimpanzees, to the nonaggressive bonobos. Aggression also influences the hierarchical structure of gorillas and chimpanzees, and is used as the main tool for dealing with other groups. With regard to human aggression, it can be considered a relevant adaptation for survival or can have negative impacts on social interaction for both sexes. Gender plays a critical role in aggressive and competitive behaviours, which are determined by a cascade of physiological changes, including GABAergic and serotonergic systems, and sex neurosteroids. The understanding of the neurobiological bases and behavioural determinants of different types of aggression is fundamental for minimising these negative impacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Domestic pigs' (Sus scrofa domestica) use of direct and indirect visual and auditory cues in an object choice task,"['Nawroth, C', 'von Borell, E']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-015-0842-8,MAY 2015,0,"Recently, foraging strategies have been linked to the ability to use indirect visual information. More selective feeders should express a higher aversion against losses compared to non-selective feeders and should therefore be more prone to avoid empty food locations. To extend these findings, in this study, we present a series of studies investigating the use of direct and indirect visual and auditory information by an omnivorous but selective feeder-the domestic pig. Subjects had to choose between two buckets, with only one containing a reward. Before making a choice, the subjects in Experiment 1 (N = 8) received full information regarding both the baited and non-baited location, either in a visual or auditory domain. In this experiment, the subjects were able to use visual but not auditory cues to infer the location of the reward spontaneously. Additionally, four individuals learned to use auditory cues after a period of training. In Experiment 2 (N = 8), the pigs were given different amounts of visual information about the content of the buckets-lifting either both of the buckets (full information), the baited bucket (direct information), the empty bucket (indirect information) or no bucket at all (no information). The subjects as a group were able to use direct and indirect visual cues. However, over the course of the experiment, the performance dropped to chance level when indirect information was provided. A final experiment (N = 3) provided preliminary results for pigs' use of indirect auditory information to infer the location of a reward. We conclude that pigs at a very young age are able to make decisions based on indirect information in the visual domain, whereas their performance in the use of indirect auditory information warrants further investigation."

The study investigated the influence of laser beam scanning mode on material removal efficiency in laser ablation of Gorilla glass using ps NIR laser pulses. The study revealed that crack-free and debris-free ablation could be achieved by optimizing beam overlaps. Optimal scanning speed was above 200 mm/s with a few pulses overlapped in one ablation spot during scanning. When laser was focused at glass bottom surface, laser energy was more efficiently employed for glass ablation due to negligible energy dispersion caused by ejected materials. The cutting time was 1.36 times and 24.5 times longer for focus at glass center and top surface, respectively. The cut kerf width was found to correlate with scanning line numbers. Optimal kerf for high material removal rate was approximately half of the glass thickness. Optimal shifting pitch between two lines was approximately a single scan line width, namely an ablation spot diameter. The cutting time was 1.51 times and 13.43 times longer for merge-mode and group-mode, respectively, when compared to scanning with raster-mode. Fixed parameter mode reduced 86% of cutting time compared to non-fixed parameter mode. Similar protocol of scanning mode for high material removal efficiency was applicable to ps NIR laser ablation of aluminosilicate glass and ns UV laser ablation of silicon substrate. Mathematical model for calculation of beam overlaps, scanning speed and line number was provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The Template Method enables simultaneous evaluation of multiple skeletal sites, thereby greatly expanding sample size, and reveals that Australopithecus afarensis dimorphism was similar to that of modern humans. A new very large partial skeleton (KSD-VP-1/1 or ""Kadanuumuu"") can now also be used, like Lucy, as a template specimen. In addition, the recently developed Geometric Mean Method has been used to argue that Australopithecus afarensis was equally or even more dimorphic than gorillas. However, in its previous application Lucy and A.L. 128/129 accounted for 10 of 11 estimates of female size. Here we directly compare the two methods and demonstrate that including multiple measurements from the same partial skeleton that falls at the margin of the species size range dramatically inflates dimorphism estimates. Prevention of the dominance of a single specimen's contribution to calculations of multiple dimorphism estimates confirms that Australopithecus afarensis was only moderately dimorphic."
Mountain gorilla genomes reveal the impact of long-term population decline and inbreeding,"['Xue, YL', 'Prado-Martinez, J', 'Sudmant, PH', 'Narasimhan, V', 'Ayub, Q', 'Szpak, M', 'Frandsen, P', 'Chen, Y', 'Yngvadottir, B', 'Cooper, DN', 'de Manuel, M', 'Hernandez-Rodriguez, J', 'Lobon, I', 'Siegismund, HR', 'Pagani, L', 'Quail, MA', 'Hvilsom, C', 'Mudakikwa, A', 'Eichler, EE', 'Cranfield, MR', 'Marques-Bonet, T', 'Tyler-Smith, C', 'Scally, A']",SCIENCE,10.1126/science.aaa3952,APR 10 2015,6,"Mountain gorillas are an endangered great ape subspecies and a prominent focus for conservation, yet we know little about their genomic diversity and evolutionary past. We sequenced whole genomes from multiple wild individuals and compared the genomes of all four Gorilla subspecies. We found that the two eastern subspecies have experienced a prolonged population decline over the past 100,000 years, resulting in very low genetic diversity and an increased overall burden of deleterious variation. A further recent decline in the mountain gorilla population has led to extensive inbreeding, such that individuals are typically homozygous at 34% of their sequence, leading to the purging of severely deleterious recessive mutations from the population. We discuss the causes of their decline and the consequences for their future survival."
Toward a Biology of Collectivism: Reducing the East West Divide to Its Physical and Physiological Substrates,"['Hertler, SC']",SAGE OPEN,10.1177/2158244015590161,APR-JUN 2015,0,"The signs of mating competition are written into the physiology of the human male, but they are not written equally into the physiology of all racial groupings of human males. It seems that Asian males are different, different in that they are more fully dissimilar from the gorilla than are other races, showing less sexual dimorphism, muscularity, and less marked secondary sexual characteristics, and different in that they are more fully dissimilar from the chimpanzee than are other races, showing less sexual drive and activity as well as smaller testicles and lower sperm counts. It is presently argued that such anatomical differences are a testament to a more peaceably monogamous mating history. In turn, it is then argued that such physiological markers are directly associated with the collectivist ethos that has been historically, anthropologically, and sociologically observed among the Asian people."

OASes and STING: Adaptive Evolution in Concert,"['Mozzi, A', 'Pontremoli, C', 'Forni, D', 'Clerici, M', 'Pozzoli, U', 'Bresolin, N', 'Cagliani, R', 'Sironi, M']",GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/gbe/evv046,APR 2015,1,"OAS (2'aEuro""5'-oligoadenylate synthases) proteins and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS, gene symbol: MB21D1) patrol the cytoplasm for the presence of foreign nucleic acids. Upon binding to double-stranded RNA or double-stranded DNA, OAS proteins and cGAS produce nucleotide second messengers to activate RNase L and STING (stimulator of interferon genes, gene symbol: TMEM173), respectively; this leads to the initiation of antiviral responses. We analyzed the evolutionary history of the MB21D1-TMEM173 and OAS-RNASEL axes in primates and bats and found evidence of widespread positive selection in both orders. In TMEM173, residue 230, a major determinant of response to natural ligands and to mimetic drugs (e.g., DMXAA), was positively selected in Primates and Chiroptera. In both orders, selection also targeted an alpha-helix/loop element in RNase L that modulates the enzyme preference for single-stranded RNA versus stem loops. Analysis of positively selected sites in OAS1, OAS2, and MB21D1 revealed parallel evolution, with the corresponding residues being selected in different genes. As this cannot result from gene conversion, these data suggest that selective pressure acting on OAS and MB21D1 genes is related to nucleic acid recognition and to the specific mechanism of enzyme activation, which requires a conformational change. Finally, a population genetics-phylogenetics analysis in humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas detected several positively selected sites in most genes. Data herein shed light into species-specific differences in infection susceptibility and in response to synthetic compounds, with relevance for the design of synthetic compounds as vaccine adjuvants."

To assist in answering this question, we have identified insertions in the human genome which cannot be found in five comparison primate species: Chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, and macaque. A total of 21,269 nonpolymorphic human-specific insertions were identified, of which only 372 were found in exons. Any function conferred by the remaining 20,897 is likely to be regulatory. Many of these insertions are likely to have been fitness neutral; however, a small number has been identified in genes showing signs of positive selection. Insertions found within positively selected genes show associations to neural phenotypes, which were also enriched in the whole data set. Other phenotypes that are found to be enriched in the data set include dental and sensory perception-related phenotypes, features which are known to differ between humans and other apes. The analysis provides several likely candidates, either genes or regulatory regions, which may be involved in the processes that differentiate humans from other apes."

Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) can develop an immune disease similar to human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Immunosuppressed patients often suffer from opportunistic diseases such as microsporidiosis and cryptosporidiosis. We report on the occurrence of infections with microsporidia and Cryptosporidium spp. in wild-living chimpanzees, gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), bonobos (Pan paniscus), and four monkey species from the Cercopithecinae subfamily (Cercocebus agilis, Cercopithecus cephus, Cercopithecus nictitans, and Lophocebus albigena) and assess whether these infections may be good indicators of SIV-related immunosuppression. We analyzed 399 fecal samples collected in Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo for the presence of cross-reactive HIV antibodies using a line immunoassay (INNO-LIAA (R)). We amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) a 200-500 bp DNA fragment for the genus Encephalitozoon and the genus Enterocytozoon respectively (microsporidia), and an 820 bp DNA fragment of various Cryptosporidium species. Twenty-nine percent (45/155) of the chimpanzees samples analyzed were SIV+, whereas samples from the other primate species were SIV-. Phylogenetic analyses showed that 11 fecal samples [one SIV+, four SIV- chimpanzees, three gorillas, a bonobo, an agile mangabey (Cercocebus agilis), and a moustached monkey (Cercopithecus cephus)] are infected with microsporidia. DNA sequences of amplicons derived from eight fecal samples clustered together with Encephalitozoon hellem and three branched close to E. intestinalis. We also amplified Cryptosporidium spp. in two SIV+ chimpanzee samples and in two gorilla samples. We found no significant association between SIV infection status in chimpanzees and the presence of microsporidia or Cryptosporidium, suggesting that detection of microsporidia and Cryptosporidium is not a reliable marker for immunosuppressive status in SIV-infected primates."
A neonatal perspective on Homo erectus brain growth,"['Cofran, Z', 'DeSilva, JM']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.02.011,APR 2015,0,"The Mojokerto calvaria has been central to assessment of brain growth in Homo erectus, but different analytical approaches and uncertainty in the specimen's age at death have hindered consensus on the nature of H. erectus brain growth. We simulate average annual rites (AR) of absolute endocranial volume (ECV) growth and proportional size change (PSC) in H. erectus, utilizing estimates of H. erectus neonatal ECV and a range of ages for Mojokerto. These values are compared with resampled ARs and PSCs from ontogenetic series of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas from birth to six years. Results are consistent with other studies of ECV growth in extant taxa. There is extensive overlap in PSC between all living species through the first postnatal year, with continued but lesser overlap between humans and chimpanzees to age six. Human ARs are elevated above those of apes, although there is modest overlap up to 0.50 years. Ape ARs overlap throughout the sequence, with gorillas slightly elevated over chimpanzees up to 0.50 years. Simulated H. erectus PSCs can be found in all living species by 0.50 years, and the median falls below the human and chimpanzee ranges after 2.5 years. H. erectus ARs are elevated above those of all extant taxa prior to 0.50 years, and after two years they fall out of the human range but are still above ape ranges. A review of evidence for the age at death of Mojokerto supports an estimate of around one year, indicating absolute brain growth rates in the lower half of the human range. These results point to secondary altriciality in H. erectus, implying that key human adaptations for increasing the energy budget of females may have been established by at least 1 Ma.

Complete Genome Sequence of Pig-Tailed Macaque Rhadinovirus 2 and Its Evolutionary Relationship with Rhesus Macaque Rhadinovirus and Human Herpesvirus 8/Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus,"['Bruce, AG', 'Thouless, ME', 'Haines, AS', 'Pallen, MJ', 'Grundhoff, A', 'Rose, TM']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.03597-14,APR 2015,0,"Two rhadinovirus lineages have been identified in Old World primates. The rhadinovirus 1 (RV1) lineage consists of human herpesvirus 8, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and closely related rhadinoviruses of chimpanzees, gorillas, macaques and other Old World primates. The RV2 rhadinovirus lineage is distinct and consists of closely related viruses from the same Old World primate species. Rhesus macaque rhadinovirus (RRV) is the RV2 prototype, and two RRV isolates, 26-95 and 17577, were sequenced. We determined that the pig-tailed macaque RV2 rhadinovirus, MneRV2, is highly associated with lymphomas in macaques with simian AIDS. To further study the role of rhadinoviruses in the development of lymphoma, we sequenced the complete genome of MneRV2 and identified 87 protein coding genes and 17 candidate microRNAs (miRNAs). A strong genome colinearity and sequence homology were observed between MneRV2 and RRV26-95, although the open reading frame (ORF) encoding the KSHV ORFK15 homolog was disrupted in RRV26-95. Comparison with MneRV2 revealed several genomic anomalies in RRV17577 that were not present in other rhadinovirus genomes, including an N-terminal duplication in ORF4 and a recombinative exchange of more distantly related homologs of the ORF22/ORF47 interacting glycoprotein genes. The comparison with MneRV2 has revealed novel genes and important conservation of protein coding domains and transcription initiation, termination, and splicing signals, which have added to our knowledge of RV2 rhadinovirus genetics. Further comparisons with KSHV and other RV1 rhadinoviruses will provide important avenues for dissecting the biology, evolution, and pathology of these closely related tumor-inducing viruses in humans and other Old World primates.

IMPORTANCE

This work provides the sequence characterization of MneRV2, the pig-tailed macaque homolog of rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV). MneRV2 and RRV belong to the rhadinovirus 2 (RV2) rhadinovirus lineage of Old World primates and are distinct but related to Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma. Pig-tailed macaques provide important models of human disease, and our previous studies have indicated that MneRV2 plays a causal role in AIDS-related lymphomas in macaques. Delineation of the MneRV2 sequence has allowed a detailed characterization of the genome structure, and evolutionary comparisons with RRV and KSHV have identified conserved promoters, splice junctions, and novel genes. This comparison provides insight into RV2 rhadinovirus biology and sets the groundwork for more intensive next-generation (NextGen) transcript and genetic analysis of this class of tumor-inducing herpesvirus. This study supports the use of MneRV2 in pigtailed macaques as an important model for studying rhadinovirus biology, transmission and pathology."
High-sensitivity and high-Q-factor glass photonic crystal cavity and its applications as sensors,"['Siraji, AA', 'Zhao, Y']",OPTICS LETTERS,10.1364/OL.40.001508,APR 1 2015,1,We investigate the properties of a planar photonic crystal cavity on glass and its applications as sensors. An airbridged twofold defect cavity on Schott glass background and Gorilla glass substrate has been designed for high Q-factor up to 4459. The average sensitivity of the cavity resonance to background refractive index is 388 nm/Refractive Index Unit. The resonant wavelength is sensitive to background temperature by 18.5 pm/degrees C. The designed sensors show much higher sensitivity than those based on waveguide interferometers or photonic bandgap structures without cavity resonance. The results are also useful for experimental studies of glass photonic devices. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America
Mitochondrial tRNA-lookalikes in nuclear chromosomes: Could they be functional?,"['Telonis, AG', 'Kirino, Y', 'Rigoutsos, I']",RNA BIOLOGY,10.1080/15476286.2015.1017239,APR 2015,1,"The presence in human nuclear chromosomes of multiple sequences that are highly similar to human mitochondrial tRNAs (tRNA-lookalikes) raises intriguing questions about the possible functionality of these genomic loci. In this perspective, we explore the significance of the mitochondrial tRNA-lookalikes based on a series of properties that argue for their non-accidental nature. We particularly focus on the possibility of transcription as well as on potential functional roles for these sequences that can range from their acting as DNA regulatory elements to forming functional mature tRNAs or tRNA-derived fragments. Extension of our analysis to other simians (chimp, gorilla, rhesus, and squirrel monkey), 2 rodents (mouse and rat), a marsupial (opossum) and 3 invertebrates (fruit-fly, worm, and sponge) revealed that mitochondrial tRNA-lookalikes are prevalent in primates and the opossum but absent from the other analyzed organisms."
Age-dependent cognitive inflexibility in great apes,"['Manrique, HM', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.01.002,APR 2015,1,"The ability to suppress and/or change behaviour on the basis of negative feedback, often conceptualized as cognitive flexibility, has rarely been investigated in nonhuman great apes across a broad age range. In this study, 25 chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, eight bonobos, Pan paniscus, seven orang-utans, Pongo abelii, and three gorillas, Gorilla gorilla, whose ages ranged from 5 to 48 years, were presented with a transparent Plexiglas rectangular box horizontally attached to their cage mesh. A square container, 7.5 cm(2), fixed inside the apparatus contained a food reward (i.e. a grape). While the container rested on its central position the grape was not accessible. To retrieve the grape the subjects needed to grasp the handle connected to the reward container and displace it sideways to reach one of the lateral access windows. Subjects were intensively trained to displace the handle to a specific side (right or left, depending on the group) and then the rewarded side was reversed during the test. Performance in this reversal task did not differ significantly between species. However, a U-shaped relation between age and perseverative responding (i.e. moves to the previously rewarded side) was observed, extending findings with humans to our closest living primate relatives.

"Behavioural Ecology and Group Cohesion of Juvenile Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla) during Rehabilitation in the Bateke Plateaux National Park, Gabon","['Le Flohic, G', 'Motsch, P', 'DeNys, H', 'Childs, S', 'Courage, A', 'King, T']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0119609,MAR 26 2015,0,"Rehabilitation of animals followed by reintroduction into the wild can benefit conservation by supplementing depleted wild populations or reintroducing a species in an area where it has been extirpated or become extinct. The western lowland gorilla (WLG, Gorilla g. gorilla) is persistently poached; infants are often illegally traded and used as pets. Some are confiscated and rehabilitated, then kept in sanctuaries or reintroduced into the wild. Prior to reintroduction, the ability of the orphans to survive independently in their environment needs to be assessed. Here, we performed a multivariate analysis, including diet composition, activity-budget, and pattern of strata using of a group of five juvenile WLG in the process of rehabilitation and distinguished three sub-periods of ecological significance: the high furgivory period, the Dialium fruits consumption period, and the high folivory period. The consequences of these variations on their well-being (play behaviour) and the group cohesion (spatial proximity and social interactions) were examined. Like wild WLGs, diets shifted seasonally from frugivorous to folivorous, while the same staple foods were consumed and large amounts of Dialium fruits were seasonally gathered high in trees. When succulent fruit intake was the highest, thus providing high energy from sugar, juveniles spent less time feeding, more time playing and group cohesion was the highest. Conversely, the cohesion decreased with increasing folivory, individuals spent more time feeding and less time playing together. Nonetheless, the group cohesion also decreased after the death of one highly social, wild-born orphan. This may underscore the importance of skilled individuals in the cohesion and well-being of the entire group and, ultimately, to rehabilitation success. This study evaluates the rehabilitation success with regards to the methods used and highlights the need to consider a set of individual and environmental factors for enhancing rehabilitation while preserving the local biodiversity and individual well-being."
De Novo Origin of VCY2 from Autosome to Y-Transposed Amplicon,"['Cao, PR', 'Wang, L', 'Jiang, YC', 'Yi, YS', 'Qu, F', 'Liu, TC', 'Lv, Y']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0119651,MAR 23 2015,0,"The formation of new genes is a primary driving force of evolution in all organisms. The de novo evolution of new genes from non-protein-coding genomic regions is emerging as an important additional mechanism for novel gene creation. Y chromosomes underlie sex determination in mammals and contain genes that are required for male-specific functions. In this study, a search was undertaken for Y chromosome de novo genes derived from non-protein-coding sequences. The Y chromosome orphan gene variable charge, Y-linked (VCY) 2, is an autosome-derived gene that has sequence similarity to large autosomal fragments but lacks an autosomal protein-coding homolog. VCY2 locates in the amplicon containing long DNA fragments that were transposed from autosomes to the Y chromosome before the ape-monkey split. We confirmed that VCY2cannot be encoded by autosomes due to the presence of multiple disablers that disrupt the open reading frame, such as the absence of start or stop codons and the presence of premature stop codons. Similar observations have been made for homologs in the autosomes of the chimpanzee, gorilla, rhesus macaque, baboon and out-group marmoset, which suggests that there was a non-protein-coding ancestral VCY2 that was common to apes and monkeys that predated the transposition event. Furthermore, while protein-coding orthologs are absent, a putative non-protein-coding VCY2 with conserved disablers was identified in the rhesus macaque Y chromosome male-specific region. This finding implies that VCY2 might have not acquired its protein-coding ability before the ape-monkey split. VCY2 encodes a testis-specific expressed protein and is involved in the pathologic process of male infertility, and the acquisition of this gene might improve male fertility. This is the first evidence that de novo genes can be generated from transposed autosomal non-protein-coding segments, and this evidence provides novel insights into the evolutionary history of the Y chromosome."
Trabecular Architecture of the Manual Elements Reflects Locomotor Patterns in Primates,"['Matarazzo, SA']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0120436,MAR 20 2015,0,"The morphology of trabecular bone has proven sensitive to loading patterns in the long bones and metacarpal heads of primates. It is expected that we should also see differences in the manual digits of primates that practice different methods of locomotion. Primate proximal and middle phalanges are load-bearing elements that are held in different postures and experience different mechanical strains during suspension, quadrupedalism, and knuckle walking. Micro CT scans of the middle phalanx, proximal phalanx and the metacarpal head of the third ray were used to examine the pattern of trabecular orientation in Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, Hylobates and Macaca. Several zones, i.e., the proximal ends of both phalanges and the metacarpal heads, were capable of distinguishing between knuckle-walking, quadrupedal, and suspensory primates. Orientation and shape seem to be the primary distinguishing factors but differences in bone volume, isotropy index, and degree of anisotropy were seen across included taxa. Suspensory primates show primarily proximodistal alignment in all zones, and quadrupeds more palmar-dorsal orientation in several zones. Knuckle walkers are characterized by having proximodistal alignment in the proximal ends of the phalanges and a palmar-dorsal alignment in the distal ends and metacarpal heads. These structural differences may be used to infer locmotor propensities of extinct primate taxa."
Orangutans modify facial displays depending on recipient attention,"['Waller, BM', 'Caeiro, CC', 'Davila-Ross, M']",PEERJ,10.7717/peerj.827,MAR 19 2015,1,"Primate facial expressions are widely accepted as underpinned by reflexive emotional processes and not under voluntary control. In contrast, other modes of primate communication, especially gestures, are widely accepted as underpinned by intentional, goal-driven cognitive processes. One reason for this distinction is that production of primate gestures is often sensitive to the attentional state of the recipient, a phenomenon used as one of the key behavioural criteria for identifying intentionality in signal production. The reasoning is that modifying/producing a signal when a potential recipient is looking could demonstrate that the sender intends to communicate with them. Here, we show that the production of a primate facial expression can also be sensitive to the attention of the play partner. Using the orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) Facial Action Coding System(OrangFACS), we demonstrate that facial movements are more intense and more complex when recipient attention is directed towards the sender. Therefore, production of the playface is not an automated response to play (or simply a play behaviour itself) and is instead produced flexibly depending on the context. If sensitivity to attentional stance is a good indicator of intentionality, we must also conclude that the orangutan playface is intentionally produced. However, a number of alternative, lower level interpretations for flexible production of signals in response to the attention of another are discussed. As intentionality is a key feature of human language, claims of intentional communication in related primate species are powerful drivers in language evolution debates, and thus caution in identifying intentionality is important."
Adenovirus and Herpesvirus Diversity in Free-Ranging Great Apes in the Sangha Region of the Republic of Congo,"['Seimon, TA', 'Olson, SH', 'Lee, KJ', 'Rosen, G', 'Ondzie, A', 'Cameron, K', 'Reed, P', 'Anthony, SJ', 'Joly, DO', 'McAloose, D', 'Lipkin, WI']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0118543,MAR 17 2015,2,"Infectious diseases have caused die-offs in both free-ranging gorillas and chimpanzees. Understanding pathogen diversity and disease ecology is therefore critical for conserving these endangered animals. To determine viral diversity in free-ranging, non-habituated gorillas and chimpanzees in the Republic of Congo, genetic testing was performed on great-ape fecal samples collected near Odzala-Kokoua National Park. Samples were analyzed to determine ape species, identify individuals in the population, and to test for the presence of herpesviruses, adenoviruses, poxviruses, bocaviruses, flaviviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We identified 19 DNA viruses representing two viral families, Herpesviridae and Adenoviridae, of which three herpesviruses had not been previously described. Co-detections of multiple herpesviruses and/or adenoviruses were present in both gorillas and chimpanzees. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and lymphocryptovirus (LCV) were found primarily in the context of co-association with each other and adenoviruses. Using viral discovery curves for herpesviruses and adenoviruses, the total viral richness in the sample population of gorillas and chimpanzees was estimated to be a minimum of 23 viruses, corresponding to a detection rate of 83%. These findings represent the first description of DNA viral diversity in feces from free-ranging gorillas and chimpanzees in or near the Odzala-Kokoua National Park and form a basis for understanding the types of viruses circulating among great apes in this region."

Although groups M and N have been traced to geographically distinct chimpanzee communities in southern Cameroon, the reservoirs of groups O and P remain unknown. Here, we screened fecal samples fromwestern lowland (n = 2,611), eastern lowland (n = 103), and mountain (n = 218) gorillas for gorilla SIV (SIVgor) antibodies and nucleic acids. Despite testing wild troops throughout southern Cameroon (n = 14), northern Gabon (n = 16), the Democratic Republic of Congo (n = 2), and Uganda (n = 1), SIVgor was identified at only four sites in southern Cameroon, with prevalences ranging from 0.8-22%. Amplification of partial and full-length SIVgor sequences revealed extensive genetic diversity, but all SIVgor strains were derived from a single lineage within the chimpanzee SIV (SIVcpz) radiation. Two fully sequenced gorilla viruses from southwestern Cameroon were very closely related to, and likely represent the source population of, HIV-1 group P. Most of the genome of a third SIVgor strain, from central Cameroon, was very closely related to HIV-1 group O, again pointing to gorillas as the immediate source. Functional analyses identified the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G as a barrier for chimpanzee-to-gorilla, but not gorilla-to-human, virus transmission. These data indicate that HIV-1 group O, which spreads epidemically in west central Africa and is estimated to have infected around 100,000 people, originated by cross-species transmission from western lowland gorillas."

The recent development of non-invasive methods allowed re-exploration of plasmodial diversity in African apes. Although a large number of great ape populations have now been studied regarding Plasmodium infections in Africa, there are still vast areas of their distribution that remained unexplored. Gabon constitutes an important part of the range of western central African great ape subspecies (Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla), but has not been studied so far. In the present study, the diversity of Plasmodium species circulating in great apes in Gabon was analysed.

Methods: The analysis of 1,261 faecal samples from 791 chimpanzees and 470 gorillas collected from 24 sites all over Gabon was performed. Plasmodium infections were characterized by amplification and sequencing of a portion of the Plasmodium cytochrome b gene.

Results: The analysis of the 1,261 samples revealed that at least six Plasmodium species circulate in great apes in Gabon (Plasmodium praefalciparum, Plasmodium gorA (syn Plasmodium adleri), Plasmodium gorB (syn Plasmodium blacklocki) in gorillas and Plasmodium gaboni, P. reichenowi and Plasmodium billcollinsi in chimpanzees). No new phylogenetic lineages were discovered. The average infection rate was 21.3% for gorillas and 15.4% for chimpanzees. A logistic regression showed that the probability of infection was significantly dependent on the freshness of the droppings but not of the host species or of the average pluviometry of the months of collection."
The role of invasive trophoblast in implantation and placentation of primates,"['Carter, AM', 'Enders, AC', 'Pijnenborg, R']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2014.0070,MAR 5 2015,8,"We here review the evolution of invasive placentation in primates towards the deep penetration of the endometrium and its arteries in hominoids. The strepsirrhine primates (lemurs and lorises) have non-invasive, epitheliochorial placentation, although this is thought to be derived from a more invasive type. In haplorhine primates, there is differentiation of trophoblast at the blastocyst stage into syncytial and cellular trophoblast. Implantation involves syncytiotrophoblast that first removes the uterine epithelium then consolidates at the basal lamina before continuing into the stroma. In later stages of pregnancy, especially in Old World monkeys and apes, cytotrophoblast plays a greater role in the invasive process. Columns of trophoblast cells advance to the base of the implantation site where they spread out to forma cytotrophoblastic shell. In addition, cytotrophoblasts advance into the lumen of the spiral arteries. They are responsible for remodelling these vessels to form wide, low-resistance conduits. In human and great apes, there is additional invasion of the endometrium and its vessels by trophoblasts originating from the base of the anchoring villi. Deep trophoblast invasion that extends remodelling of the spiral arteries to segments in the inner myometrium evolved in the common ancestor of gorilla, chimp and human."
Neutralization Properties of Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses Infecting Chimpanzees and Gorillas,"['Barbian, HJ', 'Decker, JM', 'Bibollet-Ruche, F', 'Galimidi, RP', 'West, AP', 'Learn, GH', 'Parrish, NF', 'Iyer, SS', 'Li, YY', 'Pace, CS', 'Song, RJ', 'Huang, YX', 'Denny, TN', 'Mouquet, H', 'Martin, L', 'Acharya, P', 'Zhang, BS', 'Kwong, PD', 'Mascola, JR', 'Verrips, CT', 'Strokappe, NM', 'Rutten, L', 'McCoy, LE', 'Weiss, RA', 'Brown, CS', 'Jackson, R', 'Silvestri, G', 'Connors, M', 'Burton, DR', 'Shaw, GM', 'Nussenzweig, MC', 'Bjorkman, PJ', 'Ho, DD', 'Farzan, M', 'Hahn, BH', 'CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS']",MBIO,10.1128/mBio.00296-15,MAR-APR 2015,0,"Broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies (bNabs) represent powerful tools to combat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Here, we examined whether HIV-1-specific bNabs are capable of cross-neutralizing distantly related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting central (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) (SIVcpzPtt) and eastern (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) (SIVcpzPts) chimpanzees (n = 11) as well as western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) (SIVgor) (n = 1). We found that bNabs directed against the CD4 binding site (n = 10), peptidoglycans at the base of variable loop 3 (V3) (n = 5), and epitopes at the interface of surface (gp120) and membrane-bound (gp41) envelope glycoproteins (n = 5) failed to neutralize SIVcpz and SIVgor strains. In addition, apex V2-directed bNabs (n = 3) as well as llama-derived (heavy chain only) antibodies (n = 6) recognizing both the CD4 binding site and gp41 epitopes were either completely inactive or neutralized only a fraction of SIVcpzPtt strains. In contrast, one antibody targeting the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of gp41 (10E8), functional CD4 and CCR5 receptor mimetics (eCD4-Ig, eCD4-Ig(mim2), CD4-218.3-E51, and CD4-218.3-E51-mim2), as well as mono-and bispecific anti-human CD4 (iMab and LM52) and CCR5 (PRO140, PRO140-10E8) receptor antibodies neutralized >90% of SIVcpz and SIVgor strains with low-nanomolar (0.13 to 8.4 nM) potency. Importantly, the latter antibodies blocked virus entry not only in TZM-bl cells but also in Cf2Th cells expressing chimpanzee CD4 and CCR5 and neutralized SIVcpz in chimpanzee CD4(+) T cells, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) ranging from 3.6 to 40.5 nM. These findings provide new insight into the protective capacity of anti-HIV-1 bNabs and identify candidates for further development to combat SIVcpz infection.

IMPORTANCE SIVcpz is widespread in wild-living chimpanzees and can cause AIDS-like immunopathology and clinical disease. HIV-1 infection of humans can be controlled by antiretroviral therapy; however, treatment of wild-living African apes with current drug regimens is not feasible. Nonetheless, it may be possible to curb the spread of SIVcpz in select ape communities using vectored immunoprophylaxis and/or therapy. Here, we show that antibodies and antibody-like inhibitors developed to combat HIV-1 infection in humans are capable of neutralizing genetically diverse SIVcpz and SIVgor strains with considerable breadth and potency, including in primary chimpanzee CD4(+) T cells. These reagents provide an important first step toward translating intervention strategies currently developed to treat and prevent AIDS in humans to SIV-infected apes."

Differences in dung beetle activity at western gorilla defecation sites in south-east Cameroon: implications for establishment of Uapaca spp. seedlings,"['Petre, CA', 'Zinque, MH', 'Tagg, N', 'Beudels-Jamar, RC', 'Haurez, B', 'Josso, JF', 'Moretto, P', 'Doucet, JL']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,10.1017/S0266467414000753,MAR 2015,2,"For endozoochorous seed dispersal systems, the extant dung beetle assemblage at seed deposition sites may influence site suitability as burial activity may change the probability that seeds germinate and seedlings establish. This study tested if the different conditions of the two main seed-deposition habitats of a western lowland gorilla population of south-east Cameroon (sleeping sites and old secondary forest) influenced dung beetle assemblages and consequently the seed relocation patterns. In March 2012, in both habitats, burial patterns (proportion and depth) were described in eight stations based on two 300-g experimental faeces with known number of Uapaca spp. seeds (N = 75) left for 48 h, and beetle assemblages were described based on one 48h-dung-baited pitfall trapping session in five of these stations. To assess the impact of burial pattern on seedling emergence, Uapaca seedling emergence trials were performed in a nursery (75 seeds per depth treatment). Assemblage at sleeping sites had a higher species richness (non-significant) and was significantly more abundant than in old secondary forests. Conversely, significantly more seeds were buried in old secondary forests than sleeping sites and at significantly greater depths (mean: 14.9 cm vs. 8.7 cm). As trials suggested that burial depth >= 7 cm prevented Uapaca seedling emergence, dung beetles are assumed to induce seed loss more strongly in old secondary forests than sleeping sites (20.5% vs. 6.7% of initial seed crop). The demonstration that dung beetles may exert a negative influence on seed fate overall, and that the degree to which this occurs may vary depending on habitat, highlights the complexity in determining the suitability of deposition sites for recruitment."
Dietary differences have contrasting effects on the seed dispersal potential of the titi monkey Callicebus coimbrai in north-eastern Brazil,"['Baiao, SAA', 'Correia, FBA', 'Ferrari, SF']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,10.1017/S0266467414000649,MAR 2015,0,"Gut transit times and dispersal distances of seeds ingested by Callicebus coimbrai at two localities were estimated by tracing seeds found in faeces to feeding sites. Feeding events and faecal samples were recorded/collected and mapped by GPS between April and July, 2012. Junco group fed almost exclusively on fruit, whereas Trapsa group fed on fruit and leaves/flowers in similar proportions. A much higher proportion of faecal samples from Junco contained seeds ( 47.9%, n = 244, vs. 33.6%, n = 177), and contained more seeds, on average (3.0 +/- 2.8 vs. 2.1 +/- 2.1) than those from Trapsa. However, gut transit times were absolutely longer at Trapsa ( mean = 4.87 +/- 1.48 h, n = 6, vs. 2.85 +/- 0.53 h, n = 13 daytime events), and dispersal distances were significantly longer ( 200 +/- 81.0 m vs. 126 +/- 53.4 m). The evidence indicates that, while the more folivorous diet at Trapsa was reflected in a much lower faecal seed count, it was also associated with longer gut transit times, and significantly longer dispersal distances, i.e. while dispersing approximately half the seeds dispersed by Junco group, Trapsa group dispersed these seeds over almost twice the distance."
How much more would KNM-WT 15000 have grown?,"['Ruff, CB', 'Burgess, ML']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.09.005,MAR 2015,3,"Because of its completeness, the juvenile Homo ergaster/erectus KNM-WT 15000 has played an important role in studies of the evolution of body form in Homo. Early attempts to estimate his adult body size used modern human growth models. However, more recent evidence, particularly from the dentition, suggests that he may have had a more chimpanzee-like growth trajectory. Here we re-estimate his adult stature and body mass using ontogenetic data derived from four African ape taxa: Pan troglodytes troglodytes, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, Pan paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla gorilla. The average percentage change in femoral and tibial lengths and femoral head breadth between individuals at the same stage of dental development as KNM-WT 15000 - eruption of M2s but not M3s and adult individuals with fully fused long bone epiphyses, was determined. Results were then applied to KNM-WT 15000, and his adult size estimated from skeletal dimensions using modem human prediction formulae. Using this approach, adult stature best estimates of 176-180 cm and body mass best estimates of 80-83 kg were obtained. These estimates are close to those estimated directly from longitudinal changes in body length and body mass between 8 and 12 years of age in chimpanzees, the suggested chronological equivalent to KNM-WT 15000's remaining growth period. Thus, even using an African ape growth model, it is likely that KNM-WT 15000 would have attained close to 180 cm in stature (without a slight reduction for his lower cranial height) and 80 kg in body mass as an adult. Other evidence from the East African Early Pleistocene indicates that KNM-WT 15000 was not unusually large-bodied for his time period. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Rotator cuff muscle size and the interpretation of scapular shape in primates,"['Larson, SG']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.01.001,MAR 2015,3,"Scapular shape variation among primates is widely viewed as being strongly related to locomotor differences. The relative importance of overhead forelimb elevation in the locomotor repertoire of a species, as reflected in muscular leverage for scapular rotation or in the sizes of attachment areas for muscles involved in glenohumeral elevation, has proven to be a useful organizing principle for understanding this variation. While generally successful in sorting primate scapulae into functional groups, the scapulae of some species do not entirely match predictions based on the perceived importance of forelimb elevation. A recent study has shown that scapular fossa sizes in apes are not as accurate predictors of the sizes of the muscles arising from them as has been assumed. To further explore the degree of correspondence between actual and predicted muscle size based on the perceived importance of forelimb elevation, the current study examines the relative sizes of the rotator cuff muscles in a wider sample of primate taxa using published data on muscle mass and cross-sectional area. The results do not support some of the accepted generalizations about the relative sizes of members of the rotator cuff based on measurements of the sizes of scapular fossae. For example, orthograde apes do not display enlarged supraspinatus muscles compared to pronograde monkeys. Differences in assessments of relative muscle size based on mass compared to those based on cross-sectional area suggest that poor correspondence between muscle size predicted from scapular fossa size and actual muscle size may be related to constraints on scapular form associated with muscular leverage for scapular rotation and with scapular position on the thorax.

A sub-epidemic of subtype F with specific characteristics and low response to treatment has been recently identified in Galicia. In this study we investigated the characteristics of the HIV-1 subtype F sub-epidemic in A Coruna and Santiago de Compostela in Northwest Spain.

Methods: 420 newly HIV-1 diagnosed patients during 2009-2013 were enrolled in this study. HIV-1 subtyping was carried out using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetic analysis. Molecular epidemiology investigation of subtypes B and F was performed by means of phylogenetic analysis using fast maximum likelihood. Phylodynamic analysis was performed using Bayesian method as implemented in BEAST v1.8.

Results: Subtype B found to be the predominant (61.2% and 70.4%) followed by subtype F (25.6% and 12.0%) in both areas (A Coruna and Santiago de Compostela, respectively). The latter found to mainly spread among men having sex with men (MSM). The vast majority of subtype F lineages from both areas clustered monophyletically, while subtype B sequences clustered in several tree branches. The exponential growth of subtype F sub-epidemic dated back in 2008 by means of phylodynamic analysis. Most of new infections during 2009-2013 occurred within the subtype F transmission cluster.

Conclusions: Subtype F circulates at high prevalence in A Coruna and Santiago de Compostela in Northwest Spain, suggesting that the HIV-1 epidemic in this region has distinct characteristics to the rest of Spain. Subtype F has being spreading among MSM and is currently the most actively spreading network. The single cluster spread of this local sub-epidemic might provide an explanation for the distinct characteristics and the low response to antiretroviral treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Examination of genomic variation within great apes offers many opportunities to increase our understanding of the forces that have differentially shaped the evolutionary history of hominid taxa. Here, we expand upon the work of the Great Ape Genome Project by analyzing medium to high coverage whole-genome sequences from 14 western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), 2 eastern lowland gorillas (G. beringei graueri), and a single Cross River individual (G. gorilla diehli). We infer that the ancestors of western and eastern lowland gorillas diverged from a common ancestor approximately 261 ka, and that the ancestors of the Cross River population diverged from the western lowland gorilla lineage approximately 68 ka. Using a diffusion approximation approach to model the genome-wide site frequency spectrum, we infer a history of western lowland gorillas that includes an ancestral population expansion of 1.4-fold around 970 ka and a recent 5.6-fold contraction in population size 23 ka. The latter may correspond to a major reduction in African equatorial forests around the Last Glacial Maximum. We also analyze patterns of variation among western lowland gorillas to identify several genomic regions with strong signatures of recent selective sweeps. We find that processes related to taste, pancreatic and saliva secretion, sodium ion transmembrane transport, and cardiac muscle function are overrepresented in genomic regions predicted to have experienced recent positive selection."
Modified fields' stain: ideal to differentiate Dientamoeba fragilis and Blastocystis sp.,"['Ragavan, AD', 'Govind, SK']",PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH,10.1007/s00436-014-4296-8,MAR 2015,0,"Dientamoeba fragilis, a trichomonad parasite is usually found in the gastrointestinal tract of human, and it is known to be the cause for gastrointestinal disease. The parasite is globally distributed and mostly found in rural and urban areas. The parasite is found in humans and nonhuman primates such as the macaques, baboons, and gorillas. Often, the parasite is confused with another largely found organism in stools called Blastocystis sp. especially when seen directly under light microscopy on culture samples containing both parasites. Both sometimes are seen with two nuclei with sizes tending to be similar which complicates identification. Stools were collected fresh from nine previously diagnosed persons infected with D. fragilis who also were found to be positive for Blastocystis sp. Samples were then cultured in Loeffler's medium and were stained with Giemsa, iron hematoxylin, and modified Fields' (MF) stain, respectively. D. fragilis was differentiated from Blastocystis sp. when stained with MF stain by the presence of a thinner outer membrane with clearly demarcated nuclei in the center of the cell whilst Blastocystis sp. had a darker and thicker stained outer membrane with the presence of two nuclei. The staining contrast was more evident with modified Fields' stain when compared with the other two. The simplicity in preparing the stain as well as the speed of the staining procedure make MF stain an ideal alternate. The modified Fields' stain is faster and easier to prepare when compared to the other two stains. MF stain provides a better contrast differentiating the two organisms and therefore provides a more reliable diagnostic method to precisely identify one from the other especially when cultures show mixed infections."
Pathogenic Enterobacteria in Lemurs Associated With Anthropogenic Disturbance,"['Bublitz, DC', 'Wright, PC', 'Rasambainarivo, FT', 'Arrigo-Nelson, SJ', 'Bodager, JR', 'Gillespie, TR']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22348,MAR 2015,4,"As human population density continues to increase exponentially, speeding the reduction and fragmentation of primate habitat, greater human-primate contact is inevitable, making higher rates of pathogen transmission likely. Anthropogenic effects are particularly evident in Madagascar, where a diversity of endemic lemur species are threatened by rapid habitat loss. Despite these risks, knowledge of how anthropogenic activities affect lemur exposure to pathogens is limited. To improve our understanding of this interplay, we non-invasively examined six species of wild lemurs in Ranomafana National Park for enteric bacterial pathogens commonly associated with diarrheal disease in human populations in Madagascar. Patterns of infection with Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella enterica, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia spp. (enterocolitica and pseudotuberculosis) were compared between lemurs inhabiting intact forest and lemurs inhabiting degraded habitat with frequent exposure to tourism and other human activity. Fecal samples acquired from humans, livestock, and rodents living near the degraded habitat were also screened for these bacteria. Remarkably, only lemurs living in disturbed areas of the park tested positive for these pathogens. Moreover, all of these pathogens were present in the human, livestock, and/or rodent populations. These data suggest that lemurs residing in forests altered or frequented by people, livestock, or peridomestic rodents, are at risk for infection by these diarrhea-causing enterobacteria and other similarly transmitted pathogens.

Contextual correlates of syntactic variation in mountain and western gorilla close-distance vocalizations: Indications for lexical or phonological syntax?,"['Hedwig, D', 'Mundry, R', 'Robbins, MM', 'Boesch, C']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-014-0812-6,MAR 2015,1,"The core of the generative power of human languages lies in our ability to combine acoustic units under specific rules into structurally complex and semantically rich utterances. While various animal species concatenate acoustic units into structurally elaborate vocal sequences, such compound calls do not appear to be compositional as their information content cannot be derived from the information content of each of its components. As such, animal compound calls are said to constitute a form of phonological syntax, as in the construction of words in human language, whereas evidence for rudimentary forms of lexical syntax, analogous to the construction of sentences out of words, is scarce. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the repertoire of close-distance calls of mountain and western gorillas consists of acoustic units that are either used singularly or non-randomly combined. Here, we investigate whether this syntactic variation provides indications for lexical or phonological syntax. Specifically, we examined the differences between the potential information content of compound calls and their components used singularly through investigating the contexts in which they are used. We found that the gorillas emitted compound calls in contexts similar to some but not all components, but also in a context rarely found for any of their components. As such, the investigated compound calls did not appear to be compositional as their information content cannot be derived from the information content of each of their components. Our results suggest that combining acoustic units into compound vocalizations by gorillas constitutes a form of phonological syntax, which may enable them to increase the number of messages that can be transmitted by an otherwise small repertoire of acoustic units."

In Experiment 1, we examined whether people's tool preferences for retrieving an out-of-reach object in a tube might more closely resemble those reported with laboratory crows if people could modify a single stick to an ideal length to solve the problem. Contrary to when adult humans have selected a tool from a set of ten sticks, asking people to modify a single stick to retrieve an object did not generally result in a stick whose length was related to the object's distance. Consistent with the prior research, though, the working length of the stick was related to the object's distance. In Experiment 2, we examined the effect of increasing the scale of the stick-and-tube problem on people's tool preferences. Increasing the scale of the task influenced people to select relatively shorter tools than had selected in previous studies. Although the causal structures of the tasks used in the two experiments were identical, their results were not. This underscores the necessity of studying physical cognition in relation to a particular causal structure by using a variety of tasks and methods."
lncRNA-MFDL: identification of human long non-coding RNAs by fusing multiple features and using deep learning,"['Fan, XN', 'Zhang, SW']",MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS,10.1039/c4mb00650j,2015,2,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as a novel class of noncoding RNAs and potent gene regulators, which play an important and varied role in cellular functions. lncRNAs are closely related with the occurrence and development of some diseases. High-throughput RNA-sequencing techniques combined with de novo assembly have identified a large number of novel transcripts. The discovery of large and 'hidden' transcriptomes urgently requires the development of effective computational methods that can rapidly distinguish between coding and long noncoding RNAs. In this study, we developed a powerful predictor (named as lncRNA-MFDL) to identify lncRNAs by fusing multiple features of the open reading frame, k-mer, the secondary structure and the most-like coding domain sequence and using deep learning classification algorithms. Using the same human training dataset and a 10-fold cross validation test, lncRNA-MFDL can achieve 97.1% prediction accuracy which is 5.7, 3.7, and 3.4% higher than that of CPC, CNCI and lncRNA-FMFSVM predictors, respectively. Compared with CPC and CNCI predictors in other species (e.g., anole lizard, zebrafish, chicken, gorilla, macaque, mouse, lamprey, orangutan, xenopus and C. elegans) testing datasets, the new lncRNA-MFDL predictor is also much more effective and robust. These results show that lncRNA-MFDL is a powerful tool for identifying lncRNAs. The lncRNA-MFDL software package is freely available at http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/lncRNA_MDFL/for academic users."
Relationship between amino acid usage and amino acid evolution in primates,"['Liu, HX', 'Xie, ZQ', 'Tan, SJ', 'Zhang, XH', 'Yang, SH']",GENE,10.1016/j.gene.2014.12.033,FEB 25 2015,1,"Amino acid usage varies from species to species. A previous study has found a universal trend in amino acid gain and loss in many taxa and a one-way model of amino acid evolution in which the number of new amino acids increases as the number of old amino acids decreases was proposed. Later studies showed that this pattern of amino acid gain and loss is likely to be compatible with the neutral theory. The present work aimed to further study this problem by investigating the evolutionary patterns of amino acids in 8 primates (the nucleotide and protein alignments are available online http://gattaca.nju.edu.cn/pub_data.html). First, the number of amino acids gained and lost was calculated and the evolution trend of each amino acid was inferred. These values were found to be closely related to the usage of each amino acid. Then we analyzed the mutational trend of amino acid substitution in human using SNPs, this trend is highly correlated with fixation trend only with greater variance. Finally, the trends in the evolution of 20 amino adds were evaluated in human on different time scales, and the increasing rate of 5 significantly increasing amino acids was found to decrease as a function of time elapsed since divergence, and the dS/dN ratio also found to increase as a function of time elapsed since divergence. These results suggested that the observed amino acid substitution pattern is influenced by mutation and purifying selection. In conclusion, the present study shows that usage of amino acids is an important factor capable of influencing the observed pattern of amino acid evolution, and also presented evidences suggesting that the observed universal trend of amino acid gain and loss is compatible with neutral evolution.

Potent restriction of HIV-1 and SIVmac239 Replication by African Green Monkey TRIM5 alpha,"['Coren, LV', 'Trivett, MT', 'Jain, S', 'Ayala, VI', 'Del Prete, GQ', 'Ohlen, C', 'Ott, DE']",RETROVIROLOGY,10.1186/s12977-015-0137-9,FEB 7 2015,1,"Background: The TRIM5 alpha protein is a principal restriction factor that contributes to an HIV-1 replication block in rhesus macaque CD4(+) T cells by preventing reverse transcription. HIV-1 restriction is induced in human CD4(+) T cells by expression of rhesus TRIM5 alpha as well as those of other old world monkeys. While TRIM5 alpha restriction has been extensively studied in single-round infection assays, fewer studies have examined restriction after extended viral replication.

Results: To examine TRIM5 alpha restriction of replication, we studied the ability of TRIM5 alpha proteins from African green monkey (AgmTRIM5 alpha) and gorilla (gorTRIM5 alpha) to restrict HIV-1 and SIVmac239 replication. These xenogeneic TRIM5 alpha genes were transduced into human Jurkat-CCR5 cells (JR5), which were then exposed to HIV-1 or SIVmac239. In our single-round infection assays, AgmTRIM5 alpha showed a relatively modest 4- to 10-fold restriction of HIV-1 and SIVmac239, while gorTRIM5 alpha produced a 2- and 3-fold restriction of HIV-1 and SIVmac239, respectively, consistent with the majority of previously published single-round studies. To assess the impact of these modest effects on infection, we tested restriction in replication systems initiated with either cell-free or cell-to-cell challenges. AgmTRIM5 alpha powerfully restricted both HIV-1 and SIVmac239 replication 14 days after cell-free infection, with a >= 3-log effect. Moreover, expression of AgmTRIM5 alpha restricted HIV-1 and SIVmac239 replication by 2-logs when co-cultured with infected JR5 cells for 12 days. In contrast, neither expression of gorTRIM5 alpha nor rhesus TRIM5 alpha induced significant resistance when co-cultured with infected cells. Follow up experiments showed that the observed differences between replication and infection were not due to assembly defects as xenogeneic TRIM5 alpha expression had no effect on either virion production or specific infectivity.

Conclusions: Our results indicate that AgmTRIM5 alpha has a much greater effect on extended replication than on any single infection event, suggesting that AgmTRIM5 alpha restriction acts cumulatively, building up over many rounds of replication. Furthermore, AgmTRIM5 alpha was able to potently restrict both HIV-1 and SIV replication in a cell-to-cell infection challenge. Thus, AgmTRIM5 alpha is unique among the TRIM5 alpha species tested to date, being able to restrict even at the high multiplicities of infection presented by mixed culture with nonrestrictive infected cells."
Detection dog efficacy for collecting faecal samples from the critically endangered Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli) for genetic censusing.,"['Arandjelovic, Mimi', 'Bergl, Richard A', 'Ikfuingei, Romanus', 'Jameson, Christopher', 'Parker, Megan', 'Vigilant, Linda']",Royal Society open science,10.1098/rsos.140423,2015-Feb,0,"Population estimates using genetic capture-recapture methods from non-invasively collected wildlife samples are more accurate and precise than those obtained from traditional methods when detection and resampling rates are high. Recently, detection dogs have been increasingly used to find elusive species and their by-products. Here we compared the effectiveness of dog- and human-directed searches for Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli) faeces at two sites. The critically endangered Cross River gorilla inhabits a region of high biodiversity and endemism on the border between Nigeria and Cameroon. The rugged highland terrain and their cryptic behaviour make them difficult to study and a precise population size for the subspecies is still lacking. Dog-directed surveys located more fresh faeces with less bias than human-directed survey teams. This produced a more reliable population estimate, although of modest precision given the small scale of this pilot study. Unfortunately, the considerable costs associated with use of the United States-based detection dog teams make the use of these teams financially unfeasible for a larger, more comprehensive survey. To realize the full potential of dog-directed surveys and increase cost-effectiveness, we recommend basing dog-detection teams in the countries where they will operate and expanding the targets the dogs are trained to detect."
Commentary: is Alzheimer's disease uniquely human?,"['Finch, CE', 'Austad, SN']",NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.10.025,FEB 2015,4,"That Alzheimer's disease (AD) might be a human-specific disease was hypothesized by Rapoport in 1989. Apes and humans share an identical amyloid beta (A beta) peptide amino acid sequence and accumulate considerable A beta deposits after age 40 years, an age when amyloid plaques are uncommon in humans. Despite their early A beta buildup, ape brains have not shown evidence dystrophic neurites near plaques. Aging great ape brains also have few neurofibrillary tangles, with one exception of 1 obese chimpanzee euthanized after a stroke who displayed abundant neurofibrillary tangles, but without the typical AD distribution. We discuss the need for more exacting evaluation of neuron density with age, and note husbandry issues that may allow great apes to live to greater ages. We remain reserved about expectations for fully developed AD-like pathology in the great apes of advanced ages and cautiously support Rapoport's hypothesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Effect of laser beam scanning mode on material removal efficiency in laser ablation for micromachining of glass,"['Wang, ZK', 'Seow, WL', 'Wang, XC', 'Zheng, HY']",JOURNAL OF LASER APPLICATIONS,10.2351/1.4906475,FEB 2015,0,"This study investigated the influence of laser beam scanning mode on material removal efficiency through evaluation of cut-through time for a 5 mm length inside a glass substrate. The parameters related to the scanning mode covered scanning speed, focus position, number of lines and shifting pitch in one kerf, scanning under raster, merge or group mode, and scanning at fixed or nonfixed parameter mode. Picosecond, near infrared laser pulses were used to ablate a 700 mu m thick, nonion exchanged Gorilla glass at fluence of 9.0 J/cm(2) using a galvanometer scanner. It has been found that the optimal scanning speed for ablation without cracks and debris was above 200 mm/s, namely, only a few overlapped pulses in a single line scan. When ablation started from glass bottom, the ejected materials could efficiently escape from the ablation kerf and no ejected materials would disperse the laser energy deposition to the glass unlike ablation from the top surface. The cut-through time was 1.36 times and 24.5 times longer when focus was placed at the middle and top of the glass, respectively, compared to at bottom surface. The optimal number of lines was determined by the required kerf width of approximately half the glass thickness for high ablation efficiency. Ablated materials were not ejected out of the kerf efficiently at smaller kerf with fewer lines. Cut-through time was also increased at larger kerf with more lines due to more material removal. The optimal shifting pitch was found to be approximately a scanned line width which was close to the spot size in this study. Scanning under raster mode could achieve minimal cut-through time of 31.42 s. The cut-through time was increased by a factor of 1.51 times and 13.43 times, respectively, for merge and group mode. Merge and raster mode allowed layer by layer scanning with high material removal and the ablation was further enhanced by continuous line scanning in one ablation layer under raster mode. Ablation under fixed parameter mode could eliminate the call-procedure of laser parameters used in individual line scanning. The cut-through time was reduced by 86% compared to nonfixed parameter mode. (C) 2015 Laser Institute of America."
Lack of Correlation Between Fluctuating Asymmetry and Morphological Masculinity/Femininity in Primate Skulls,"['Van Dongen, S']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-015-9814-8,FEB 2015,1,"As both degree of masculinity/femininity in sexually dimorphic organisms and developmental instability are put forward as indicators of individual quality, they are expected to correlate positively. However, the results in the literature are equivocal. One reason may be that most research has been performed in populations exposed to relatively low levels of parasitism. This article studies associations between the degree of masculinity/femininity and the fluctuating asymmetry (a measure of developmental instability) of skulls of three primate species [baboon (Papio anubis), eastern lowland gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri), and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes)] collected in the wild. The exposure to infection and parasites is likely to be higher in these individuals compared to captive primates and humans, and therefore likely to increase the levels of association. While the degree of individual masculinity/femininity and levels of fluctuating asymmetry were quantified accurately, I found no evidence of an association between them. My results thus are in line with the conclusion of a recent meta-analysis, that there is little evidence for associations between masculinity/femininity and developmental instability."

Her mother was infected with a subtype B strain. These data confirm that hunters in Africa can be infected by HTLV-1 that is closely related to the strains circulating among local NHP game. Our findings strongly suggest that a severe bite represent a risk factor for STLV-1 acquisition."
"Epidemiology and Molecular Characterization of Cryptosporidium spp. in Humans, Wild Primates, and Domesticated Animals in the Greater Gombe Ecosystem, Tanzania","['Parsons, MB', 'Travis, D', 'Lonsdorf, EV', 'Lipende, I', 'Roellig, DMA', 'Kamenya, S', 'Zhang, HW', 'Xiao, LH', 'Gillespie, TR']",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,10.1371/journal.pntd.0003529,FEB 2015,1,"Cryptosporidium is an important zoonotic parasite globally. Few studies have examined the ecology and epidemiology of this pathogen in rural tropical systems characterized by high rates of overlap among humans, domesticated animals, and wildlife. We investigated risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection and assessed cross-species transmission potential among people, non-human primates, and domestic animals in the Gombe Ecosystem, Kigoma District, Tanzania. A cross-sectional survey was designed to determine the occurrence and risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection in humans, domestic animals and wildlife living in and around Gombe National Park. Diagnostic PCR revealed Cryptosporidium infection rates of 4.3% in humans, 16.0% in non-human primates, and 9.6% in livestock. Local streams sampled were negative. DNA sequencing uncovered a complex epidemiology for Cryptosporidium in this system, with humans, baboons and a subset of chimpanzees infected with C. hominis subtype IfA12G2; another subset of chimpanzees infected with C. suis; and all positive goats and sheep infected with C. xiaoi. For humans, residence location was associated with increased risk of infection in Mwamgongo village compared to one camp ( Kasekela), and there was an increased odds for infection when living in a household with another positive person. Fecal consistency and other gastrointestinal signs did not predict Cryptosporidium infection. Despite a high degree of habitat overlap between village people and livestock, our results suggest that there are distinct Cryptosporidium transmission dynamics for humans and livestock in this system. The dominance of C. hominis subtype IfA12G2 among humans and non-human primates suggest cross-species transmission. Interestingly, a subset of chimpanzees was infected with C. suis. We hypothesize that there is cross-species transmission from bush pigs (Potaochoerus larvatus) to chimpanzees in Gombe forest, since domesticated pigs are regionally absent. Our findings demonstrate a complex nature of Cryptosporidium in sympatric primates, including humans, and stress the need for further studies."
"Nonhuman Primate Communication, Pragmatics, and the Origins of Language","['Scott-Phillips, TC']",CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1086/679674,FEB 2015,2,"Comparisons with the cognition and communication of other species have long informed discussions of the origins and evolution of human communication and language. This research has often focused on similarities and differences with the linguistic code, but more recently there has been an increased focus on the social-cognitive foundations of linguistic communication. However, exactly what these comparisons tell us is not clear because the theoretical concepts used in the animal communication literature are different from those used in the corresponding literature on human communication, specifically those used in linguistic pragmatics. In this article, I bridge the gap between these two areas and in doing so specify exactly what great ape communication tells us about the origins of human communication and language. I conclude that great ape communication probably does not share the same social-cognitive foundations as linguistic communication but that it probably does involve the use of metacognitive abilities that, once they evolved to a more sophisticated degree, were exapted for use in what is an evolutionarily novel form of communication: human ostensive communication. This in turn laid the foundations for the emergence of linguistic communication. More generally, I highlight the often-neglected importance of pragmatics for the study of language origins."
Stability of the gorilla microbiome despite simian immunodeficiency virus infection,"['Moeller, AH', 'Peeters, M', 'Ayouba, A', 'Ngole, EM', 'Esteban, A', 'Hahn, BH', 'Ochman, H']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1111/mec.13057,FEB 2015,3,"Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) have been discovered in over 45 primate species; however, the pathogenic potential of most SIV strains remains unknown due to difficulties inherent in observing wild populations. Because those SIV infections that are pathogenic have been shown to induce changes in the host's gut microbiome, monitoring the microbiota present in faecal samples can provide a noninvasive means for studying the effects of SIV infection on the health of wild-living primates. Here, we examine the effects of SIVgor, a close relative of SIVcpz of chimpanzees and HIV-1 of humans, on the gut bacterial communities residing within wild gorillas, revealing that gorilla gut microbiomes are exceptionally robust to SIV infection. In contrast to the microbiomes of HIV-1-infected humans and SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees, SIVgor-infected gorilla microbiomes exhibit neither rises in the frequencies of opportunistic pathogens nor elevated rates of microbial turnover within individual hosts. Regardless of SIV infection status, gorilla microbiomes assort into enterotypes, one of which is compositionally analogous to those identified in humans and chimpanzees. The other gorilla enterotype appears specialized for a leaf-based diet and is enriched in environmentally derived bacterial genera. We hypothesize that the acquisition of this gorilla-specific enterotype was enabled by lowered immune system control over the composition of the microbiome. Our results indicate differences between the pathology of SIVgor and SIVcpz/HIV-1 infections, demonstrating the utility of investigating host microbial ecology as a means for studying disease in wild primates of high conservation priority."
Personality Dimensions and Their Behavioral Correlates in Wild Virunga Mountain Gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei),"['Eckardt, W', 'Steklis, HD', 'Steklis, NG', 'Fletcher, AW', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Weiss, A']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0038370,FEB 2015,1,"Studies of animal personality improve our understanding of individual variation in measures of life history and fitness, such as health and reproductive success. Using a 54 trait personality questionnaire developed for studying great apes and other nonhuman primates, we obtained ratings on 116 wild mountain gorillas ( Gorilla beringei beringei) monitored by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund's Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda. There were 8 raters who each had more than 1.5 years of working experience with the subjects. Principal component analyses identified 4 personality dimensions with high interrater reliabilities-Dominance, Openness, Sociability, and Proto-Agreeableness-that reflected personality features unique to gorillas and personality features shared with other hominoids. We next examined the associations of these dimensions with independently collected behavioral measures derived from long-term records. Predicted correlations were found between the personality dimensions and corresponding behaviors. For example, Dominance, Openness, Sociability, and Proto-Agreeableness were related to gorilla dominance strength, time spent playing, rates of approaches, and rates of interventions in intragroup conflicts, respectively. These findings enrich the comparative-evolutionary study of personality and provide insights into how species differences in personality are related to ecology, social systems, and life history."
Evolutionary fate of SVA2 elements in primate genomes,"['Kwak, Y', 'Kim, YJ', 'Xing, JC', 'Han, K']",GENES & GENOMICS,10.1007/s13258-014-0241-6,FEB 2015,2,"SVA (SINE/VNTR/Alu) transposable element, one of non-LTR retrotransposons, emerged in the primate genome about 25 million years ago. Currently, similar to 2,800 SVA copies exist in the human genome. Recently, a group of transposable elements named SVA2 is discovered. SVA2 elements share the VNTR region with the SVA element but do not contain the SINE-R region of the SVA elements. In this study, we studied the SVA2 evolution and the impact of the SVA2 elements on primate genomes. We first identified 144, 139, 136, 139, and 116 SVA2 elements in the human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and rhesus macaque genomes, respectively. To examine the evolutionary state and structure of the elements, we performed comparative genomics, comparing human SVA2 with its orthologous counterpart from non-human primates. The result suggests that SVA2 subfamily is not, at present, retrotranspositionally active in the primate genomes because none of the SVA2 elements identified in this study are species-specific. In addition, we found that four human SVA2 elements locate in human genes and two of them have miRNA target sites, indicating that they might regulate gene expression and involve in the gene-related human diseases."

Although anatomical, genetic, behavioral, and socioecological differences have been noted among gorilla populations, little is known about variation in their brain structure. This study examines neuroanatomical variation between gorilla species using structural neuroimaging. Postmortem magnetic resonance images were obtained of brains from 18 captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), 15 wild mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), and 3 Grauer's gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri) (both wild and captive). Stereologic methods were used to measure volumes of brain structures, including left and right frontal lobe gray and white matter, temporal lobe gray and white matter, parietal and occipital lobes gray and white matter, insular gray matter, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, each hemisphere and the vermis of the cerebellum, and the external and extreme capsules together with the claustrum. Among the species differences, the volumes of the hippocampus and cerebellum were significantly larger in G. gorilla than G. beringei. These anatomical differences may relate to divergent ecological adaptations of the two species. Specifically, G. gorilla engages in more arboreal locomotion and thus may rely more on cerebellar circuits. In addition, they tend to eat more fruit and have larger home ranges and consequently might depend more on spatial mapping functions of the hippocampus. Am J Phys Anthropol 156:252-262, 2015.

Sexual selection and the adaptive evolution of PKDREJ protein in primates and rodents,"['Vicens, A', 'Montoto, LG', 'Couso-Ferrer, F', 'Sutton, KA', 'Roldan, ERS']",MOLECULAR HUMAN REPRODUCTION,10.1093/molehr/gau095,FEB 2015,0,"PKDREJ is a testis-specific protein thought to be located on the sperm surface. Functional studies in the mouse revealed that loss of PKDREJ has effects on sperm transport and the ability to undergo an induced acrosome reaction. Thus, PKDREJ has been considered a potential target of post-copulatory sexual selection in the form of sperm competition. Proteins involved in reproductive processes often show accelerated evolution. In many cases, this rapid divergence is promoted by positive selection which may be driven, at least in part, by post-copulatory sexual selection. We analysed the evolution of the PKDREJ protein in primates and rodents and assessed whether PKDREJ divergence is associated with testes mass relative to body mass, which is a reliable proxy of sperm competition levels. Evidence of an association between the evolutionary rate of the PKDREJ gene and testes mass relative to body mass was not found in primates. Among rodents, evidence of positive selection was detected in the Pkdrej gene in the family Cricetidae but not in Muridae. We then assessed whether Pkdrej divergence is associated with episodes of sperm competition in these families. We detected a positive significant correlation between the evolutionary rates of Pkdrej and testes mass relative to body mass in cricetids. These findings constitute the first evidence of post-copulatory sexual selection influencing the evolution of a protein that participates in the mechanisms regulating sperm transport and the acrosome reaction, strongly suggesting that positive selection may act on these fertilization steps, leading to advantages in situations of sperm competition."

Incisor Crown Bending Strength Correlates with Diet and Incisor Curvature in Anthropoid Primates,"['Deane, AS']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.23042,FEB 2015,1,"Anthropoid incisors are large relative to the postcanine dentition and function in the preprocessing of food items. Previous analyses of anthropoid incisor allometry and shape demonstrate that incisor morphology is correlated with preferred foods and that more frugivorous anthropoids have larger and more curved incisors. Although the relationship between incisal crown curvature and preferred foods has been well documented in extant and fossil anthropoids, the functional significance of curvature variation has yet to be conclusively established. Given that an increase in crown curvature will increase maximum linear crown dimensions, and bending resistance is a function of linear crown dimensions, it is hypothesized that incisor crown curvature functons to increase incisor crown resistance to bending forces. This study uses beam theory to calculate the mesiodistal and labiolingual bending strengths of the maxillary and mandibular incisors of hominoid and platyrrhine taxa with differing diets and variable degrees of incisal curvature. Results indicate that bending strength correlates with incisal curvature and that frugivores have elevated incisor bending resistance relative to folivores. Maxillary central incisor bending strengths further discriminate platyrrhine and hominoid hard- and soft-object frugivores suggesting this crown is subjected to elevated occlusal loading relative to other incisors. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that incisor crown curvature functions to increase incisor crown resistance to bending forces but does not preclude the possibility that incisor bending strength is a composite function of multiple dentognathic variables including, but not limited to, incisor crown curvature.

Cortical Structure of Hallucal Metatarsals and Locomotor Adaptations in Hominoids,"['Jashashvili, T', 'Dowdeswell, MR', 'Lebrun, R', 'Carlson, KJ', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0117905,JAN 30 2015,1,"Diaphyseal morphology of long bones, in part, reflects in vivo loads experienced during the lifetime of an individual. The first metatarsal, as a cornerstone structure of the foot, presumably expresses diaphyseal morphology that reflects loading history of the foot during stance phase of gait. Human feet differ substantially from those of other apes in terms of loading histories when comparing the path of the center of pressure during stance phase, which reflects different weight transfer mechanisms. Here we use a novel approach for quantifying continuous thickness and cross-sectional geometric properties of long bones in order to test explicit hypotheses about loading histories and diaphyseal structure of adult chimpanzee, gorilla, and human first metatarsals. For each hallucal metatarsal, 17 cross sections were extracted at regularly-spaced intervals (2.5% length) between 25% and 65% length. Cortical thickness in cross sections was measured in one degree radially-arranged increments, while second moments of area were measured about neutral axes also in one degree radially-arranged increments. Standardized thicknesses and second moments of area were visualized using false color maps, while penalized discriminant analyses were used to evaluate quantitative species differences. Humans systematically exhibit the thinnest diaphyseal cortices, yet the greatest diaphyseal rigidities, particularly in dorsoplantar regions. Shifts in orientation of maximum second moments of area along the diaphysis also distinguish human hallucal metatarsals from those of chimpanzees and gorillas. Diaphyseal structure reflects different loading regimes, often in predictable ways, with human versus non-human differences probably resulting both from the use of arboreal substrates by non-human apes and by differing spatial relationships between hallux position and orientation of the substrate reaction resultant during stance. The novel morphological approach employed in this study offers the potential for transformative insights into form-function relationships in additional long bones, including those of extinct organisms (e.g., fossils)."
Identification of human-specific AluS elements through comparative genomics,"['Lee, J', 'Kim, YJ', 'Mun, S', 'Kim, HS', 'Han, K']",GENE,10.1016/j.gene.2014.11.005,JAN 25 2015,0,"Mobile elements are responsible for similar to 45% of the human genome. Among them is the Alu element, accounting for 10% of the human genome (>1.1 million copies). Several studies of Alu elements have reported that they are frequently involved in human genetic diseases and genomic rearrangements. In this study, we investigated the AluS subfamily, which is a relatively old Alu subfamily and has the highest copy number in primate genomes. Previously, a set of 263 human-specific AluS insertions was identified in the human genome. To validate these, we compared each of the human-specific AluS loci with its pre-insertion site in other primate genomes, including chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. We obtained 24 putative human-specific AluS candidates via the in silico analysis and manual inspection, and then tried to verify them using PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Through the PCR product sequencing, we were able to detect two instances of near-parallel Alu insertions in nearby sites that led to computational false negatives. Finally, we computationally and experimentally verified 23 human-specific AluS elements. We reported three alternative Abu insertion events, which are accompanied by filler DNA and/or Alu retrotransposition mediated-deletion. Bisulfite sequencing was carried out to examine DNA methylation levels of human-specific AluS elements. The results showed that fixed AluS elements are hypermethylated compared with polymorphic elements, indicating a possible relation between DNA methylation and Abu fixation in the human genome.

To examine whether gorillas harbor Leishmania species, we screened fecal samples from wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Cameroon for the presence of these pathogens. Of 91 wild gorilla fecal samples, 12 contained Leishmania parasites, and 4 contained phlebotomine sand fly vectors. The molecular identity was determined by running 3 different polymerase chain reaction tests for detection of L. major. Next, fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to visualize L. major parasites in fecal samples from the gorillas. Both promastigote and amastigote forms of the parasite were found. This work strongly suggests that wild gorillas carry pathogenic Leishmania parasites."
A preferential attachment model for primate social networks,"['Akbas, MI', 'Brust, MR', 'Turgut, D', 'Ribeiro, CHC']",COMPUTER NETWORKS,10.1016/j.comnet.2014.11.009,JAN 15 2015,0,"Wildlife monitoring is an enormous organizational challenge due to the required time and effort for setting and maintaining it. It is particularly difficult when the observed species has a complex social hierarchy and different roles for the members in the social group.

In this paper, we introduce an approach to model a primate social network. The primates have complex social behaviors and network structure. As a result, there is a need for realistic computational models to fully understand and analyze the social behavior of such animal groups. We propose a novel spatial cut-off preferential attachment model with a center of mass concept to model the characteristics of the primate groups and a role determination algorithm, which groups the primates into their roles in the society based on the data collected by the wireless sensor and actor networks (WSAN). The performance of the monitoring and role determination algorithms, the applicability of the network formation and the mobility models are evaluated through extensive simulations. The results show that the proposed primate group models deliver networks with properties similar to real-life primate groups in terms of social network characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The socio-matrix reloaded: from hierarchy to dominance profile in wild lemurs,"['Norscia, I', 'Palagi, E', 'PROPITHECUS-VERREAUXI']",PEERJ,10.7717/peerj.729,JAN 15 2015,2,"Dominance hierarchy influences the life quality of social animals, and its definition should in principle be based on the outcome of agonistic interactions. However, defining and comparing the dominance profile of social groups is difficult due to the different dominance measures used and because no one measure explains it all. We applied different analytical methods to winner-loser sociomatrices to determine the dominance profile of five groups of wild lemurs (species: Lemur catta, Propithecus verreauxi, and Eulemur rufus x collaris) from the Berenty forest (Madagascar). They are an excellent study model because they share the same habitat and an apparently similar dominance profile: linear hierarchy and female dominance. Data were collected over more than 1200 h of observation. Our approach included four steps: (1) by applying the binary dyadic dominance relationship method (I&SI) on either aggressions or supplant sociomatrices we verified whether hierarchy was aggression or submission based; (2) by calculating normalized David's scores and measuring steepness from aggression sociomatrices we evaluated whether hierarchy was shallow or steep; (3) by comparing the ranking orders obtained with methods 1 and 2 we assessed whether hierarchy was consistent or not; and (4) by assessing triangle transitivity and comparing it with the linearity index and the level of group cohesion we determined if hierarchy was more or less cohesive. Our results show that L. catta groups have got a steep, consistent, highly transitive and cohesive hierarchy. P. verreauxi groups are characterized by a moderately steep and consistent hierarchy, with variable levels of triangle transitivity and cohesion. E. rufus x collaris group possesses a shallow and inconsistent hierarchy, with lower (but not lowest) levels of transitivity and cohesion. A multiple analytical approach on winner-loser sociomatrices other than leading to an in-depth description of the dominance profile, allows intergroup and cross-species comparisons."

"Cooperation in primates A critical, methodological review","['Albiach-Serrano, A']",INTERACTION STUDIES,10.1075/is.16.3.02alb,2015,0,"Observational studies have suggested that some nonhuman primates' cooperative behavior may rely on their capacity to share goals and understand the role of their partners. Experimental studies have tried to find evidence for this under controlled conditions, investigating aspects like the degree of organization in different primate species and the individuals' capacity to recognize and choose good partners, switch roles with them, and care about their outcomes. Often, the results have been mixed. Partly, this is because of the methodological difficulties inherent to empirical research. In this paper, I offer a critical, methodological review of the experimental studies done in the last years on nonhuman primates' cooperation, I discuss their findings, and suggest possible solutions to some of the procedural problems. Hopefully, this will contribute to improve the design of future studies and therefore our knowledge about the evolutionary history of cooperation."

The place of Irvingia gabonensis in village communities around the Lobeke National Park in Cameroon,"['Caspa, RG', 'Tcnouamo, IR', 'Mweru, JPM', 'Amang, JM', 'Ngwa, MN']",BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES,NA,2015,0,"The bush mango, Irvingia gabonensis, is one of the most heavily used non-timber tree species around the Lobeke National Park in Cameroon. A survey among fruit gatherers showed that the fruits are collected from the forest floor, which involves very high risks of gorilla attack (100%) and long camping periods (87%). All the gatherers preserve this species, mostly (82%) by protecting wild seedlings, but they are generally reluctant to plant it. However, up to 68% of gatherers indicated that they would be willing to plant the species. The I. gabonensis kernel was ranked by gatherers (98%) as the second main source of food and the first main source of income (93%) among four major Non-Timber Forest Products in the area. An inventory was carried out to determine the abundance of the species in three forest systems: the protected area, a community production forest (a natural forest forming part of the non-permanent forest domain and managed by a village community with the assistance of the forestry administration) and agroforest (fallow land and productive crop/cocoa plantations), in 6 x 3 1-ha plots. Fruit production was assessed by counting fruits during gathering. Seedling growth and survival were assessed only in the protected area because very few seedlings were available in the production forest and agroforest. The overall mean density of I. gabonensis was assessed at 3.3 trees per ha, with no significant difference between the three forest systems. The mean diameter at breast height of I. gabonensis trees in all three forest systems was not significantly different. Mean fruit production in the three forest systems also showed no significant difference. Seedling survival fell to 70% in the protected area after 18 months. The presence of mostly medium to large diameter trees is an indication that the resource will continue to be available for some time but the near absence of younger individuals to replace the ageing population is detrimental to resource availability in the long term. Due to the intensity of gathering, it is recommended that the local population should actively incorporate this species into their farms."
Is the western lowland gorilla a good gardener? Evidence for directed dispersal in Southeast Gabon,"['Haurez, B', 'Brostaux, Y', 'Petre, CA', 'Doucet, JL']",BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES,NA,2015,0,"In Central African tropical forests, the western lowland gorilla deposits most of the seeds it disperses in well-lit nesting sites that can favour seedling growth. The faecal matrix surrounding the seeds can act as a fertiliser and further enhance seedling development. This fertilisation effect had never been tested. Our research therefore aimed to determine whether seed deposition by gorillas (i) in faecal matter and (ii) in nest sites is advantageous for seedling development (growth rate and foliation rate) and survival (% of surviving seedlings). To assess the effect of the faecal matrix, seeds of Santiria trimera (Burseraceae), Chrysophyllum lacourtianum (Sapotaceae) and Plagiostyles africana (Euphorbiaceae) collected from gorilla faeces were sown in a nursery with and without a faecal matrix. Seedlings of Santiria trimera and Dactyodes normandii (Burseraceae) were established in nest sites and in closed canopy terra firme forest sites to assess the impact of seed deposition on seedling development and survival. The faecal matrix was observed to positively influence seedling development in the species studied, but showed no effect on survival. Regarding seed deposition sites, the development rates observed were two to ten times higher in the nest sites than in closed-canopy forest. This enhanced seedling development was positively correlated with canopy openness. In situ studies of seed germination, seedling growth and survival are needed to characterise the fate of gorilla-dispersed seeds more precisely. However, our results offer evidence that gorillas provide important directed dispersal services by depositing seeds most frequently in open canopy sites."
"Fallback Foods, Optimal Diets, and Nutritional Targets: Primate Responses to Varying Food Availability and Quality","['Lambert, JE', 'Rothman, JM']","ANNUAL REVIEW OF ANTHROPOLOGY, VOL 44",10.1146/annurev-anthro-102313-025928,2015,1,"Eating is a risky affair. All animals have to offset risks of feeding such as exposure to plant toxins, increased vulnerability to predation, or conspecific aggression with a food's energetic and nutritional return. What, when, and where an individual eats can impact fitness and, ultimately, species-level adaptations. Here, we explore the variables that influence primate feeding preference: food availability, chemical defense, and nutrient content. We present information demonstrating that consumers manipulate nutrient and energy intake, indicating that what may be a less-than-optimal food for one state of an animal's phenotype may not be for another. This evidence suggests that factors previously assumed to be constraints in Optimal Foraging Theory, Functional Response, and-recently-Fallback Food feeding models would be better categorized as variables. We conclude that ""fallback"" is not an intrinsic state of the food or the consumer and that this conclusion complicates the application of this concept to morphological features in the fossil record."
Storytelling Animals: The Making of an Ecological Identity in Katherine Applegate’s The One and Only Ivan,"['Lee, Donghwan']",Literature and Environment,NA,2015,0,"<Abstract> Storytelling Animals: The Making of an Ecological Identity in Katherine Applegate’s The One and Only Ivan Dong-hwan Lee (Gyeongin National University of Education) This study examines the ecocritical implications of identity politics revealed in Katherine Applegate’s The One and Only Ivan. This novel does not limit its literary value to the exposition of theories of animal rights and their criticism to anthropomorphism. In the novel, a male gorilla named Ivan tells a story about the fellow animals around him. As the story develops, Ivan acquires synchronic and diachronic identities, indebted to the use of language and the recall of his troublesome memories. The acquisition of multiple identity changes him from a comfort-seeker in the cage to a responsible caretaker for a poor elephant named Ruby. In this way, Ivan not only escapes from the narrow boundary of speciesism, but also blurs the essential borderline between animals and human beings by describing himself to behave humanlike while presenting people in the storyline as brutal animals in the jungle. Ivan’s transition from self to Self contains meaningful ecocritical implications: the true ecological identity comes from mulling over his or her multiple identities both as an animal and as a reasoning creature.

It is a severe, often fatal disease in humans and nonhuman primates (gorillas and chimpanzees). This article discusses the history of Ebola disease, already known routes of infection together with defining prevention methods and treatment trials. The importance of increasing awareness of the risk of disease among people who do not inhabit endemic regions is emphasized. This risk is associated especially with the increasing popularity of tourism to African countries, even to those where the virus is endemic. The research conducted over the years shows that three species of frugivorous bats are subjected to contamination by Ebola, but the infection is asymptomatic in them. It is believed that the saliva of these mammals and other body fluids may be a potential source of infection for primates and humans. In the laboratory, infection through small-particle aerosols has been demonstrated in primates, and airborne spread among humans is strongly suspected, although it has not yet been conclusively demonstrated. The importance of this route of transmission remains unclear. Poor hygienic conditions can aid the spread of the virus. These observations suggest approaches to the study of routes of transmission to and among humans."

Searching for Feature-Based Surround Suppression in Inattentional Blindness.,"['Drew, Trafton']",Journal of vision,10.1167/15.12.443,2015,0,"When engaged in an attention-demanding task, Observers (Os) often miss stimuli that would otherwise be perfectly obvious, like a dancing gorilla or a clown on a unicycle, a finding known as Inattentional Blindness (IB). Previous work has shown noticing rates for unexpected stimuli increase as the similarity to the target increases: when tracking white items, Os are much more likely to notice an unexpected white stimulus than a black one. Most and colleagues (2001), showed that noticing rates follow a simple linear relation with the similarity of the attended stimulus, even for unexpected items of novel color (e.g. a grey item when tracking white items and ignoring black items). We wondered whether the presence of distractors in these intermediate positions would change the pattern of results. The presence of the distractors that share a similar color to the attended objects may result in this color being inhibited in feature space. Recent behavioral and electrophysiological work has suggested that feature-based suppression operates on colors that are similar (~30° in hue space) to the attended color (Stormer et al., 2014). For example, visual search performance for two colors separated by 30° in hue space was worse than performance for two colors separated by 75°. Os in the current study attended objects colored X while ignoring an equal number of distractors colored X+30° and X+180°. We measured IB rates for unexpected items of attended, near-attended and far from attended colors in different Os. Inconsistent with the predictions of surround suppression, IB rates were inversely proportional to similarity to the attended color. The results suggest that while we may use feature-based suppression to inhibit near-target colors under some circumstances, this does not manifest itself in reduced noticing rates during Inattentional Blindness.

Genetic evidence for contribution of human dispersal to the genetic diversity of EBA-175 in Plasmodium falciparum,"['Yasukochi, Y', 'Naka, I', 'Patarapotikul, J', 'Hananantachai, H', 'Ohashi, J']",MALARIA JOURNAL,10.1186/s12936-015-0820-2,AUG 1 2015,0,"Background: The 175-kDa erythrocyte binding antigen (EBA-175) of Plasmodium falciparum plays a crucial role in merozoite invasion into human erythrocytes. EBA-175 is believed to have been under diversifying selection; however, there have been no studies investigating the effect of dispersal of humans out of Africa on the genetic variation of EBA-175 in P. falciparum.

Methods: The PCR-direct sequencing was performed for a part of the eba-175 gene (regions II and III) using DNA samples obtained from Thai patients infected with P. falciparum. The divergence times for the P. falciparum eba-175 alleles were estimated assuming that P. falciparum/Plasmodium reichenowi divergence occurred 6 million years ago (MYA). To examine the possibility of diversifying selection, nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates for Plasmodium species were also estimated.

Results: A total of 32 eba-175 alleles were identified from 131 Thai P. falciparum isolates. Their estimated divergence time was 0.13-0.14 MYA, before the exodus of humans from Africa. A phylogenetic tree for a large sequence dataset of P. falciparum eba-175 alleles from across the world showed the presence of a basal Asian-specific cluster for all P. falciparum sequences. A markedly more nonsynonymous substitutions than synonymous substitutions in region II in P. falciparum was also detected, but not within Plasmodium species parasitizing African apes, suggesting that diversifying selection has acted specifically on P. falciparum eba-175.

Conclusions: Plasmodium falciparum eba-175 genetic diversity appeared to increase following the exodus of Asian ancestors from Africa. Diversifying selection may have played an important role in the diversification of eba-175 allelic lineages. The present results suggest that the dispersals of humans out of Africa influenced significantly the molecular evolution of P. falciparum EBA-175."
How Ebola impacts social dynamics in gorillas: a multistate modelling approach,"['Genton, C', 'Pierre, A', 'Cristescu, R', 'Levrero, F', 'Gatti, S', 'Pierre, JS', 'Menard, N', 'Le Gouar, P']",JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,10.1111/1365-2656.12268,JAN 2015,2,"Emerging infectious diseases can induce rapid changes in population dynamics and threaten population persistence. In socially structured populations, the transfers of individuals between social units, for example, from breeding groups to non-breeding groups, shape population dynamics. We suggest that diseases may affect these crucial transfers.

We aimed to determine how disturbance by an emerging disease affects demographic rates of gorillas, especially transfer rates within populations and immigration rates into populations.

We compared social dynamics and key demographic parameters in a gorilla population affected by Ebola using a long-term observation data set including pre-, during and post-outbreak periods. We also studied a population of undetermined epidemiological status in order to assess whether this population was affected by the disease. We developed a multistate model that can handle transition between social units while optimizing the number of states.

During the Ebola outbreak, social dynamics displayed increased transfers from a breeding to a non-breeding status for both males and females. Six years after the outbreak, demographic and most of social dynamics parameters had returned to their initial rates, suggesting a certain resilience in the response to disruption. The formation of breeding groups increased just after Ebola, indicating that environmental conditions were still attractive. However, population recovery was likely delayed because compensatory immigration was probably impeded by the potential impact of Ebola in the surrounding areas. The population of undetermined epidemiological status behaved similarly to the other population before Ebola.

Our results highlight the need to integrate social dynamics in host-population demographic models to better understand the role of social structure in the sensitivity and the response to disease disturbances."

Behavioral samples were generated, using infrared cameras for a total of 47 nights (136.25 h), in summer (n = 25) and winter (n = 22) periods. To characterize sleep behaviors, we used all-occurrence sampling to generate platform construction episodes (n = 217).

Comparisons between summer and winter platform construction showed winter start times (17:12 h) to be significantly earlier and longer in duration than summer start times (17:56 h).

The wild L. catta were also compared to a captive population to discern the effect of habitat within a species. Gut microbial DNA was extracted from fecal samples collected in Madagascar and the Vienna Zoo and sequenced. The wild and captive L. catta had distinct microbial communities, likely due to differences in diet and development between their populations. The wild L. catta and P. verreauxi also had distinct gut microbiomes, due to a change in microbial abundance, not composition. Within each lemur species, there was abundant variation between individuals and from the dry to the wet season. The intraspecific and temporal microbial variation requires more investigation, with changes in diet a likely contributor. (C) 2015 5. Karger AG, Basel"
Relation between the level of self-mutilation and the concentration of fecal metabolites of glucocorticoids in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Pizzutto, CS', 'Sgai, MGFG', 'Lopes, DA', 'Pessutti, C', 'Nunes, A', 'Furtado, PV', 'de Oliveira, CA', 'Guimaraes, MABV']",PESQUISA VETERINARIA BRASILEIRA,NA,JAN 2015,0,"The influence of stress in an environment, according with the behavioral and endocrine variables of primates, are increasingly being studied by a diversity of authors, and have shown that abnormal behaviors associated with increased glucocorticoids may be directly related with the impairment of their well-being. In this work were used 22 adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), 11 males and 11 females, kept in captivity in three different institutions. All animals had their behavior registered by focal session using a 30 seconds sample interval, during six months, totaling 4,800 registries per each animal. During this period, fecal samples were collected 3 times a week for the extraction and measurement of the concentration of fecal metabolites of glucocorticoid by radioimmunoassay. Of the total observed, stereotypical behaviors represented 13,45 +/- 2.76%, and among them, self-mutilation represented 38.28 +/- 3.98 %. The animals were classified into three different scores, according with the percentage of body surface with alopecia due to self-mutilation. It was found a positive correlation of high intensity between the scores of alopecia due to the observed mutilation and the average concentrations of fecal metabolites of glucocorticoids. This result strongly suggests that this measurement of self-mutilation in a chimpanzee can be used as an important auxiliary tool to evaluate de conditions of adaptation of an animal in captivity, functioning as a direct indicator of the presence of chronic stress."

Here, we examined whether HIV-1-specific bNabs are capable of cross-neutralizing distantly related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting central (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) (SIVcpzPtt) and eastern (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) (SIVcpzPts) chimpanzees (n = 11) as well as western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) (SIVgor) (n = 1). We found that bNabs directed against the CD4 binding site (n = 10), peptidoglycans at the base of variable loop 3 (V3) (n = 5), and epitopes at the interface of surface (gp120) and membrane-bound (gp41) envelope glycoproteins (n = 5) failed to neutralize SIVcpz and SIVgor strains. In addition, apex V2-directed bNabs (n = 3) as well as llama-derived (heavy chain only) antibodies (n = 6) recognizing both the CD4 binding site and gp41 epitopes were either completely inactive or neutralized only a fraction of SIVcpzPtt strains. In contrast, one antibody targeting the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of gp41 (10E8), functional CD4 and CCR5 receptor mimetics (eCD4-Ig, eCD4-Ig(mim2), CD4-218.3-E51, and CD4-218.3-E51-mim2), as well as mono- and bispecific anti-human CD4 (iMab and LM52) and CCR5 (PRO140, PRO140-10E8) receptor antibodies neutralized >90% of SIVcpz and SIVgor strains with low-nanomolar (0.13 to 8.4 nM) potency. Importantly, the latter antibodies blocked virus entry not only in TZM-bl cells but also in Cf2Th cells expressing chimpanzee CD4 and CCR5 and neutralized SIVcpz in chimpanzee CD4(+) T cells, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) ranging from 3.6 to 40.5 nM. These findings provide new insight into the protective capacity of anti-HIV-1 bNabs and identify candidates for further development to combat SIVcpz infection.

IMPORTANCE: SIVcpz is widespread in wild-living chimpanzees and can cause AIDS-like immunopathology and clinical disease. HIV-1 infection of humans can be controlled by antiretroviral therapy; however, treatment of wild-living African apes with current drug regimens is not feasible. Nonetheless, it may be possible to curb the spread of SIVcpz in select ape communities using vectored immunoprophylaxis and/or therapy. Here, we show that antibodies and antibody-like inhibitors developed to combat HIV-1 infection in humans are capable of neutralizing genetically diverse SIVcpz and SIVgor strains with considerable breadth and potency, including in primary chimpanzee CD4(+) T cells. These reagents provide an important first step toward translating intervention strategies currently developed to treat and prevent AIDS in humans to SIV-infected apes.

We review recent research on the origins of human decision making by examining whether similar choice biases are seen in nonhuman primates, our closest phylogenetic relatives. We propose that comparative studies can provide insight into four major questions about the nature of human choice biases that cannot be addressed by studies of our species alone. First, research with other primates can address the evolution of human choice biases and identify shared versus human-unique tendencies in decision making. Second, primate studies can constrain hypotheses about the psychological mechanisms underlying such biases. Third, comparisons of closely related species can identify when distinct mechanisms underlie related biases by examining evolutionary dissociations in choice strategies.

To investigate the sequence and expression information, as well as its role in modulating lipid metabolism, we cloned SP1 gene from mammary gland of Xinong Saanen dairy goat. The full-length cDNA of the SP1 gene is 4376 bp including 103 bp of 5'UTR, 2358 bp of ORF (HM_236311) and 1915 bp of 3'UTR, which is predicted to encode a 786 amino acids polypeptide. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that goat SP1 has the closest relationship with sheep, followed by bovines (bos taurus, odobenus and ceratotherium), pig, primates (pongo, gorilla, macaca and papio) and murine (rattus and mus), while the furthest relationship was with canis and otolemur. Expression was predominant in the lungs, small intestine, muscle, spleen, mammary gland and subcutaneous fat. There were no significant expression level differences between the mammary gland tissues collected at lactation and dry-off period. Overexpression of SP1 in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) led to higher mRNA expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma) and lower liver X receptor alpha (LXR alpha) mRNA level, both of which were crucial in regulating fatty acid metabolism, and correspondingly altered the expression of their downstream genes in GMECs. These results were further enhanced by the silencing of SP1. These findings suggest that SP1 may play an important role in fatty acid metabolism."
"Middle Pliocene hominin mandibular fourth premolars from Woranso-Mille (Central Afar, Ethiopia)","['Haile-Selassie, Y', 'Melillo, SM', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.08.005,JAN 2015,2,"The Woranso-Mille study area has thus far yielded more than 120 early hominin fossil specimens dated to between 3.4 and 3.8 million years ago. Previous studies indicate that dentognathic fossil remains from the study area show a mosaic of features shared by both Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis. Here, we describe 12 isolated mandibular fourth premolars recovered from the Woranso-Mille study area and compare them with those of other early hominins using both traditional comparative methods and geometric morphometric methods. The results indicate that the Woranso-Mille sample is most similar to Au. afarensis among hominins. However, some specimens show distinctive features of crown shape, namely an extremely bulging distolingual corner associated with a relatively large talonid and a mesiodistally elongated crown. This unique morphology is accompanied by a root form that is different from those identified previously. The existence of distinctive 134 morphology is intriguing given the presence of more than one hominin species at Woranso-Mille, although support for taxonomic heterogeneity in this sample is equivocal. Further, the taxonomic significance of these features is unclear, as they fail to distinguish Pan from Gorilla and known hominin species from one another. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Sharing fruit of Treculia africana among western gorillas in the Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon: Preliminary report","['Yamagiwa, J', 'Tsubokawa, K', 'Inoue, E', 'Ando, C']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-014-0433-3,JAN 2015,0,"We report the first 18 observed cases of fruit (Treculia africana) transfer among western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon. The fruit transfer occurred during our observations of a habituated group of gorillas in 2010 and 2013. Pieces of the fruits were transferred among adults and immatures, and three cases involved a silverback male. Once an individual picked up a fallen fruit of Treculia africana, other members of the group approached the possessor, who laid pieces of the fruits nearby and tolerated the others getting them. Agonistic interaction was rarely observed between the possessor and the non-possessor. Only the silverback male seemed to force another gorilla, a subadult male, to relinquish the fruit on the ground. He tolerated an adult female taking a piece of fruit on his leg and copulated with her on the following days. From these preliminary observations, most interactions over the fruit of Treculia africana among western gorillas in Moukalaba were not active transfer by the possessor but probably passive sharing. They were not only interpreted as a means of acquiring foraging skills by immatures (Nowell and Fletcher 2006) but also similar to behaviors observed in chimpanzees and bonobos in various social contexts."
Use of photogrammetry as a means to assess hybrids of rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and long-tailed (M-fascicularis) macaques,"['Jadejaroen, J', 'Hamada, Y', 'Kawamoto, Y', 'Malaivijitnond, S']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-014-0450-2,JAN 2015,2,"Rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and long-tailed (M. fascicularis) macaques are the most commonly used non-human primate models for biomedical research, but it is difficult to identify these two species in the hybrid zone (15-20A degrees N). In this work, we used morphological values obtained via photogrammetry to assess hybrids of rhesus and long-tailed macaques at Khao Khieow Open Zoo (KKZ; 13A degrees 21'N, 101A degrees 06'E), eastern Thailand. Long-tailed and rhesus macaques have species-specific tail lengths and contrasts of their yellowish pelages. The accuracy and precision of the relative tail length (%RTL) and the contrast of the yellow hue (Cb*) of the pelage, as obtained from photographs, were compared with the corresponding direct measurements (morphometrics). The photogrammetric and morphometric measurements of %RTL and Cb* were highly significantly correlated (r = 0.989 and 0.980, p < 0.001), and there were no significant differences between the two datasets (t test, p = 0.13 and 0.41; n = 42 and 17 for %RTL and Cb*, respectively). The reproducibilities of the %RTL and Cb* measurements (calculated in the photogrammetric case by taking photographs of the same macaques in two different environments) were significantly correlated between the datasets (r = 0.983 and 0.914, p < 0.001 and 0.005), and there were no significant differences between the datasets (t test, p = 0.539 and 0.344; n = 30 each for %RTL and Cb*, respectively). The %RTL and Cb* data were combined with data on the crown and cheek hair patterns and sex skin reddening of the macaques, and this combined data set was then analyzed by multiple correspondence analysis and agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis, leading to the categorization of the rhesus macaques, long-tailed macaques, and hybrids at KKZ into five groups. Thus, photogrammetry can be utilized to identify macaque species or hybrids when species identification relies mainly on tail length and pelage color."
Are we Ignoring Neutral and Negative Human-Animal Relationships in Zoos?,"['Hosey, G', 'Melfi, V']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21182,JAN-FEB 2015,0,"Human-animal interactions (HAI), which may lead to human-animal relationships (HAR), may be positive, neutral, or negative in nature. Zoo studies show that visitors may be stressful, may have no effect, or may be enriching. There is also evidence that good HARs set up between animals and their keepers can have positive effects on animal welfare. However, we need to know more about negative HARs, and as a first step we attempt to do this here by considering cases where animals attack people in the zoo. Due to the sensitivity and rarity of these events data appear sparse and unsystematically collected. Here, information available in the public domain about the circumstances of these attacks has been collated to test hypotheses about negative HAIs derived from a model of zoo HARs. The limited data presented here broadly support the zoo HAR model, and suggest that attacks usually happen in unusual circumstances, where there may be a failure by the animal to recognise the HAR, or where the relationship, if there is one, does not hold; and give some support to the prediction that exposure to many keepers may impair the development of a positive HAR. This study may provide useful information for the zoo community to proactively collect systematic standardised records, which will enable a fuller understanding of zoo HARs, upon which appropriate measures might be adopted to build better zoo HARs, which are likely to positively impact zoo animal welfare, and reduce these rare incidences further.

Geometry of nutrition in field studies: an illustration using wild primates,"['Raubenheimer, D', 'Machovsky-Capuska, GE', 'Chapman, CA', 'Rothman, JM']",OECOLOGIA,10.1007/s00442-014-3142-0,JAN 2015,2,"Nutritional geometry has shown the benefits of viewing nutrition in a multidimensional context, in which foraging is viewed as a process of balancing the intake and use of multiple nutrients. New insights into nutrient regulation have been generated in studies performed in a laboratory context, where accurate measures of amounts (e.g. eaten, converted to body mass, excreted) can be made and analysed using amounts-based nutritional geometry. In most field situations, however, proportional compositions (e.g. of foods, diets, faeces) are the only measures readily available, and in some cases are more relevant to the problem at hand. For this reason, a complementary geometric method was recently introduced for analysing multi-dimensional data on proportional compositions in nutritional studies, called the right-angled mixture triangle (RMT). We use literature data from field studies of primates to demonstrate how the RMT can provide insight into a variety of important concepts in nutritional ecology. We first compare the compositions of foods, using as an example primate milks collected in both the wild and the laboratory. We next compare the diets of different species of primates from the same habitat and of the same species (mountain gorillas) from two distinct forests. Subsequently, we model the relationships between the composition of gorilla diets in these two habitats and the foods that comprise these diets, showing how such analyses can provide evidence for active nutrient-specific regulation in a field context. We provide a framework to relate concepts developed in laboratory studies with field-based studies of nutrition."

Results based on exon sequences confirm previously published, but considering only the sequences of the introns, two distinct regions can be differentiated. The first one comprises from the 5' untranslated region region to the first part of intron 3 sequence (shared with A2 family), and the second one includes the sequence from the end of intron 3 to intron 7 (shared with A1/A3/A11/A36/A30 family). Each of them clusters with Gorilla and Chimpanzee MHC-A sequences, respectively, suggesting an origin coming from a common ancestor to Gorilla and Chimpanzee."
How (not) to perform ecosystem service valuations: pricing gorillas in the mist,"['Fanny, B', 'Nicolas, D', 'Sander, J', 'Erik, GB', 'Marc, D']",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,10.1007/s10531-014-0796-1,JAN 2015,2,"Monetary valuation of ecosystem services (ES) is gaining growing interest in scientific papers, policies and awareness-raising documents for its potential as a communication tool illustrating the societal importance of biodiversity. However, simultaneously, its limitations are increasingly discussed in the literature. In this paper we argue that monetary valuation of ES should be seen as representing only one component of ES valuations. We provide basic standards to ensure integrated approaches to ES valuation that can effectively contribute to preserving cultural and biological diversity by acknowledging boundaries to resource exploitation and by building on the various interests and socio-cultural values of involved stakeholders. We base our discussion on a recent study that assesses the economic value of the world-famous Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, home to some of the last mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei). We alert against some ES monetary valuation that narrowly frames biodiversity conservation in terms of economic calculus and argue that subjugating conservation efforts to profit logics downplays the importance of intrinsic, symbolic and other non-economic values of biodiversity. We conclude by providing principles and methodological guidelines to enhance ES valuation as a tool to promote awareness rising for biodiversity conservation through the understanding the overall importance of biodiversity for human societies."
"Analysis of the AHR gene proximal promoter GGGGC-repeat polymorphism in lung, breast, and colon cancer","['Spink, BC', 'Bloom, MS', 'Wu, SS', 'Sell, S', 'Schneider, E', 'Ding, XX', 'Spink, DC']",TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY,10.1016/j.taap.2014.10.017,JAN 1 2015,0,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) regulates expression of numerous genes, including those of the CYP1 gene family. With the goal of determining factors that control AHR gene expression, our studies are focused on the role of the short tandem repeat polymorphism, (GGGGC)(n), located in the proximal promoter of the human AHR gene. When luciferase constructs containing varying GGGGC repeats were transfected into cancer cell lines derived from the lung, colon, and breast, the number of GGGGC repeats affected AHR promoter activity. The number of GGGGC repeats was determined in DNA from 327 humans and from 38 samples representing 5 species of non-human primates. In chimpanzees and 3 species of macaques, only (GGGGC)(2) alleles were observed; however, in western gorilla, (GGGGC)(n) alleles with n = 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were identified. In all human populations examined, the frequency of (GGGGC)(n) was n = 4 > 5 >> 2, 6. When frequencies of the (GGGGC)(n) alleles in DNA from patients with lung, colon, or breast cancer were evaluated, the occurrence of (GGGGC)(2) was found to be 8-fold more frequent among lung cancer patients in comparison with its incidence in the general population, as represented by New York State neonates. Analysis of matched tumor and non-tumor DNA samples from the same individuals provided no evidence of microsatellite instability. These studies indicate that the (GGGGC)n short tandem repeats are inherited, and that the (GGGGC)2 allele in the AHR proximal promoter region should be further investigated with regard to its potential association with lung cancer susceptibility.

Three-Dimensional Geometric Morphometric Analysis of the Nasopharyngeal Boundaries and Its Functional Integration with the Face and External Basicranium Among Extant Hominoids,"['Pagano, AS', 'Laitman, JT']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.23076,JAN 2015,1,"The nasopharynx is a centrally located but understudied upper respiratory tract component. This study tested hypotheses related to the functional integration of the nasopharyngeal boundaries with the facial skeleton and external basicranium over the course of development in humans and nonhuman hominoids. It was hypothesized that facial morphology (width, length, and kyphosis) is related to nasopharyngeal width and choanal morphology, whereas relative external basicranial proportions are related to nasopharyngeal depth. Human infants were used as models of extreme orthognathy and external basicranial retroflexion, whereas nonhuman hominoids were used to model greater relative prognathism and external basicranial retroflexion. Both of these groups were contrasted against adult humans, who exhibit both extreme orthognathy and external basicranial flexion. Three-dimensional landmark coordinate data were collected from age-graded series of Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, and Hylobates. Generalized Procrustes Analysis was performed, and multivariate shape differences were evaluated via principal components analysis. Additionally, linear measures were extracted from the Procrustes-corrected sets of landmark data. Results indicate that human adults are indeed distinct from all groups in possessing a relatively shallow nasopharyngeal roof and shorter, more flexed external basicranial axis. Human adults and infants both exhibit greater relative choanal and nasopharyngeal width. Nonhuman hominoid faces tended to become airorhynch into adulthood, whereas humans exhibited the opposite trend. When pooling all the hominoids, facial width and palate length were strongly correlated with choanal and nasopharyngeal width, whereas facial kyphosis was strongly correlated with choanal orientation. The hypotheses were supported as the results indicated a morphologic relationship among nasopharyngeal boundaries, the facial skeleton, and the external basicranium. Anat Rec, 298:85-106, 2015.

Geometric Morphometrics of Hominoid Infraspinous Fossa Shape,"['Green, DJ', 'Serrins, JD', 'Seitelman, B', 'Martiny, AR', 'Gunz, P', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.23071,JAN 2015,2,"Recent discoveries of early hominin scapulae from Ethiopia (Dikika, Woranso-Mille) and South Africa (Malapa) have motivated new examinations of the relationship between scapular morphology and locomotor function. In particular, infraspinous fossa shape has been shown to significantly differ among hominoids. However, this region presents relatively few homologous landmarks, such that traditional distance and angle-based methods may oversimplify this three-dimensional structure. To more thoroughly assess infraspinous fossa shape variation as it relates to function among adult hominoid representatives, we considered two geometric morphometric (GM) approachesone employing five homologous landmarks (wireframe) and another with 83 sliding semilandmarks along the border of the infraspinous fossa. We identified several differences in infraspinous fossa shape with traditional approaches, particularly in superoinferior fossa breadth and scapular spine orientation. The wireframe analysis reliably captured the range of shape variation in the sample, which reflects the relatively straightforward geometry of the infraspinous fossa. Building on the traditional approach, the GM results highlighted how the orientation of the medial portion of the infraspinous fossa differed relative to both the axillary border and spine. These features distinguished Pan from Gorilla in a way that traditional analyses had not been able to discern. Relative to the wireframe method, the semilandmark approach further distinguished Pongo from Homo, highlighting aspects of infraspinous fossa morphology that may be associated with climbing behaviors in hominoid taxa. These results highlight the ways that GM methods can enhance our ability to evaluate complex aspects of shape for refining and testing hypotheses about functional morphology.

Three-Dimensional Geometric Morphometric Analysis of Talar Morphology in Extant Gorilla Taxa from Highland and Lowland Habitats,"['Knigge, RP', 'Tocheri, MW', 'Orr, CM', 'Mcnulty, KP', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.23069,JAN 2015,2,"Western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) are known to climb significantly more often than eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei), a behavioral distinction attributable to major differences in their respective habitats (i.e., highland vs. lowland). Genetic evidence suggests that the lineages leading to these taxa began diverging from one another between approximately 1 and 3 million years ago. Thus, gorillas offer a special opportunity to examine the degree to which morphology of recently diverged taxa may be fine-tuned to differing ecological requirements. Using three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics, we compared talar morphology in a sample of 87 specimens including western (lowland), mountain (highland), and grauer gorillas (lowland and highland populations). Talar shape was captured with a series of landmarks and semilandmarks superimposed by generalized Procrustes analysis. A between-group principal components analysis of overall talar shape separates gorillas by ecological habitat and by taxon. An analysis of only the trochlea and lateral malleolar facet identifies subtle variations in trochlear shape between western lowland and lowland grauer gorillas, potentially indicative of convergent evolution of arboreal adaptations in the talus. Lastly, talar shape scales differently with centroid size for highland and lowland gorillas, suggesting that ankle morphology may track body-size mediated variation in arboreal behaviors differently depending on ecological setting. Several of the observed shape differences are linked biomechanically to the facilitation of climbing in lowland gorillas and to stability and load-bearing on terrestrial substrates in the highland taxa, providing an important comparative model for studying morphological variation in groups known only from fossils (e.g., early hominins).

Emotionality and intentionality in bonobo playful communication,"['Demuru, E', 'Ferrari, PF', 'Palagi, E']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-014-0804-6,JAN 2015,1,"Great apes show very complex systems for communicating emotions and intentions. Whereas gestures are intentional signals, facial expressions can disclose both emotions and intentions. The playful context is a good field to explore the possible dichotomy between intentionally and emotionally driven signals as it has been suggested that one of its functions is to learn producing and decoding communicative patterns. To understand how signals are produced during play and how they are modified in the course of ontogeny, we investigated the use of playful facial expressions and gestures in bonobos (Pan paniscus), a tolerant species showing a high propensity to play even as adults. Our results showed that the use of play faces and gestures is strongly influenced by the characteristics of the play session. Both play faces and gestures were more often performed when social play involved physical contact and when the receiver was visually attending, thus suggesting that both signals can be strategically employed when communicating becomes more urgent. Compared to play faces, gestures were more frequent during dyadic than polyadic sessions, when a unique receiver was involved. Being gestures not context specific, they are probably used more selectively by the sender. On the contrary, play faces are context specific and transmit an unequivocal positive message that cannot be misconceived. These features legitimize a broad use of playful facial expressions, independently of the number of playmates. The similarities and differences in the production of these signals are probably linked to the different degree of emotionality and intentionality characterizing them."

It implies a number of features in the entire body associated with the use of the forelimb in overhead positions. The glenohumeral joint is one of the main joints involved in effective suspensory locomotion, being subject to a delicate balance between the high degree of mobility and stabilization needed to successfully engage in suspensory behaviors. Here, we present a 3D geometric morphometric study that explores the form of the proximal humerus of six orthograde and semi-orthograde genera (Hylobates, Pongo, Pan, Gorilla, Ateles, and Lagothrix) and a pronograde genus, Colobus, to determine to what extent suspensory locomotor requirements are driving the shape of this epiphysis. Results show the presence of a morphocline related to degree of suspension in the shape of the articular surface, with highly suspensory taxa (i.e., Hylobates) exhibiting particular morphological traits at the articular surface that provide a greater range of circumduction. The placement and orientation of the rotator cuff muscles' insertion sites on the tubercles appear associated with the divergent forces operating at the joint in quadrupedal or above-head use of the hand.

Core Promoter Short Tandem Repeats as Evolutionary Switch Codes for Primate Speciation,"['Ohadi, M', 'Valipour, E', 'Ghadimi-Haddadan, S', 'Namdar-Aligoodarzi, P', 'Bagheri, A', 'Kowsari, A', 'Rezazadeh, M', 'Darvish, H', 'Kazeminasab, S']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22308,JAN 2015,3,"Alteration in gene expression levels underlies many of the phenotypic differences across species. Because of their highly mutable nature, proximity to the +1 transcription start site (TSS), and the emerging evidence of functional impact on gene expression, core promoter short tandem repeats (STRs) may be considered an ideal source of variation across species. In a genome-scale analysis of the entire Homo sapiens protein-coding genes, we have previously identified core promoters with at least one STR of 6-repeats, with possible selective advantage in this species. In the current study, we performed reverse analysis of the entire Homo sapiens orthologous genes in mouse in the Ensembl database, in order to identify conserved STRs that have shrunk as an evolutionary advantage to humans. Two protocols were used to minimize ascertainment bias. Firstly, two species sharing a more recent ancestor with Homo sapiens (i.e. Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla) were also included in the study. Secondly, four non-primate species encompassing the major orders across Mammals, including Scandentia, Laurasiatheria, Afrotheria, and Xenarthra were analyzed as out-groups. We introduce STR evolutionary events specifically identical in primates (i.e. Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Gorilla gorilla gorilla) vs. non-primate out-groups. The average frequency of the identically shared STR motifs across those primates ranged between 0.00005 and 0.06. The identified genes are involved in important evolutionary and developmental processes, such as normal craniofacial development (TFAP2B), regulation of cell shape (PALMD), learning and long-term memory (RGS14), nervous system development (GFRA2), embryonic limb morphogenesis (PBX2), and forebrain development (APAF1). We provide evidence of core promoter STRs as evolutionary switch codes for primate speciation, and the first instance of identity-by-descent for those motifs at the interspecies level. Am. J.

Ficus (seven species) was the most common seed genus identified, occurring in 61.2% of all fecal samples. Based on fecal analysis and phenological data, Ngel Nyaki chimpanzees do not solely consume fruits based on their availability within the habitat; while the proportion of fruit consumed did reflect the relative availability of fruit in the forest for some fruit species, Ficus was a preferred fruit even when scarce. In contrast, the proportion consumed of other fruit species was low relative to the abundance of their fruit available in the forest. Our results from the Rank Preference Index (RPI) suggest that relative preferences in fruit are seasonal. We discuss the role of Ficus in the diet of chimpanzees in Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve. Am. J.

Adaptive evolution at immune system genes and deep pregnancy implantation in primates,"['Civetta, A']",GENOMICS,10.1016/j.ygeno.2014.11.003,JAN 2015,1,"A major evolutionary change in the lineage ancestral to humans, chimpanzee and gorilla (HCG) has been the embedding of the embryo into maternal tissue. Thus, the first layer of cells (trophoblast) to differentiate after fertilization must adapt to invade the uterus. Such event would likely leave signatures of positive selection at genes with roles in embryo implantation. Here, 163 pregnancy implantation genes are tested for evidence of adaptive diversification in the ancestral lineage to HCG. Two immune system genes, HLA-E and KIR2DL4 showed evidence of positive selection. Some of the positive selected sites involve amino acid substitution with predicted damaging effects on protein function, thus highlighting the possibility of antagonistic pleiotropic effects. Selection at a gene coding for a receptor expressed in uterine cells (KIR) that interacts with trophoblast human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes suggests a main role for immunological adaptations in embryo deep invasion of the maternal endometrium.

Phenetic and Functional Analyses of the Distal Ulna of Australopithecus afarensis and Australopithecus africanus,"['Tallman, M']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.23078,JAN 2015,0,"The morphology of the distal portion of the hominoid ulna is poorly studied despite its important functional role at the wrist joint. There are five qualitatively well-described fossil hominin distal ulnae belonging to Australopithecus afarensis and Australopithecus africanus, but there have been few efforts to quantify their morphology or relate it to their functional abilities. This article presents an effort to do so, using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to analyze the shape of the distal ulna of the Plio-Pleistocene hominins and an extant comparative sample of great apes and humans. For the extant taxa, results show that the morphology of Pan and Pongo is distinct from that of Homo, and that these differences are likely related to climbing, clambering and below-branch suspension in the former, and the release of the limbs from locomotion and (potentially) tool manufacture in the latter. For the australopiths, results indicate that the A. afarensis sample is relatively heterogeneous. These results are driven by the morphology of A.L. 333-12, which is the largest ulna in the sample and has a unique combination of traits when compared with the other two A. afarensis specimens. Overall, the morphology of all the hominins was most consistent with the pattern displayed by extant great apes, and specifically Pan and Pongo; however, large overlap in shape in the distal ulna in the extant sample indicates that other areas of the skeleton may be more informative for functional analyses.

Results General surgeons underestimated the time required for the procedure by 31 minutes (95% confidence interval 7.6 to 54.4), meaning that procedures took, on average, 28.7% longer than predicted. Plastic surgeons underestimated by 5 minutes (-12.4 to 22.4), with procedures taking an average of 4.5% longer than predicted. Orthopaedic surgeons overestimated by 1 minute (-16.4 to 14.0), with procedures taking an average of 1.1% less time than predicted. Anaesthetists underestimated by 35 minutes (21.7 to 48.7), meaning that, on average, procedures took 167.5% longer than they predicted. The four specialty mean time overestimations or underestimations are significantly different from each other (P=0.01). The observed time differences between anaesthetists and both orthopaedic and plastic surgeons are significantly different (P< 0.05), but the time difference between anaesthetists and general surgeons is not significantly different.

Conclusion The inability of clinicians to predict the necessary time for a procedure is a significant cause of delay in the operating theatre. This study suggests that anaesthetists are the most inaccurate and highlights the potential differences between specialties in what is considered part of the ""anaesthesia time."""
The human acromion viewed from an evolutionary perspective,"['Voisin, JL', 'Ropars, M', 'Thomazeau, H']",ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH,10.1016/j.otsr.2014.09.011,DEC 2014,1,"The high prevalence of rotator cuff tendinopathy in modern humans may be partly related to the shape acquired by the scapula as species changed throughout evolution. Here, we compared the anatomic features of the scapula across members of the Hominoid group. The results support the hypothesis that the scapula of Homo sapiens sapiens exhibits distinctive anatomic characteristics compared to that of other Hominoids. We studied 89 scapulae from five species. For each scapula, we measured eight parameters and determined six index. We then compared the results across species. We identified two distinctive characteristics of the lateral aspect of the human scapula, namely, a lateral orientation of the glenoid cavity and a narrow coraco-acromial arch. Similar to the gorilla acromion, the human one is steeply sloped and, above all, larger and squarer than the acromion of other Hominoids. These features may explain, in part at least, the pathogenesis of rotator cuff tendinopathy in modern man. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."

Three strains, KZ01(T), KZ02 and KZ03, were isolated at the Kyoto City Zoo, Japan, and one strain, GG02, was isolated in the Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon. These strains were investigated taxonomically. These strains belonged to the Lactobacillus reuteri phylogenetic group according to phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and specific phenotypic characteristics. Phylogenetic analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strains KZ01(T), KZ02, KZ03 and GG02 formed a single monophyletic cluster and had a distinct line of descent. Based on sequence similarity of the 16S rRNA gene, Lactobacillus fermentum JCM 1173(T) (96.6%) was the closest neighbour to these novel strains, although it was clear that these strains belonged to a different species. Partial pheS sequences also supported these relationships. DNA DNA relatedness between strain KZ01(T) and L. fermentum JCM 1173(T) was less than 22% and the DNA G+C content of strain KZ01(T) was 50.7 mol%. The cell-wall peptidoglycan type was AO (L-Orn D-Asp) and the major fatty acids were C-16:0, C-18:1 omega 9c and C-19:1 cyclo 9,10. Therefore, based on phylogenetic, phenotypic and physiological evidence, these strains represent a novel species of the genus Lactobacillus, for which the name Lactobacillus gorillae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KZ01(T) (=JCM 19575(T)=DSM 28356(T))."

"Geophagy of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) at Xiangguqing in the Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve, China","['Li, DY', 'Ren, BP', 'Hu, J', 'Zhang, QY', 'Yang, YM', 'Grueter, CC', 'Krzton, A', 'He, XM', 'Li, M']",NORTH-WESTERN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,NA,DEC 2014,0,"Geophagy is common in extant nonhuman primate species, but the exact reasons for it across species remain unclear. Previous diet studies on Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) were only focused on organic materials (plants and small animals). There are no reports on R. bieti exhibiting geophagy in the field before this study. This study was carried out at Xiangguqing in the Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve from June 2008 to May 2009. We recorded the behavior of geophagy and collected samples of soil consumed by the monkeys there and analyzed their content in a laboratory. We identified a total of eight sites where the monkeys consumed soil in the home range during the study period. The total time spent ingesting soil was 13,690 seconds. 20 adult males, 34 adult females except lactating mothers, and 12 immatures without infants were seen to eat soil throughout this study. Average time spent in soil-eating bouts differed significantly among age/sex classes. This study suggests that particular age/sex classes or individuals in certain states of society and health will predictably display a behavioral pattern of geophagy. Our data indicate that geophagy in R. bicti is best explained as a response to nutrient deficiency, as soil consumed by the monkeys was significantly higher in calcium, copper, zinc, iron, manganese, and sodium. Although R. bicti consumes iron-rich soil, control samples that were not consumed also had high levels of iron, suggesting that high altitude alone is not a sufficient explanation for geophagy in this species."
Challenges in the use of genetic mark-recapture to estimate the population size of Bwindi mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei),"['Roy, J', 'Vigilant, L', 'Gray, M', 'Wright, E', 'Kato, R', 'Kabano, P', 'Basabose, A', 'Tibenda, E', 'Kuhl, HS', 'Robbins, MM']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2014.10.011,DEC 2014,4,"Monitoring the population dynamics of endangered species is a critical component of conservation management strategies, but attaining accurate and precise estimates of population sizes using cost and time effective methods can be challenging. Routine censuses of the two populations of critically endangered mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei have been conducted over the last decades to monitor populations and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation strategies. A census in 2006 of the mountain gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, showed the value of genetic analysis of fecal samples collected at nest sites by revealing discrepancies between the numbers of nests and uniquely identified gorillas. In this study, we censused the Bwindi gorilla population using a 'mark-recapture' method which involved genetic analysis of fecal samples collected in 2011 during two 'sweep' surveys of the entire park. We found that a notable proportion of gorillas were missed in either of the two sweeps (minimum 35% and 31%, respectively). Based on the number of genotyped gorillas and correction factors, we estimated the population to contain a minimum of 400 individuals. Using the mark-recapture approach, we infer possibly as many as 430 gorillas (95% confidence interval: 398-487). As the 2010 census of the Virunga Massif population found 480 gorillas, the total number of mountain gorillas worldwide is at least 880 individuals. Simulations using different mark-recapture models suggest that a future census of Bwindi mountain gorillas would benefit by increasing the number of sweeps in order to achieve accurate and precise results. Finally, based on our results, we recommend a sequential approach incorporating a pilot study and simulations for optimizing time and resources in large mammal genetic census studies.

Looking in apes as a source of human pathogens,"['Keita, MB', 'Hamad, I', 'Bittar, F']",MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS,10.1016/j.micpath.2014.09.003,DEC 2014,1,"Because of the close genetic relatedness between apes and humans, apes are susceptible to many human infectious agents and can serve as carriers of these pathogens. Consequently, they present a serious health hazard to humans. Moreover, many emerging infectious diseases originate in wildlife and continue to threaten human populations, especially vector-borne diseases described in great apes, such as malaria and rickettsiosis. These wild primates may be permanent reservoirs and important sources of human pathogens. In this special issue, we report that apes, including chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei), orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus and Pongo abelii), gibbons (Hylobates spp., Hoolock spp. and Nomascus spp) and siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus syndactylus and Symphalangus continentis), have many bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic species that are capable of infecting humans. Serious measures should be adopted in tropical forests and sub-tropical areas where habitat overlaps are frequent to survey and prevent infectious diseases from spreading from apes to people.

More food or fewer predators? The benefits to birds of associating with a Neotropical primate varies with their foraging strategy,"['Barnett, AA', 'Shaw, P']",JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,10.1111/jzo.12182,DEC 2014,1,"Although mixed-species associations of birds or primates have been well studied, primate-bird associations have received comparatively little attention. Additionally, benefits accruing with such associations have rarely been quantified. Over 13 months, 17 insectivorous bird species were observed associating with golden-backed uacaris. Detailed study of four found that feeding sally frequency significantly increased for sit-and-wait foragers (bronzy jacamar, Galbula leucogastra; black-fronted nunbird, Monasa nigrifrons), when uacaris were present within 14.9m, but not when within 15-30m. Contemporaneously, no significant differences were observed in peck bout frequency for two uacari-following bark- and leaf-gleaning antbirds (black-crested antshrike, Sakesphorus canadensis, black-winged antbird, Hypocnemoides melanopogon) when uacaris were present or absent. Antbird/uacari approximation is attributed to significant reductions in the presence of small bird-eating raptors when uacaris are present. Reasons for this are uncertain but may be because large raptors (e.g. harpy eagles) follow uacaris. So, while some bird species may gain foraging benefits from uacari presence, others may follow them because their proximity reduces predation risk. This appears foraging guild dependent. Except for work linking increased jacana peck rates with swamp-visiting gorilla presence, this study is the first to quantify benefits to birds of following primates, and the first such Neotropical study."
Identification of species-specific nuclear insertions of mitochondrial DNA (numts) in gorillas and their potential as population genetic markers,"['Soto-Calderon, ID', 'Clark, NJ', 'Wildschutte, JVH', 'DiMattio, K', 'Jensen-Seaman, MI', 'Anthony, NM']",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.ympev.2014.08.018,DEC 2014,3,"The first hyper-variable region (HV1) of the mitochondrial control region (MCR) has been widely used as a molecular tool in population genetics, but inadvertent amplification of nuclear translocated copies of mitochondrial DNA (numts) in gorillas has compromised the use of mitochondrial DNA in population genetic studies. At least three putative classes (I, II, III) of gorilla-specific HV1 MCR numts have been uncovered over the past decade. However, the number, size and location of numt loci in gorillas and other apes are completely unknown. Furthermore, little work to date has assessed the utility of numts as candidate population genetic markers. In the present study, we screened Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) genomic libraries in the chimpanzee and gorilla to compare patterns of mitochondrial-wide insertion in both taxa. We conducted an intensive BLAST search for numts in the gorilla genome and compared the prevalence of numt loci originating from the MCR with other great ape taxa. Additional gorilla-specific MCR numts were retrieved either through BAC library screens or using an anchored-PCR (A-PCR) amplification using genomic DNA from five unrelated gorillas. Locus-specific primers were designed to identify numt insertional polymorphisms and evaluate their potential as population genetic markers. Mitochondrial-wide surveys of chimpanzee and gorilla BACs showed that the number of numts does not differ between these two taxa. However, MCR numts are more abundant in chimpanzees than in other great apes. We identified and mapped 67 putative gorilla-specific numts, including two that contain the entire HV1 domain, cluster with sequences from two numt classes (I, IIb) and will likely co-amplify with mitochondrial sequences using most published HV1 primers. However, phylogenetic analysis coupled with post-hoc analysis of mitochondrial variation can successfully differentiate nuclear sequences. Insertional polymorphisms were evident in three out of five numts examined, indicating their potential utility as molecular markers. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potentially powerful insight that numts could make in uncovering population history in gorillas and other mammals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A Shared Pattern of Postnatal Endocranial Development in Extant Hominoids,"['Scott, N', 'Neubauer, S', 'Hublin, JJ', 'Gunz, P', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFRICANUS']",EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1007/s11692-014-9290-7,DEC 2014,3,"By comparing species-specific developmental patterns, we can approach the question of how development shapes adult morphology and contributes to the evolution of novel forms. Studies of evolutionary changes to brain development in primates can provide important clues about the emergence of human cognition, but are hindered by the lack of preserved neural tissue in the fossil record. As a proxy, we study the shape of endocasts, virtual imprints of the endocranial cavity, using 3D geometric morphometrics. We have previously demonstrated that the pattern of endocranial shape development is shared by modern humans, chimpanzees and Neanderthals after the first year of life until adulthood. However, whether this represents a common hominoid mode of development is unknown. Here, we present the first characterization and comparison of ontogenetic endocranial shape changes in a cross-sectional sample of modern humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and gibbons. Using developmental simulations, we demonstrate that from late infancy to adulthood ontogenetic trajectories are similar among all hominoid species, but differ in the amount of shape change. Furthermore, we show that during early ontogeny gorillas undergo more pronounced shape changes along this shared trajectory than do chimpanzees, indicative of a dissociation of size and shape change. As shape differences between species are apparent in even our youngest samples, our results indicate that the ontogenetic trajectories of extant hominoids diverged at an earlier stage of ontogeny but subsequently converge following the eruption of the deciduous dentition."
Plant Mineral Concentrations Related to Foraging Preferences of Western Lowland Gorilla in Central African Forest Clearings,"['Sienne, JM', 'Buchwald, R', 'Wittemyer, G']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22297,DEC 2014,0,"In the Central African rain forest, mineral resources essential to organisms are distributed heterogeneously.

In contrast, macronutrients appeared to play no major role in feeding plant selectivity with consumed species often having lower concentrations than non-consumed species. We found evidence for seasonal differences in Mg and Na concentrations, but the concentrations of other minerals in consumed plants were consistent across time.

Gorilla gorilla gorilla gut: a potential reservoir of pathogenic bacteria as revealed using culturomics and molecular tools","['Bittar, F', 'Keita, MB', 'Lagier, JC', 'Peeters, M', 'Delaporte, E', 'Raoult, D']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,10.1038/srep07174,NOV 24 2014,3,"Wild apes are considered to be the most serious reservoir and source of zoonoses. However, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. For this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 Gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis) were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. By applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. Many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; Mycobacterium bolletii, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum. The genus Treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. Using specific real-time PCR on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria Bartonella spp. Borrelia spp., Coxiella burnetii and Tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. We estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. Therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence."

Compositional change in the microbiome was slow and clock-like during African ape diversification, but human microbiomes have deviated from the ancestral state at an accelerated rate. Relative to the microbiomes of wild apes, human microbiomes have lost ancestral microbial diversity while becoming specialized for animal-based diets. Individual wild apes cultivate more phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species of bacteria than do individual humans across a range of societies. These results indicate that humanity has experienced a depletion of the gut flora since diverging from Pan."
"Liat1, an arginyltransferase-binding protein whose evolution among primates involved changes in the numbers of its 10-residue repeats","['Brower, CS', 'Rosen, CE', 'Jones, RH', 'Wadas, BC', 'Piatkov, KI', 'Varshavsky, A']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1419587111,NOV 18 2014,0,"The arginyltransferase Ate1 is a component of the N-end rule pathway, which recognizes proteins containing N-terminal degradation signals called N-degrons, polyubiquitylates these proteins, and thereby causes their degradation by the proteasome. At least six isoforms of mouse Ate1 are produced through alternative splicing of Ate1 pre-mRNA. We identified a previously uncharacterized mouse protein, termed Liat1 (ligand of Ate1), that interacts with Ate1 but does not appear to be its arginylation substrate. Liat1 has a higher affinity for the isoforms Ate1(1A7A) and Ate1(1B7A). Liat1 stimulated the in vitro N-terminal arginylation of a model substrate by Ate1. All examined vertebrate and some invertebrate genomes encode proteins sequelogous (similar in sequence) to mouse Liat1. Sequelogs of Liat1 share a highly conserved similar to 30-residue region that is shown here to be required for the binding of Liat1 to Ate1. We also identified non-Ate1 proteins that interact with Liat1. In contrast to Liat1 genes of nonprimate mammals, Liat1 genes of primates are subtelomeric, a location that tends to confer evolutionary instability on a gene. Remarkably, Liat1 proteins of some primates, from macaques to humans, contain tandem repeats of a 10-residue sequence, whereas Liat1 proteins of other mammals contain a single copy of this motif. Quantities of these repeats are, in general, different in Liat1 of different primates. For example, there are 1, 4, 13, 13, 17, and 17 repeats in the gibbon, gorilla, orangutan, bonobo, neanderthal, and human Liat1, respectively, suggesting that repeat number changes in this previously uncharacterized protein may contribute to evolution of primates."

Aims: To evaluate the impact of close contact with humans on the occurrence of potentially zoonotic protists in great apes, one hundred mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) from seven groups habituated either for tourism or for research in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda were screened for the presence of microsporidia, Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. using molecular diagnostics.

Results: The most frequently detected parasites were Enterocytozoon bieneusi found in 18 samples (including genotype EbpA, D, C, gorilla 2 and five novel genotypes gorilla 4-8) and Encephalitozoon cuniculi with genotype II being more prevalent (10 cases) compared to genotype I (1 case). Cryptosporidium muris (2 cases) and C. meleagridis (2 cases) were documented in great apes for the first time. Cryptosporidium sp. infections were identified only in research groups and occurrence of E. cuniculi in research groups was significantly higher in comparison to tourist groups. No difference in prevalence of E. bieneusi was observed between research and tourist groups.

Conclusion: Although our data showed the presence and diversity of important opportunistic protists in Volcanoes gorillas, the source and the routes of the circulation remain unknown. Repeated individual sampling, broad sampling of other hosts sharing the habitat with gorillas and quantification of studied protists would be necessary to acquire more complex data."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of gastric and enterohepatic Helicobacter species in African chimpanzees and gorillas. Fresh fecal samples were collected from wild endangered chimpanzees and critically endangered western lowland gorillas from different African National Parks, as well as wild-born captive animals from primate sanctuaries. Intact Helicobacter bacteria were demonstrated in feces by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Screening using a Helicobacter genus-specific PCR revealed the presence of Helicobacter DNA in the majority of animals in all groups. Cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments revealed a high homology to sequences from various zoonotic enterohepatic Helicobacter species, including H. cinaedi and H. canadensis. A number of gorillas and chimpanzees also tested positive using PCR assays designed to amplify part of the ureAB gene cluster and the hsp60 gene of gastric helicobacters. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of a putative novel zoonotic gastric Helicobacter taxon/species. For this species, we propose the name 'Candidatus Helicobacter homininae', pending isolation and further genetic characterization. The presence of several Helicobacter species not only implies a possible health threat for these endangered great apes, but also a possible zoonotic transmission of gastric and enterohepatic helicobacters from these primate reservoirs to humans.

Mountain gorillas acquire the majority of their minerals from herbaceous leaves, which constitute the bulk of their diet. However, less commonly eaten foods were sometimes found to be higher in specific minerals, suggesting their potential importance. A principal component analysis demonstrated little correlation among minerals in food items, which further suggests that mountain gorillas might increase dietary diversity to obtain a full complement of minerals in their diet.

Even if they were to follow currently accepted best-practice principles, we find that these actions may still fail to contribute to conservation objectives over the long term. We advocate for an alternative approach in which biodiversity offset and compensation projects are designed and implemented as part of a National Offset Strategy that (1) takes into account the cumulative impacts of development in individual countries, (2) identifies priority offset sites, (3) promotes aggregated offsets, and (4) integrates biodiversity offset and compensation projects with national biodiversity conservation objectives. We also propose supplementary principles necessary for biodiversity offsets to contribute to great ape conservation in Africa. Caution should still be exercised, however, with regard to offsets until further field-based evidence of their effectiveness is available."

We used analysis of autosomal DNA genotypes obtained from non-invasively collected faecal samples to estimate the evolutionary histories of the two extant mountain gorilla populations and the closely related eastern lowland gorillas. Our results suggest that eastern lowland gorillas and mountain gorillas split beginning some 10 000 years ago, followed 5000 years ago by the split of the two mountain gorilla populations of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and the Virungas Massif. All three populations have decreased in effective population size, with particularly substantial 10- fold decreases for the mountain gorillas. These dynamics probably reflect responses to habitat changes resulting from climate fluctuations over the past 20 000 years as well as increasing human influence in this densely populated region in the last several thousand years."

We characterized microbial populations in fecal cultures from gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), Hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas) and binturongs (Arctictis binturong) to compare the microbiomes associated with different gastrointestinal morphologies and different omnivorous feeding strategies. Each species was fed a distinct standardized diet for 2 weeks prior to fecal collection. All diets were formulated to reflect the species' feeding strategies in situ. Fresh fecal samples were pooled within species and used to inoculate in vitro batch cultures. Acetate, propionate, butyrate and valerate were measured after 24 h of incubation. Eubacterial DNA was extracted from individual fecal samples, pooled, and the cpn60 gene region was amplified and then sequenced to identify the major eubacterial constituents associated with each host species. Short chain fatty acids (P < 0.001) and methane (P < 0.001) were significantly different across species. Eubacterial profiles were consistent with fermentation data and suggest an increase in diversity with dietary fiber."

In 2012, the decision was made to retire a large number of laboratory chimpanzees in the United States of America. Relocation of these animals to sanctuaries, rescue centres, and zoos involve several changes in environment and husbandry routines. Because these animals often have a history of maternal deprivation, and consequently may suffer from an increased sensitivity to stress, these management changes may affect their behaviour. In The Netherlands, six groups of adult chimpanzees (n = 28), which were removed from their mother when juvenile and were hand or peer reared, were relocated from a biomedical laboratory to substantially larger enclosures at a Dutch sanctuary. This sanctuary applied different animal management routines. It was studied whether long-term agonistic, affiliative, and abnormal behaviour was affected by the relocation and alteration in behavioural management. The chimpanzees' behaviour was observed at the laboratory and during four years at the sanctuary, which resulted in 309 h of observational data. Results indicated that the chimpanzees performed more allogrooming and less aggressive interactions at the sanctuary compared to the laboratory. However, abnormal behaviour was performed more often at the sanctuary. These results suggest that additional measures should be taken to enhance the welfare level of chimpanzees, at least for those that have a history of maternal deprivation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of the forearm rotational efficiency in extant hominoids: New insights into the functional implications of upper limb skeletal structure,"['Ibanez-Gimeno, P', 'Galtes, I', 'Manyosa, J', 'Malgosa, A', 'Jordana, X', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.08.004,NOV 2014,0,"The greatly diversified locomotor behaviors in the Hominoidea impose different mechanical requirements in the upper limb of each species. As forearm rotation has a major role in locomotion, the skeletal structures involved in this movement may display differences among taxa that reflect functional adaptations. To test this, we use a biomechanical model that quantifies the rotatory capacity of pronator teres (rotational efficiency) from skeletal measurements. Using a large sample of hominoids, we aim to identify the morphological adaptations that confer differences in the mechanics of forearm motion and to assess the functional advantage of these adaptations. Forearm positions along the pronation supination range where rotational efficiency is maximal depend on the orientation of the humeral medial epicondyle and differ among taxa. Our results indicate that these are related to locomotor mode. Knuckle-walkers exhibit a medial epicondyle more posteriorly directed, which, in elbow angles close to extension, causes rotational efficiency to be maximal in pronated positions of the forearm. Species with a significant amount of arboreal locomotion, such as vertical climbing, i.e.. Pongo spp., Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla, display more proximally oriented epicondyles, which, in elbow flexion, leads to maximum rotational efficiencies in supinated positions of the forearm. Hylobatidae, with the less posteriorly and proximally oriented epicondyle, show their maximum rotational efficiencies closer to the forearm neutral position throughout most of the flexion extension range, which may be linked to brachiation in this taxon. In humans, the epicondylar orientation and thus the positions of the maximum rotational efficiencies fall between arboreal and terrestrial hominoids. This may be related to the enhanced manipulative skills of the upper limb. In conclusion, the current analysis indicates that the orientation of the humeral medial epicondyle is linked to the locomotor habits of extant hominoids and therefore can be used for locomotor inferences in fossil taxa.

Recent studies have shown that our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees, experience little to no volumetric decline in gray and white matter over the adult lifespan. However, these previous studies were limited with a small sample of chimpanzees of the most advanced ages. In the present study, we sought to further test for potential age-related decline in cortical organization in chimpanzees by expanding the sample size of aged chimpanzees. We used the BrainVisa software to measure total brain volume, gray and white matter volumes, gray matter thickness, and gyrification index in a cross-sectional sample of 219 captive chimpanzees (8-53 years old), with 38 subjects being 40 or more years of age. Mean depth and cortical fold opening of 11 major sulci of the chimpanzee brains were also measured. We found that chimpanzees showed increased gyrification with age and a cubic relationship between age and white matter volume. For the association between age and sulcus depth and width, the results were mostly non-significant with the exception of one negative correlation between age and the fronto-orbital sulcus. In short, results showed that chimpanzees exhibit few age-related changes in global cortical organization, sulcus folding and sulcus width. These findings support previous studies and the theory that the age-related changes in the human brain is due to an extended lifespan. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

However, few studies have assessed hand preference in the natural repertoire of motor behaviours in nonhuman primates, especially in actions that differ in velocity. Nevertheless, velocity is involved in the coordination between the upper limb joints and could be related to cerebral hemispheric specialization. Indeed, depending on the velocity, some joints, and so some muscles, are used more than others. The purpose of this study was to quantify hand preference across various natural actions to evaluate how the nature of the action modifies hand preference in capuchin and squirrel monkeys. First, we observed seven female tufted capuchin monkeys during spontaneous foraging, performing fast actions (pounding and capturing fast-moving prey) and slow actions (picking fruit, carrying, tapping and catching slow-moving prey). Second, we observed seven squirrel monkeys performing fast actions (capturing fast-moving prey) and slow actions (picking fruit and catching slow-moving prey) in their enclosure. The results showed that (1) capturing fast-moving prey and pounding were associated with a left-hand preference and (2) slow actions were associated with variable hand preferences. Fast manual actions may elicit consistent hand preference. Given that many nonhuman primates use fast actions to capture prey, this possibility deserves further investigation. If this finding is confirmed, a novel link between motor control processes and hand preference can be pursued. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

African Great Apes Are Naturally Infected with Roseoloviruses Closely Related to Human Herpesvirus 7,"['Lavergne, A', 'Donato, D', 'Gessain, A', 'Niphuis, H', 'Nerrienet, E', 'Verschoor, EJ', 'Lacoste, V']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.01490-14,NOV 2014,0,"Primates are naturally infected with herpesviruses. During the last 15 years, the search for homologues of human herpesviruses in nonhuman primates allowed the identification of numerous viruses belonging to the different herpesvirus subfamilies and genera. No simian homologue of human herpesvirus 7 (HHV7) has been reported to date. To investigate the putative existence of HHV7-like viruses in African great apes, we applied the consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers (CODEHOP) program-mediated PCR strategy to blood DNA samples from the four common chimpanzee subspecies (Pan troglodytes verus, P. t. ellioti, P. t. troglodytes, and P. t. schweinfurthii), pygmy chimpanzees (Pan paniscus), as well as lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). This study led to the discovery of a novel roseolovirus close to HHV7 in each of these nonhuman primate species and subspecies. Generation of the partial glycoprotein B (1,111-bp) and full-length DNA polymerase (3,036/3,042-bp) gene sequences allowed the deciphering of their evolutionary relationships. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HHV7 and its African great ape homologues formed well-supported monophyletic lineages whose topological resemblance to the host phylogeny is suggestive of virus-host codivergence. Notably, the evolutionary branching points that separate HHV7 from African great ape herpesvirus 7 are remarkably congruent with the dates of divergence of their hosts. Our study shows that African great apes are hosts of human herpesvirus homologues, including HHV7 homologues, and that the latter, like other DNA viruses that establish persistent infections, have cospeciated with their hosts.

IMPORTANCE

Human herpesviruses are known to possess simian homologues. However, surprisingly, none has been identified to date for human herpesvirus 7 (HHV7). This study is the first to describe simian homologues of HHV7. The extensive search performed on almost all African great ape species and subspecies, i.e., common chimpanzees of the four subspecies, bonobos, and lowland gorillas, has allowed characterization of a specific virus in each. Genetic characterization of the partial glycoprotein B and fulllength DNA polymerase gene sequences, followed by their phylogenetic analysis and estimation of divergence times, has shed light on the evolutionary relationships of these viruses. In this respect, we conclusively demonstrate the cospeciation between these new viruses and their hosts and report cases of cross-species transmission between two common chimpanzee subspecies in both directions."

SFV can be transmitted to humans, giving rise to a persistent infection. Only a few data are available concerning the distribution of SFV in human blood cells. Here we purified blood mononuclear cell subsets from 11 individuals infected with a Gorilla gorilla SFV strain and quantified SFV DNA levels by quantitative PCR. SFV DNA was detected in the majority of the CD8(+), CD4(+), and CD19(+) lymphocyte samples and rarely in CD14(+) monocyte and CD56(+) NK lymphocyte samples. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) SFV DNA counts were 16.0 (11.0 to 49.8), 11.3 (5.9 to 28.3), and 17.2 (2.0 to 25.2) copies/105 cells in CD8(+) T lymphocytes, CD4(+) T lymphocytes, and CD19(+) B lymphocytes, respectively. In the CD4 compartment, SFV DNA was detected in both memory and naive CD4(+) T lymphocytes. SFV DNA levels in CD4(+) T cells were positively correlated with the duration of the infection. Our study shows with a quantitative method that CD8(+), CD4(+), and B lymphocytes are major cellular targets of SFV in the blood of infected humans.

IMPORTANCE

Investigation of SFV infections in humans is important due to the origin of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and human T cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) from cross-species transmission of their simian counterparts to humans. Surprisingly little is known about many aspects of the biology of SFV in infected humans, including quantitative data concerning the cellular targets of SFV in vivo. Here we show that the distribution of SFV DNA among the different leukocyte populations is not homogeneous and that viral load in CD4(+) T lymphocytes is correlated with the duration of infection. These new data will help in understanding the biology of retroviral infections in humans and can be useful in the growing field of SFV-based gene therapy."

A total of 215 cynomolgus monkeys originally from Cambodia (61), China (5), Indonesia (125), and Mauritius (24) were used for this investigation. From each animal, usually 2 liver samples were processed for histopathology with 2 sections in each slide. An MNH was defined as a hepatocyte with 3 or more nuclei. A threshold of 3 MNHs was selected for the Multinucleated Hepatocyte Grading System: 0 = not remarkable (3 MNHs counted from 2-4 liver sections), minimal = 4 to 15 MNHs, mild = 16 to 30 MNHs, moderate = 31 to 59 MNHs, and severe 60 MNHs. The incidence of MNHs was 60 of 86 (70%) in males and 72 of 129 (56%) in females for a total overall incidence of 132 of 215 animals (61%). Affected hepatocytes were frequently observed close to the capsule and generally had 3 to 8 nuclei per hepatocyte but as many as 15 occurred in a single cell. Awareness of the incidence of MNHs in cynomolgus monkeys is important for potential use as background data in preclinical safety and toxicity evaluation studies."

In most other mammals, including apes and Australopithecus afarensis, pisiforms are elongate. An underappreciated fact is that the typical mammalian pisiform forms from two ossification centers. We hypothesize that: (i) the presence of a secondary ossification center in mammalian pisiforms indicates the existence of a growth plate; and (ii) human pisiform reduction results from growth plate loss. To address these hypotheses, we surveyed African ape pisiform ossification and confirmed the presence of a late-forming secondary ossification center in chimpanzees and gorillas. Identification of the initial ossification center occurs substantially earlier in apes relative to humans, raising questions concerning the homology of the human pisiform and the two mammalian ossification centers. Second, we conducted histological and immunohistochemical analyses of pisiform ossification in mice. We confirm the presence of two ossification centers separated by organized columnar and hypertrophic chondrocyte zones. Flattened chondrocytes were highly mitotic, indicating the presence of a growth plate. Hox genes have been proposed to play a fundamental role in growth plate patterning. The existence of a pisiform growth plate presents an interesting test case for the association between Hox expression and growth plate formation, and could explain the severe effects on the pisiform observed in Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 knockout mice. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that Hoxd11 is expressed adjacent to the pisiform in late-stage embryonic mouse limbs supporting a role for Hox genes in growth plate specification. This raises questions concerning the mechanisms regulating Hox expression in the developing carpus."
Complete Mitochondrial Genome Sequence of the Eastern Gorilla (Gorilla beringei) and Implications for African Ape Biogeography,"['Das, R', 'Hergenrother, SD', 'Soto-Calderon, ID', 'Dew, JL', 'Anthony, NM', 'Jensen-Seaman, MI']",JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,10.1093/jhered/esu056,NOV-DEC 2014,0,"The Western and Eastern species of gorillas (Gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei) began diverging in the mid-Pleistocene, but in a complex pattern with ongoing gene flow following their initial split. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of 1 Eastern and 1 Western gorilla to provide the most accurate date for their mitochondrial divergence, and to analyze patterns of nucleotide substitutions. The most recent common ancestor of these genomes existed about 1.9 million years ago, slightly more recent than that of chimpanzee and bonobo. We in turn use this date as a calibration to reanalyze sequences from the Eastern lowland and mountain gorilla subspecies to estimate their mitochondrial divergence at approximately 380000 years ago. These dates help frame a hypothesis whereby populations became isolated nearly 2 million years ago with restricted maternal gene flow, followed by ongoing male migration until the recent past. This process of divergence with prolonged hybridization occurred against the backdrop of the African Pleistocene, characterized by intense fluctuations in temperature and aridity, while at the same time experiencing tectonic uplifting and consequent shifts in the drainage of major river systems. Interestingly, this same pattern of introgression following divergence and discrepancies between mitochondrial and nuclear loci is seen in fossil hominins from Eurasia, suggesting that such processes may be common in hominids and that living gorillas may provide a useful model for understanding isolation and migration in our extinct relatives."

Western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) offer an opportunity to investigate these issues because their vocal repertoire includes a loud, long-distance call (i.e., hoot series) that is potentially used in within-group communication, whereas mountain gorillas use an identical call exclusively during intergroup encounters. First, we tested whether the hoot series functions as a contact/separation call. Second, we examined which individuals were more likely to reply and which party was more responsible for decreasing distance to identify the underlying mechanisms and cognitive implications of hoot series. We collected behavioral, spatial, and acoustic data on five adult gorillas over 15 months at the Mondika Research Center (Republic of Congo and CAR). Hoot series are individually distinct calls and given by both male and female gorillas when separated from each other. Following hooting, the distance between separated group members decreased significantly; thus we concluded that western gorillas use this call to reestablish group cohesion. The way in which proximity was achieved depended upon listeners replying or not to the caller. Replies may indicate a conflict between callers about intended travel direction, with vocal interchanges serving to negotiate a consensus. Although the acoustic features of vocal signals are highly constrained in closely related species, our results demonstrate that the function and usage of particular calls can be flexible.

Proximate mechanisms of contest competition among female Bwindi mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei),"['Wright, E', 'Robbins, MM']",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,10.1007/s00265-014-1788-6,NOV 2014,0,"Socioecological models provide a framework for predicting how animals respond competitively to the abundance and distribution of food resources. Testing predictions of socioecological models requires analysis of relationships among food resource characteristics, competitive behaviors, and measures of rank-related skew in energy balance or reproductive success. A positive relationship between dominance rank and energy balance has been observed among female mountain gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. This study examines the proximate mechanisms underlying feeding competition among those females. To assess the contestability of food resources, we measured the time a female spent feeding at a food site (food site residence time). We also examined the relationship between dominance rank and the access to resources, as well as the rate, context, and direction of aggression, and the number of neighbors in close proximity. As predicted, females had longer food site residence times and higher aggression rates with fruit and decaying wood than with herbaceous vegetation, suggesting that those resources may be contestable. Aggression was predominantly directed down the dominance hierarchy, although against expectation, rank was not significantly correlated with aggression rates or the time spent feeding on contestable foods. Higher-ranking females had significantly fewer neighbors, suggesting that lower-ranking females avoid higher-ranking ones. This study provides additional support for the claim that there is variability in how primates respond to the quality and distribution of food resources and that avoidance as a strategy to cope with feeding competition may result in similar skew in energy balance as rank-related aggression."
Does hunting threaten timber regeneration in selectively logged tropical forests?,"['Rosin, C']",FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,10.1016/j.foreco.2014.08.001,NOV 1 2014,2,"Avoiding the conversion of tropical production forests to non-forest land uses is a forestry and conservation priority, and is contingent on successful regeneration of commercially important species. The underlying ecological processes that facilitate regeneration, however, are poorly understood. Perhaps as a result, timber yields after regeneration can be lower than expected. Hunting is widespread in timber concessions, and may threaten regeneration by disrupting the various processes facilitated by wildlife. Vertebrate seed dispersers are often heavily hunted, resulting in reduced seed movement for many species and a shift in community composition to favor those plants dispersed by small animals and abiotic means. Timber species with large seeds and fleshy fruit are at particular risk for dispersal and recruitment failure. Hunting also alters granivore communities, resulting in increased predation on species favored by insects and small rodents, and changing the spatial template of seed predation, with detrimental effects on many timber species. Large vertebrate herbivores decline with hunting pressure, resulting in the modification of plant competitive interactions. This is disadvantageous to several traits that are common among timber trees, including relatively slow growth and high wood density. A lack of appreciation for and management of these interactions could threaten forest biodiversity, limit future timber production, and increase the likelihood of forest conversion for other land uses. In this review, I highlight the plant-animal interactions that could influence timber regeneration in tropical forests, as well as how these processes might be expected to change under hunting pressure. The review concludes with recommendations for management and future research priorities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Yet our knowledge of the cognitive processes involved in decisions remains limited. We tested capuchins, macaques and orang-utans in a food-gambling task to investigate whether or not individuals estimate the chances of different outcomes. Results highlighted that gambling decisions were negatively induced by the probability of losing and the frequency of previous losses, and positively induced by the probability of gaining. Actual decisions were consistent with first order stochastic dominance. The study of second order stochastic dominance revealed that macaques were risk-prone whereas capuchins and orang-utans were risk-adverse. We detected responses comparable to the hot-hand effect, a bias found in humans. Capuchins and orang-utans exhibited probability distortion and loss aversion, which were not systematically found in macaques. Given the heterogeneity among individuals, we implemented mixture models and showed that attitudes towards risk and probabilities play complementary and different roles in the three species."
Food Neophobia and Social Learning Opportunities in Great Apes,"['Gustafsson, E', 'Saint Jalme, M', 'Bomsel, MC', 'Krief, S']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-014-9796-y,OCT 2014,2,"Finding food resources and maintaining a balanced diet are major concerns for all animals.

However, little is known about how primates respond to novel food items and whether their use is socially transmitted. By comparing how four different species of great apes respond to novel food items, we investigated how differences in physiology (digestive tract size and microbial content), habitats (predictability of food availability), and social systems (group size and composition) affect their response toward novelty. We presented two familiar foods, one novel fruit, four novel aromatic plants from herbal medicine, and kaolin to captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii). We recorded smelling, approach-taste delays, ingestion, interindividual observations, and food transfers with continuous sampling. We found that behaviors differed between the apes: chimpanzees were the most cautious species and observed their conspecifics handling the items more frequently than the other apes. Close observations and food transfers were extremely rare in gorillas in comparison to orangutans and chimpanzees. We suggest that a low neophobia level reflects an adaptive response to digestive physiological features in gorillas and to unpredictable food availability in orangutans. Social interactions appeared to be predominant in chimpanzees and in both orangutan species to overcome food neophobia. They reflect higher social tolerance and more opportunities for social learning and cultural transmission in a feeding context."
A species' Odyssey: evolution of obstetrical mechanics from Australopithecus Lucy to nowadays,"['Chene, G', 'Tardieu, AS', 'Trombert, B', 'Amouzougan, A', 'Lamblin, G', 'Mellier, G', 'Coppens, Y']",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2014.08.027,OCT 2014,2,"Objective: Study of obstetrical mechanics of Australopithecus Lucy, Homo neanderthalensis and Homo erectus relative to modern Homo sapiens and the Catarrhines.

Study design: The material comprised a total of 360 pelves: 3 fossil pelves reconstructed using casts (Australopithecus afarensis Lucy or AL 288-1, Homo erectus KNM-WT 15000, H. neanderthalensis or Kebara 2), 305 female modern adult pelves and 52 female Catarrhine pelves (29 gorillas, 18 chimpanzees, 5 orang-utans). All these pelves were reconstructed in order to carry out 11 pelvimetric measurements. Each measurement was carried out twice and by two different operators.

Results: The pelvis of Lucy was platypelloid at each pelvic plane. The pelvic inlet of H. neanderthalensis was anteroposteriorly oval whereas the midplane and the outlet were transversely oval. The pelvis of H. erectus was globally round. In modern women, the inlet was transversely oval. The pelvic midplane and outlet were anteroposteriorly oval. In the great apes, the shape of all three pelvic planes was anteroposteriorly oval.

The discriminating value of the various pelvimetry measurements place Australopithecus Lucy, H. neanderthalensis Kebara 2, and H. erectus KNM-WT 15000 close to modern humans and less similar to the great apes.

Conclusion: Obstetrical mechanics evolved from dystocic delivery with a transverse orientation in Australopithecus to delivery with a modern human-like rotational birth and an increase in the anteroposterior diameters in H. erectus, H. neanderthalensis and modern H. sapiens.

VALIDATION OF FLOTAC FOR THE DETECTION AND QUANTIFICATION OF TROGLODYTELLA ABRASSARTI AND NEOBALANTIDIUM COLI IN CHIMPANZEES AND PIGS,"['Ruzicova, M', 'Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Kalousova, B', 'Modry, D', 'Pomajbikova, K']",JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY,10.1645/14-505.1,OCT 2014,0,"We carried out a calibration of FLOTAC for ciliates Troglodytella abrassarti and Neobalantidium coli based on the selection of a most appropriate flotation solutions, and we also tested its accuracy (i.e., number of detected stages out of known added number of stages to fecal samples) and sensitivity for trophozoites of both ciliates in chimpanzee feces and N. coli cysts in pig feces, compared the detection threshold of FLOTAC with MIF-based sedimentation, and, subsequently, tested the losses of ciliate stages during sample preparation. Nine flotation solutions were evaluated, and ZnSO4 solution (specific gravity [s.g.] 1.2) showed to be the most suitable for trophozoite detection, while Sheather's solution (s.g. 1.33) was selected as most suitable for cysts. The FLOTAC sensitivity in detection of both stages varied: for trophozoites, we found all samples were positive when the intensity of infection 10 trophozoites per gram and higher, whereas for cysts the sensitivity was lower. The accuracy of FLOTAC negatively correlated with infection intensity, and the merthiolate-iodine-formaldehyde sedimentation-based quantification had a lower detection threshold. We demonstrated additional losses of stages of T. abrassarti and N. coli due to their retention in the sediment, which is probably a major reason for discrepancies in the numbers of countable ciliates between both methods. In conclusion, the FLOTAC should not be considered as a gold standard for quantification of intestinal ciliates in primates; instead, we recommend the modified MIF method."
Abstract Knowledge in the Broken-String Problem: Evidence from Nonhuman Primates and Pre-Schoolers,"['Mayer, C', 'Call, J', 'Albiach-Serrano, A', 'Visalberghi, E', 'Sabbatini, G', 'Seed, A']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0108597,OCT 1 2014,2,"There is still large controversy about whether abstract knowledge of physical problems is uniquely human. We presented 9 capuchin monkeys, 6 bonobos, 6 chimpanzees and 48 children with two versions of a broken-string problem. In the standard condition, participants had to choose between an intact and a broken string as means to a reward. In the critical condition, the functional parts of the strings were covered up and replaced by perceptually similar, but non-functional cues. Apes, monkeys and young children performed significantly better in the standard condition in which the cues played a functional role, indicating knowledge of the functional properties involved. Moreover, a control experiment with chimpanzees and young children ruled out that this difference in performance could be accounted for by differences of perceptual feedback in the two conditions. We suggest that, similar to humans, nonhuman primates partly rely on abstract concepts in physical problem-solving."
Variance in the reproductive success of dominant male mountain gorillas,"['Robbins, AM', 'Gray, M', 'Uwingeli, P', 'Mburanumwe, I', 'Kagoda, E', 'Robbins, MM', 'VERREAUXS SIFAKA']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-014-0426-2,OCT 2014,3,"Using 30 years of demographic data from 15 groups, this study estimates how harem size, female fertility, and offspring survival may contribute to variance in the siring rates of dominant male mountain gorillas throughout the Virunga Volcano Region. As predicted for polygynous species, differences in harem size were the greatest source of variance in the siring rate, whereas differences in female fertility and offspring survival were relatively minor. Harem size was positively correlated with offspring survival, even after removing all known and suspected cases of infanticide, so the correlation does not seem to reflect differences in the ability of males to protect their offspring. Harem size was not significantly correlated with female fertility, which is consistent with the hypothesis that mountain gorillas have minimal feeding competition. Harem size, offspring survival, and siring rates were not significantly correlated with the proportion of dominant tenures that occurred in multimale groups versus one-male groups; even though infanticide is less likely when those tenures end in multimale groups than one-male groups. In contrast with the relatively small contribution of offspring survival to variance in the siring rates of this study, offspring survival is a major source of variance in the male reproductive success of western gorillas, which have greater predation risks and significantly higher rates of infanticide. If differences in offspring protection are less important among male mountain gorillas than western gorillas, then the relative importance of other factors may be greater for mountain gorillas. Thus, our study illustrates how variance in male reproductive success and its components can differ between closely related species."
Double invisible displacement understanding in orangutans: testing in non-locomotor and locomotor space,"['Mallavarapu, S', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Perdue, BM', 'Maple, TL']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-014-0439-x,OCT 2014,0,"The nonadjacent double invisible displacement task has been used to test for the ability of different species to mentally represent the unperceived trajectory of an object. The task typically requires three occluders/boxes in a linear array and involves hiding an object in one of two nonadjacent boxes visited in succession. Previous research indicates that 19-, 26-, and 30-month-old children and various nonhuman species cannot solve these displacements. It has been hypothesized that this is because individuals are unable to inhibit searching in the unbaited center box that was never visited by the experimenter. It has been suggested that presenting the task in a large-scale locomotor space might allow individuals to overcome this inhibition problem. In the present study, we tested orangutans on adjacent and nonadjacent double invisible displacements with the traditional setup (experiment 1) and in locomotor space with boxes placed 1.22 m apart (experiment 2). In both experiments, subjects were able to solve adjacent, but not nonadjacent, trials. The failure on nonadjacent trials appeared to be because of an inability to inhibit sequential search on the second choice as well as because of a large number of first-choice errors (directly choosing an incorrect box). The current results support previous findings that orangutans exhibit some constraints when representing the invisible trajectory of objects."
Human-Animal Relationships in Zoo-Housed Orangutans (P. abelii) and Gorillas (G. g. gorilla): The Effects of Familiarity,"['Smith, JJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22280,OCT 2014,0,"I examined human-animal relationships (HARs) in zoo-housed orangutans (Pongo abelii) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) to see if they followed patterns similar to conspecific relationships in great apes and humans. Familiarity and social relationships guide humans' and great apes' behaviors with conspecifics. Inter-individual relationships, based on shared social history, and ""generalized"" relationships, based on a history of interactions with relevant classes of individuals, guide behavior with familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics, respectively. I examined whether both familiarity and social relationships similarly guides great apes' cross-species interactions with humans. I used repeated measures MANOVA to compare hourly rates and average durations of ape-initiated human-directed behaviors (HDBs) between familiar and unfamiliar humans and between great ape species. HDB patterns were consistent with familiarity-based HAR predictions, indicating more negative relationships with unfamiliar humans and more positive relationships with familiar humans. Findings for unfamiliar humans are consistent with negative effects of humans on apes' behavior reported in traditional visitor effect studies (VES). However, findings for familiar humans may be overlooked in VES due to pooling across levels of human familiarity or failure to consider humans other than primarily unfamiliar visitors. Additionally, species differences in apes' HDBs suggest that data pooling across species, common in many zoo studies, may mask important differences. These findings have important methodological implications for studies of human-animal interaction as well as for captive animal wellbeing. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Informing Conservation Management About Structural Versus Functional Connectivity: A Case-Study of Cross River Gorillas,"['Imong, I', 'Robbins, MM', 'Mundry, R', 'Bergl, R', 'Kuhl, HS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22287,OCT 2014,1,"Connectivity among subpopulations is vital for the persistence of small and fragmented populations. For management interventions to be effective conservation planners have to make the critical distinction between structural connectivity (based on landscape structure) and functional connectivity (which considers both landscape structure and organism-specific behavioral attributes) which can differ considerably within a given context. We assessed spatial and temporal changes in structural and functional connectivity of the Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli (CRG) population in a 12,000km(2) landscape in the Nigeria-Cameroon border region over a 23-year period, comparing two periods: 19872000 and 2000-2010. Despite substantial forest connections between occupied areas, genetic evidence shows that only limited dispersal occurs among CRG subpopulations. We used remotely sensed land-cover data and simulated human pressure (using a spatially explicit agent-based model) to assess human impact on connectivity of the CRG population. We calculated cost-weighted distances between areas occupied by gorillas as measures of connectivity (structural based on land-cover only, functional based on both land-cover and simulated human pressure). Whereas structural connectivity decreased by 5% over the 23-year period, functional connectivity decreased by 11%, with both decreasing more during the latter compared to the earlier period. Our results highlight the increasing threat of isolation of CRG subpopulations due to human disturbance, and provide insight into how increasing human influence may lead to functional isolation of wildlife populations despite habitat continuity, a pressing and common issue in tropical Africa often not accounted for when deciding management interventions. In addition to quantifying threats to connectivity, our study provides crucial evidence for management authorities to identify actions that are more likely to be effective for conservation of species in human-dominated landscapes. Our approach can be easily applied to other species, regions, and scales. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

In this study, we cloned the full coding region of NR1H4 gene from porcine Longissimus dorsi by Rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE). Results indicated that the open reading frame of NR1H4 covered 1461 bp encoding 486 amino acid residues and the deduced amino acid sequence was 91-94 % identical to that of Homo sapiens, Bos taurus, Macaca mulatta, Gorilla gorilla, and Ovis aries. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that NR1H4 contained 31 phosphorylation sites with 14 serine, 6 threonine and 11 tyrosine. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected by PCR-RFLP in 3' untranslated region of exon 9 (NR1H4) and the allele frequency analysis showed that A allele frequency was low among 396 pigs from five breeds. The NR1H4 mRNA expression pattern showed that NR1H4 gene was expressed highly in live and Longissimus dorsi.

High diversity of MIC genes in non-human primates,"['Meyer, A', 'Carapito, R', 'Ott, L', 'Radosavljevic, M', 'Georgel, P', 'Adams, EJ', 'Parham, P', 'Bontrop, RE', 'Blancher, A', 'Bahram, S']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s00251-014-0791-4,OCT 2014,4,"The human MHC class I (MHC-I) chain-related genes A and B (MICA and MICB) encode stress-induced glycoproteins, ligands for the activating receptor NKG2D. They display an unusually high degree of polymorphism, next only to that of classical MHC-I. The functional relevance and selective pressure behind this peculiar polymorphism, which is quite distinct from that of classical MHC-I, remain largely unknown. This study increases the repertoire of allelic sequences determined for the MIC genes of non-human primates. Sequencing (mainly exons 2, 3, 4, 5) MIC genes of 72 Macaca fascicularis (Mafa), 63 Pan troglodytes (Patr), and 18 Gorilla gorilla (Gogo) individuals led to the identification of 35, 14, and 3 new alleles, respectively. Additionally, we confirm the existence of three independent MIC genes in M. fascicularis, i.e., Mafa-MICA, Mafa-MICB, and Mafa-MICB/A, the latter being a hybrid of Mafa-MICB and Mafa-MICA. By multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, we further demonstrate that the present day MIC genes most likely derive from a single human MICB-like ancestral gene."
Hypothesis: Brain size and skull shape as criteria for a new hominin family tree,"['Chardin, P', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-SEDIBA']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jchb.2013.11.006,2014,0,"Today, gorillas and chimpanzees live in tropical forests, where acid soils do not favor fossilization. It is thus widely believed that there are no fossils of chimpanzees or gorillas. However, four teeth of a 0.5-million-year (Ma)-old chimpanzee were discovered in the rift valley of Kenya (McBrearty and Jablonski, 2005), and a handful of teeth of a 10-Ma-old gorilla-like creature were found in Ethiopia (Suwa et al., 2007), close to the major sites of Homo discoveries. These discoveries indicate that chimpanzees and gorillas once shared their range with early Homo. However, the thousands of hominin fossils discovered in the past century have all been attributed to the Homo line. Thus far, our family tree looks like a bush with many dead-branches. If one admits the possibility that the australopithecines can also be the ancestors of African great apes, one can place Paranthropus on the side of gorilla ancestors and divide the remaining Australopithecus based on the brain size into the two main lines of humans and chimpanzees, thereby resulting in a coherent family tree.

Western lowland gorilla density and nesting behavior in a Gabonese forest logged for 25 years: implications for gorilla conservation,"['Haurez, B', 'Petre, CA', 'Vermeulen, C', 'Tagg, N', 'Doucet, JL']",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,10.1007/s10531-014-0743-1,OCT 2014,4,"The tropical forests of the Congo Basin constitute biodiversity refuges that still hold large numbers of species, including endemic and endangered vertebrates. Along with several key species, the critically endangered western lowland gorilla (WLG) potentially contributes to forest dynamics through seed dispersal. Considering the extensive influence of timber harvesting on tropical forest ecosystems, the survival of gorilla populations in logged forests might prove critical for forest ecosystem conservation. We estimated WLG density, through a nest count survey, in a forest in southeast Gabon that has been logged for 25 years. Nesting behavior and habitat use were described and we applied generalized linear models to identify the factors that influence gorilla day and night habitat use. The estimated density of weaned gorillas, 1.5 gorillas km(-2), is comparable with estimates from some protected areas and other sustainably managed sites within their range. Habitat type had the greatest influence on nest site distribution. We observed a preference for nesting in open terra firma forest, and open habitats in general, which supports the findings of previous studies. Habitat use during the day was strongly influenced by habitat type and human activities, and to a lesser degree by functional and non-functional roads, and rivers. Our results support the suggestion that logged forests are suitable habitats for WLG if hunting and poaching are controlled. We recommend collaborations between timber operators and scientists to improve the conservation potential of tropical forests and enhance the wildlife-management aspects of logging practices."
Testing the Effect of Medical Positive Reinforcement Training on Salivary Cortisol Levels in Bonobos and Orangutans,"['Behringer, V', 'Stevens, JMG', 'Hohmann, G', 'Mostl, E', 'Selzer, D', 'Deschner, T']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0108664,SEP 24 2014,0,"The management of captive animals has been improved by the establishment of positive reinforcement training as a tool to facilitate interactions between caretakers and animals. In great apes, positive reinforcement training has also been used to train individuals to participate in simple medical procedures to monitor physical health. One aim of positive reinforcement training is to establish a relaxed atmosphere for situations that, without training, might be very stressful. This is especially true for simple medical procedures that can require animals to engage in behaviours that are unusual or use unfamiliar medical devices that can be upsetting. Therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility that the training itself is a source of stress. In this study, we explored the effects of medical positive reinforcement training on salivary cortisol in two groups of captive ape species, orangutans and bonobos, which were familiar to this procedure. Furthermore, we successfully biologically validated the salivary cortisol assay, which had already been validated for bonobos, for orangutans. For the biological validation, we found that cortisol levels in orangutan saliva collected during baseline conditions were lower than in samples collected during three periods that were potentially stressful for the animals. However, we did not find significant changes in salivary cortisol during medical positive reinforcement training for either bonobos or orangutans. Therefore, for bonobos and orangutans with previous exposure to medical PRT, the procedure is not stressful. Thus, medical PRT provides a helpful tool for the captive management of the two species."
The Influence of Life History and Sexual Dimorphism on Entheseal Changes in Modern Humans and African Great Apes,"['Milella, M']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0107963,SEP 24 2014,1,"Entheseal changes have been widely studied with regard to their correlation to biomechanical stress and their usefulness for biocultural reconstructions. However, anthropological and medical studies have demonstrated the marked influence of both age and sex on the development of these features. Studies of entheseal changes are mostly aimed in testing functional hypotheses and are mostly focused on modern humans, with few data available for non-human primates. The lack of comparative studies on the effect of age and sex on entheseal changes represent a gap in our understanding of the evolutionary basis of both development and degeneration of the human musculoskeletal system. The aim of the present work is to compare age trajectories and patterns of sexual dimorphism in entheseal changes between modern humans and African great apes. To this end we analyzed 23 postcranial entheses in a human contemporary identified skeletal collection (N = 484) and compared the results with those obtained from the analysis of Pan (N = 50) and Gorilla (N = 47) skeletal specimens. Results highlight taxon-specific age trajectories possibly linked to differences in life history schedules and phyletic relationships. Robusticity trajectories separate Pan and modern humans from Gorilla, whereas enthesopathic patterns are unique in modern humans and possibly linked to their extended potential lifespan. Comparisons between sexes evidence a decreasing dimorphism in robusticity from Gorilla, to modern humans to Pan, which is likely linked to the role played by size, lifespan and physical activity on robusticity development. The present study confirms previous hypotheses on the possible relevance of EC in the study of life history, pointing moreover to their usefulness in evolutionary studies."

Herein, 35 eukaryotic primer sets targeting the 18S rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer gene and other specific genes were used firstly to explore the eukaryotes in a fecal sample from a wild western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Then specific real-time PCRs were achieved in additional 48 fecal samples from 21 individual gorillas to investigate the presence of human eukaryotic pathogens. In total, 1,572 clones were obtained and sequenced from the 15 cloning libraries, resulting in the retrieval of 87 eukaryotic species, including 52 fungi, 10 protozoa, 4 nematodes and 21 plant species, of which 52, 5, 2 and 21 species, respectively, have never before been described in gorillas. We also reported the occurrence of pathogenic fungi and parasites (i.e. Oesophagostomum bifurcum (86%), Necator americanus (43%), Candida tropicalis (81%) and other pathogenic fungi were identified). In conclusion, molecular techniques using multiple primer sets may offer an effective tool to study complex eukaryotic communities and to identify potential pathogens in the gastrointestinal tracts of primates."
Bayesian Estimation of the Phylogeography of African Gorillas with Genome-Differentiated Population Trees,"['Kim, J', 'Larget, B']",BIOMETRICS,10.1111/biom.12169,SEP 2014,0,"Phylogeography investigates the historical process that is responsible for the contemporary geographic distributions of populations in a species. The inference is made on the basis of molecular sequence data sampled from modern-day populations. The estimates, however, may fluctuate depending on the relevant genomic regions, because the evolution mechanism of each genome is unique, even within the same individual. In this article, we propose a genome-differentiated population tree model that allows the existence of separate population trees for each homologous genome. In each population tree, the unique evolutionary characteristics account for each genome, along with their homologous relationship; therefore, the approach can distinguish the evolutionary history of one genome from that of another. In addition to the separate divergence times, the new model can estimate separate effective population sizes, gene-genealogies and other mutation parameters. For Bayesian inference, we developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology with a novel MCMC algorithm which can mix over a complicated state space. The stability of the new estimator is demonstrated through comparison with the Monte Carlo samples and other methods, as well as MCMC convergence diagnostics. The analysis of African gorilla data from two homologous loci reveals discordant divergence times between loci, and this discrepancy is explained by male-mediated gene flows until the end of the last ice age."

Changes in social structure, such as the introduction of a new conspecific, can be a source of stress. In April 2010, a sexually mature female western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) was brought to Lincoln Park Zoo (LPZ; Chicago, IL) from the Chicago Zoological Park (Brookfield, IL) for a breeding recommendation from the Gorilla Species Survival Plan (R). Fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) were monitored in two gorillas prior to, during and immediately following the social introduction. Reproduction events, such ovarian cyclicity and pregnancy, were monitored using behavior and fecal progestagen metabolite (FPM; female) and fecal androgen metabolite (FAM; male) analyses. Mean (+/- standard error) FGM concentrations for the male were elevated (P = 0.002) during the introduction (20.61 +/- 0.83 ng/g) compared to the pre- and post-introduction phases (11.31 +/- 0.48 ng/g and 12.42 +/- 0.65 ng/g, respectively). For the female, mean FGM concentrations were lower (P < 0.001) during the post-introduction (17.91 +/- 1.07 ng/g) than during the pre-and introduction phases (30.50 +/- 3.42 and 27.38 +/- 1.51 ng/g, respectively). The female maintained normal FPM cyclicity throughout the study and became pregnant in the post-introduction phase. These results suggest the importance of both behavioral and physiological monitoring of zoo animals and demonstrate the potential stress that can occur during social introductions.

This survey serves as a follow-up to a 1995 dietary survey of zoo-housed gorillas and goes further to quantify nutritional profiles at responding institutions. Results are encouraging, as zoos have made clear improvements in dietary nutrient profiles offered over the past 15 years.

The Birth of an Infant Decreases Group Spacing in a Zoo-Housed Lowland Gorilla Group (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Kurtycz, LM', 'Shender, MA', 'Ross, SR']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21156,SEP-OCT 2014,1,"Changes in group composition can alter the behavior of social animals such as gorillas. Although gorilla births are presumed to affect group spacing patterns, there is relatively little data about how these events affect gorilla group cohesion. We investigated how members of a western lowland gorilla group (n = 6) at Lincoln Park Zoo (Chicago, IL, USA) spaced themselves prior to and after the birth of an infant, to investigate changes in group cohesion. Gorillas were housed in an indoor-outdoor enclosure in which access to the outdoors was permitted when temperatures exceeded 5 degrees C. We recorded spatial locations of each group member using 30-min group scans on tablet computers with an electronic map interface, as well as noting their access to outdoor areas. Data from the 4 months following the birth was compared to a control period corresponding to early pregnancy. We measured distances between all possible group dyads for each scan and subsequently calculated a mean distance between all group members. An ANOVA revealed that access to the outdoors had no effect on group spacing (F(1,56) = 0.066, P = 0.799). However, the presence of an infant resulted in a significant reduction in inter-individual distance (F(1,56) = 23.988, P = 0.000), decreasing inter-individual spacing by 12.5%.

Evolutionary Origin and Human-Specific Expansion of a Cancer/Testis Antigen Gene Family,"['Zhang, Q', 'Su, B']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msu188,SEP 2014,3,"Cancer/testis (CT) antigens are encoded by germline genes and are aberrantly expressed in a number of human cancers. Interestingly, CT antigens are frequently involved in gene families that are highly expressed in germ cells. Here, we presented an evolutionary analysis of the CTAGE (cutaneous T-cell-lymphoma-associated antigen) gene family to delineate its molecular history and functional significance during primate evolution. Comparisons among human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, macaque, marmoset, and other mammals show a rapid and primate specific expansion of CTAGE family, which starts with an ancestral retroposition in the haplorhini ancestor. Subsequent DNA-based duplications lead to the prosperity of single-exon CTAGE copies in catarrhines, especially in humans. Positive selection was identified on the single-exon copies in comparison with functional constraint on the multiexon copies. Further sequence analysis suggests that the newly derived CTAGE genes may obtain regulatory elements from long terminal repeats. Our result indicates the dynamic evolution of primate genomes, and the recent expansion of this CT antigen family in humans may confer advantageous phenotypic traits during early human evolution."
A New Approach for Monitoring Ebolavirus in Wild Great Apes,"['Reed, PE', 'Mulangu, S', 'Cameron, KN', 'Ondzie, AU', 'Joly, D', 'Bermejo, M', 'Rouquet, P', 'Fabozzi, G', 'Bailey, M', 'Shen, ZM', 'Keele, BF', 'Hahn, B', 'Karesh, WB', 'Sullivan, NJ']",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,10.1371/journal.pntd.0003143,SEP 2014,3,"Background: Central Africa is a ""hotspot"" for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of global and local importance, and a current outbreak of ebolavirus is affecting multiple countries simultaneously. Ebolavirus is suspected to have caused recent declines in resident great apes. While ebolavirus vaccines have been proposed as an intervention to protect apes, their effectiveness would be improved if we could diagnostically confirm Ebola virus disease (EVD) as the cause of die-offs, establish ebolavirus geographical distribution, identify immunologically naive populations, and determine whether apes survive virus exposure.

Methodology/Principal findings: Here we report the first successful noninvasive detection of antibodies against Ebola virus (EBOV) from wild ape feces. Using this method, we have been able to identify gorillas with antibodies to EBOV with an overall prevalence rate reaching 10% on average, demonstrating that EBOV exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in this species. Furthermore, evidence of antibodies was identified in gorillas thought previously to be unexposed to EBOV (protected from exposure by rivers as topological barriers of transmission).

Conclusions/Significance: Our new approach will contribute to a strategy to protect apes from future EBOV infections by early detection of increased incidence of exposure, by identifying immunologically naive at-risk populations as potential targets for vaccination, and by providing a means to track vaccine efficacy if such intervention is deemed appropriate. Finally, since human EVD is linked to contact with infected wildlife carcasses, efforts aimed at identifying great ape outbreaks could have a profound impact on public health in local communities, where EBOV causes case-fatality rates of up to 88%."

The arboreal origins of human bipedalism,"['Thorpe, SKS', 'McClymont, JM', 'Crompton, RH']",ANTIQUITY,NA,SEP 2014,3,"Almost a century and a half ago, Charles Darwin in The Descent of Man (1871: 141) highlighted the evolution of bipedalism as one of the key features of the human lineage, freeing the hands for carrying and for using and making tools. But how did it arise? The famous footprints from Laetoli in Tanzania show that hominin ancestors were walking upright by at least 3.65 million years ago. Recent work, however, suggests a much earlier origin for bipedalism, in a Miocene primate ancestor that was still predominantly tree-dwelling. Here Susannah Thorpe, Juliet McClymont and Robin Crompton set out the evidence for that hypothesis and reject the notion that the common ancestor of great apes and humans was a knuckle-walking terrestrial species, as are gorillas and chimpanzees today. The article is followed by a series of comments, rounded off by a reply from the authors."

Landscape features such as rivers may influence genetic population structure, and analysis of structure by sex can further reveal effects of sex-specific dispersal. Using microsatellite genotypes obtained from noninvasively collected fecal samples we investigated the population structure of 261 western lowland gorillas (WLGs) (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from seven locations spanning an approximately 37,000 km(2) region of mainly continuous rain forest within Central African Republic (CAR), Republic of Congo and Cameroon. We found our sample to consist of two or three significantly differentiated clusters. The boundaries of the clusters coincided with courses of major rivers. Moreover, geographic distance detoured around rivers better-explained variation in genetic distance than straight line distance. Together these results suggest that major rivers in our study area play an important role in directing WLG gene flow. The number of clusters did not change when males and females were analyzed separately, indicating a lack of greater philopatry in WLG females than males at this scale.

Personality and Subjective Well-Being in Captive Male Western Lowland Gorillas Living in Bachelor Groups,"['Schaefer, SA', 'Steklis, HD']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22275,SEP 2014,3,"The purpose of this study was to determine the personality structure of eight male gorillas (five silverbacks and three blackbacks) housed at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas and to determine if personality predicts behavior and subjective well-being in male gorillas living in bachelor groups. We used the Hominoid Personality Questionnaire which contains 54 descriptive adjectives with representative items from the human five-factor model. Rates of 12 behaviors that are broadly defined as agonistic or affiliative were independently recorded and calculated. Principal components analysis yielded three reliable personality factors: Dominance, Extraversion/Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. These results are the first potential quantitative evidence for a Conscientiousness factor in a hominoid other than chimpanzees and humans. This suggests that Conscientiousness originated with the common ancestor of male gorillas and humans around 10 million years ago. These results indicate that humans can reliably assess the personality and subjective well-being of captive male gorillas living in bachelor groups with robust levels of inter-rater reliability and validity. Furthermore, personality can accurately predict behavior (r = 0.79; n = 13) and subjective well-being (r = 0.83; n = 5) in gorillas and provide convergent and discriminant validity for the personality factors. The results advocate for the use of personality questionnaires in the captive management of bachelor gorillas over long-term multi-institutional behavioral studies. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Naturalistic Exhibits May be More Effective Than Traditional Exhibits at Improving Zoo-Visitor Attitudes toward African Apes,"['Lukas, KE', 'Ross, SR']",ANTHROZOOS,10.2752/175303714X14023922797904,SEP 2014,0,"Zoos play a unique role in wildlife conservation, particularly in the area of conservation education. Because of their popularity and flagship status for broader conservation issues, great apes may prove to be one of the most important educational conduits in zoos. In 2002, we surveyed knowledge of and attitudes toward African apes in visitors to the Lester E. Fisher Great Ape House (GAH) at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, IL, USA. In the current study, we replicated the survey to document attitudes to and knowledge of the newly renovated and naturalistic Regenstein Center for African Apes (RCAA) and compared results. We found RCAA was no more effective than GAH in increasing visitor knowledge about apes, although visitors answered more questions correctly upon exit than on entrance in both buildings. We did find, however, that RCAA was more effective than GAH at improving visitor attitudes toward chimpanzees. Specifically, upon exiting, RCAA visitors showed increased naturalistic attitudes and reduced utilitarian attitudes toward chimpanzees. Exhibiting apes in naturalistic settings may therefore be an effective way to increase visitor concern for apes in nature and in zoos. Zoos and aquariums investing in new, naturalistic ape exhibits with the aim to educate about, provide emotional connections to, improve attitudes toward, and ultimately increase conservation of apes, need to then critically evaluate whether the actual effect of the designed environment on visitors-above and beyond intended benefits for the animals-is commensurate with the investment. The broader impacts of even small shifts in visitor attitude in the right direction could be significant. These findings may vary across species and settings, however, and should be assessed accordingly."
Dogs learn to solve the support problem based on perceptual cues,"['Muller, CA', 'Riemer, S', 'Viranyi, Z', 'Huber, L', 'Range, F', 'CAUSAL']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-014-0739-y,SEP 2014,3,"Numerous recent studies have investigated how animals solve means-end tasks and unraveled considerable variation in strategies used by different species. Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have typically performed comparably poorly in physical cognition tasks, but a recent study showed that they can solve the on-off condition of the support problem, where they are confronted with two boards, one with a reward placed on it and the other with a reward placed next to it. To explore which strategies dogs use to solve this task, we first tested 37 dogs with the on-off condition tested previously and then tested subjects that passed this condition with three transfer tasks. For the contact condition, the inaccessible reward was touching the second board. For the perceptual containment condition, the inaccessible reward was surrounded on three sides by the second board, but not supported by it, whereas for the gap condition, discontinuous boards were used. Unlike in the previous study, our subjects did not perform above chance level in the initial trials of the on-off condition, but 13 subjects learned to solve it. Their performance in the transfer tasks suggests that dogs can learn to solve the support problem based on perceptual cues, that they can quickly adopt new cues when old ones become unreliable, but also that some apparently inherent preferences are hard to overcome. Our study contributes to accumulating evidence demonstrating that animals typically rely on a variety of perceptual cues to solve physical cognition tasks, without developing an understanding of the underlying causal structure."
Orangutans (Pongo abelii) and a gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) match features in familiar and unfamiliar individuals,"['Vonk, J', 'Hamilton, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-014-0741-4,SEP 2014,1,"Great apes can perceive images as representative of corresponding real-life objects. Coupled with the potential advantages of identifying specific members of one's species and mounting evidence for individual recognition in other non-humans, it seems likely that great apes would have the ability to identify conspecifics in photographs. The ability of four orangutans and a gorilla to match images of individuals of their own and a closely related but unfamiliar species was examined here for the first time. First, the subjects matched photographs of familiar conspecifics taken at various time points in a delayed matching-to-sample procedure (Experiment 1). Second, they matched different photographs of unfamiliar individuals of a different species (Experiment 2) at above chance levels. These results suggest that the subjects matched photographs by matching physical features, not necessarily by recognizing the identity of the individuals depicted. However, they also quickly learned to select photographs of familiar individuals when these photographs were paired with photographs of unfamiliar individuals of their own species (Experiment 3), and three subjects showed transfer to novel images of familiar and unfamiliar individuals. Thus, the findings support the idea that subjects attended to physical features to identify individuals that they could categorize on the basis of familiarity."
A reversed-reward contingency task reveals causal knowledge in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Albiach-Serrano, A', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-014-0749-9,SEP 2014,2,"In the reversed-reward contingency task, subjects are required to choose the less preferred of two options in order to obtain the more preferred one. Usually, this task is used to measure inhibitory skills, but it could also be used to measure how strong the subjects' preferences are. We presented chimpanzees with support tasks where only one of two paper strips could physically bring food into reach. Subjects were rewarded for choosing the non-functional strip. In Experiment 1, subjects failed to pick the non-baited strip. In Experiment 2, subjects failed to pick the broken strip. Chimpanzees performed worse in these tasks than in other similar tasks where instead of paper strips, there were similar shapes painted on a platform. The fact that subjects found the reversed-reward contingency task based on causality more difficult to solve than a perceptually similar task with no causality involved (i.e., arbitrary) suggests that they did not treat real strips as an arbitrary task. Instead, they must have had some causal knowledge of the support problem that made them prefer functional over non-functional strips despite the contrary reward regime."
The Arena System: a novel shared touch-panel apparatus for the study of chimpanzee social interaction and cognition,"['Martin, CF', 'Biro, D', 'Matsuzawa, T']",BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS,10.3758/s13428-013-0418-y,SEP 2014,1,"We report on the development of a novel shared touch-panel apparatus for examining a diverse range of topics in great ape social cognition and interaction. Our apparatus-named the Arena System-is composed of a single multitouch monitor that spans across two separate testing booths, so that individuals situated in each booth have tactile access to half of the monitor and visual access to the whole monitor. Additional components of the system include a smart-film barrier able to restrict visual access between the booths, as well as two automated feeding devices that dispense food rewards to the subjects. The touch-panel, smart-film, and feeders are controlled by a PC that is also responsible for running the experimental tasks. We present data from a pilot behavioral game theory study with two chimpanzees in order to illustrate the efficacy of our method, and we suggest applications for a range of topics including animal social learning, coordination, and behavioral economics. The system enables fully automated experimental procedures, which means that no human participation is needed to run the tasks. The novel use of a touch-panel in a social setting allows for a finer degree of data resolution than do the traditional experimental apparatuses used in prior studies on great ape social interaction."
The Use of a Displacement Device Negatively Affects the Performance of Dogs (Canis familiaris) in Visible Object Displacement Tasks,"['Muller, CA', 'Riemer, S', 'Range, F', 'Huber, L']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0036032,AUG 2014,0,"Visible and invisible displacement tasks have been used widely for comparative studies of animals' understanding of object permanence, with evidence accumulating that some species can solve invisible displacement tasks and, thus, reach Piagetian stage 6 of object permanence. In contrast, dogs appear to rely on associative cues, such as the location of the displacement device, during invisible displacement tasks. It remains unclear, however, whether dogs, and other species that failed in invisible displacement tasks, do so because of their inability to form a mental representation of the target object, or simply because of the involvement of a more salient but potentially misleading associative cue, the displacement device. Here we show that the use of a displacement device impairs the performance of dogs also in visible displacement tasks: their search accuracy was significantly lower when a visible displacement was performed with a displacement device, and only two of initially 42 dogs passed the sham-baiting control conditions. The negative influence of the displacement device in visible displacement tasks may be explained by strong associative cues overriding explicit information about the target object's location, reminiscent of an overshadowing effect, and/or object individuation errors as the target object is placed within the displacement device and moves along a spatiotemporally identical trajectory. Our data suggest that a comprehensive appraisal of a species' performance in object permanence tasks should include visible displacement tasks with the same displacement device used in invisible displacements, which typically has not been done in the past."
Social Environment Elicits Lateralized Behaviors in Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Quaresmini, C', 'Forrester, GS', 'Spiezio, C', 'Vallortigara, G']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0036355,AUG 2014,7,"The influence of the social environment on lateralized behaviors has now been investigated across a wide variety of animal species. New evidence suggests that the social environment can modulate behavior. Currently, there is a paucity of data relating to how primates navigate their environmental space, and investigations that consider the naturalistic context of the individual are few and fragmented. Moreover, there are competing theories about whether only the right or rather both cerebral hemispheres are involved in the processing of social stimuli, especially in emotion processing. Here we provide the first report of lateralized social behaviors elicited by great apes. We employed a continuous focal animal sampling method to record the spontaneous interactions of a captive zoo-living colony of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and a biological family group of peer-reared western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). We specifically focused on which side of the body (i.e., front, rear, left, right) the focal individual preferred to keep conspecifics. Utilizing a newly developed quantitative corpus-coding scheme, analysis revealed both chimpanzees and gorillas demonstrated a significant group-level preference for focal individuals to keep conspecifics positioned to the front of them compared with behind them. More interestingly, both groups also manifested a population-level bias to keep conspecifics on their left side compared with their right side. Our findings suggest a social processing dominance of the right hemisphere for context-specific social environments. Results are discussed in light of the evolutionary adaptive value of social stimulus as a triggering factor for the manifestation of group-level lateralized behaviors."
Genetic comparisons yield insight into the evolution of enamel thickness during human evolution,"['Horvath, JE', 'Ramachandran, GL', 'Fedrigo, O', 'Nielsen, WJ', 'Babbitt, CC', 'St Clair, EM', 'Pfefferle, LW', 'Jernvall, J', 'Wray, GA', 'Wall, CE']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.01.005,AUG 2014,3,"Enamel thickness varies substantially among extant hominoids and is a key trait with significance for interpreting dietary adaptation, life history trajectory, and phylogenetic relationships. There is a strong link in humans between enamel formation and mutations in the exons of the four genes that code for the enamel matrix proteins and the associated protease. The evolution of thick enamel in humans may have included changes in the regulation of these genes during tooth development. The cis-regulatory region in the 5' flank (upstream non-coding region) of MMP20, which codes for enamelysin, the predominant protease active during enamel secretion, has previously been shown to be under strong positive selection in the lineages leading to both humans and chimpanzees. Here we examine evidence for positive selection in the 5' flank and 3' flank of AMELX, AMBN, ENAM, and MMP20. We contrast the human sequence changes with other hominoids (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, gibbons) and rhesus macaques (outgroup), a sample comprising a range of enamel thickness. We find no evidence for positive selection in the protein-coding regions of any of these genes. In contrast, we find strong evidence for positive selection in the 5' flank region of MMP20 and ENAM along the lineage leading to humans, and in both the 5' flank and 3' flank regions of MMP20 along the lineage leading to chimpanzees. We also identify putative transcription factor binding sites overlapping some of the species-specific nucleotide sites and we refine which sections of the up- and downstream putative regulatory regions are most likely to harbor important changes. These non-coding changes and their potential for differential regulation by transcription factors known to regulate tooth development may offer insight into the mechanisms that allow for rapid evolutionary changes in enamel thickness across closely-related species, and contribute to our understanding of the enamel phenotype in hominoids.

Costs of and Investment in Mate-Guarding in Wild Long-Tailed Macaques (Macaca fascicularis): Influences of Female Characteristics and Male-Female Social Bonds,"['Girard-Buttoz, C', 'Heistermann, M', 'Rahmi, E', 'Agil, M', 'Fauzan, PA', 'Engelhardt, A']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-014-9775-3,AUG 2014,1,"Male primates living in multimale groups tend to direct mate and mate-guarding choices toward females of high reproductive value, i.e., high-ranking, parous females, or females with which they share strong bonds. Little is known, however, about the constraints that may limit male mate-guarding choices (the costs of this behavior) and the influence of the females' quality on male investment in mate-guarding. We aimed to study the effects of female rank, parity status, and male-female social bond strength on the costs of and investment in mate-guarding by males. We carried out our study during two reproductive seasons on three groups of wild long-tailed macaques in Indonesia. We combined behavioral observations on male locomotion and activity with noninvasive measurements of fecal glucocorticoids (fGC). Males spent less time feeding when mate-guarding nulliparous females than when mate-guarding parous females and tended to have higher fGC levels when mate-guarding low-ranking nulliparous females than when mate-guarding high-ranking nulliparous ones. Evolution should thus favor male choice for high-ranking parous females because such a decision brings benefits at proximate (reduced costs of mate-guarding) and ultimate (higher reproductive value) levels. Further, male investment in mate-guarding was flexible and contingent on female reproductive and social value. Males were more vigilant and more aggressive toward other males when mate-guarding females to which they were strongly bonded and/or high-ranking ones than when mate-guarding other females. Our findings bring a new dimension to the study of mate choice by showing that males not only mate preferentially with high-quality females but may also aim to secure paternity with these females through optimized monopolization."
Distinguishing ecological constraints from human activity in species range fragmentation: the case of Cross River gorillas,"['Imong, I', 'Robbins, MM', 'Mundry, R', 'Bergl, R', 'Kuhl, HS']",ANIMAL CONSERVATION,10.1111/acv.12100,AUG 2014,2,"The geographic range of many species has been reduced and fragmented by human impact, and ever more species live in human-dominated landscapes where they are confined to small and often suboptimal refuge areas. A detailed understanding of the causation of species' persistence and disappearance is crucial to inform management of which interventions are likely to be most effective. Yet this information is often not available to decision makers and may, in the worst case, lead to erroneous management decisions. To clarify whether Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli (CRG) occurrence is restricted due to ecological constraints or human disturbance, we collected extensive field data on food availability, habitat structure, human activity and wildlife abundance, which we related to CRG occurrence. We also related spatial variation in hunting pressure to human density, household forest use and topography. Our results clearly show that CRG are currently confined to refuge areas because of ongoing detrimental human activities and not because of lack of food resources. Current hunting pressure is driven by human population pressure, accessibility and socioeconomic conditions influencing household dependence on forest. A substantial amount of ecologically suitable but currently unoccupied habitat could potentially carry a much larger CRG population. Conservation management should therefore focus on reducing hunting and disturbance of CRG. In contrast, ecological restoration would not improve CRG living conditions. Our field and analytical approach is widely applicable to the rapidly increasing number of species inhabiting heavily human-influenced landscapes for identifying appropriate management interventions for their protection."
Analysis of Candidate Genes for Lineage-Specific Expression Changes in Humans and Primates,"['Lindskog, C', 'Kuhlwilm, M', 'Davierwala, A', 'Fu, N', 'Hegde, G', 'Uhlen, M', 'Navani, S', 'Paabo, S', 'Ponten, F']",JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH,10.1021/pr500045f,AUG 2014,1,"RUNX2, a gene involved in skeletal development, has previously been shown to be potentially affected by positive selection during recent human evolution. Here we have used antibody-based proteomics to characterize potential differences in expression patterns of RUNX2 interacting partners during primate evolution. Tissue microarrays consisting of a large set of normal tissues from human and macaque were used for protein profiling of 50 RUNX2 partners with immunohistochemistry. Eleven proteins (AR, CREBBP, EP300, FGF2, HDAC3, JUN, PRKD3, RUNX1, SATB2, TCF3, and YAP1) showed differences in expression between humans and macaques. These proteins were further profiled in tissues from chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan, and the corresponding genes were analyzed with regard to genomic features. Moreover, protein expression data were compared with previously obtained RNA sequencing data from six different organs. One gene (TCF3) showed significant expression differences between human and macaque at both the protein and RNA level, with higher expression in a subset of germ cells in human testis compared with macaque. In conclusion, normal tissues from macaque and human showed differences in expression of some RUNX2 partners that could be mapped to various defined cell types. The applied strategy appears advantageous to characterize the consequences of altered genes selected during evolution."
The Interpretive Power of Infraorbital Foramen Area in Making Dietary Inferences in Extant Apes,"['Muchlinski, MN', 'Deane, AS']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.22953,AUG 2014,1,"The infraorbital foramen (IOF) is located below the orbit and transmits the sensory infraorbital nerve (ION) to mechanoreceptors located throughout the maxillary region. The size of the IOF correlates with the size of the ION; thus, the IOF appears to indicate relative touch sensitivity of maxillary region. In primates, IOF size correlates well with diet. Frugivores have relatively larger IOFs than folivores or insectivores because fruit handling/processing requires increased touch sensitivity. However, it is unknown if the IOF can be used to detect subtle dietary differences among closely related hominoid species. Hominoids are traditionally grouped into broad dietary categories, despite the fact that hominoid diets are remarkably diverse. This study examines whether relative IOF size is capable of differentiating among the dietary preferences of closely related species with overlapping, yet divergent diets. We measured IOF area in Hylobates lar, Symphalangus syndactulus, Pongo pygmaeus spp., Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Gorilla beringei graueri, and Gorilla beringei beringei. We classified each species as a dedicated folivore, mixed folivore/frugivore, soft object frugivore, or hard object frugivore. The IOF is documented to be larger in more frugivorous species and smaller in more folivorous taxa. Interestingly, G.b. beringei, had the largest relative IOF of any gorilla, despite being a dedicated folivore. G.b. beringei does have unique food processing behavior that relies heavily on maxillary mechanoreception, thus this finding is not entirely unsupported behaviorally. The results of this study provide evidence that the IOF is an informative feature in interpretations of fossil apes. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Estimation of the ancestral effective population sizes of African great apes under different selection regimes,"['Schrago, CG']",GENETICA,10.1007/s10709-014-9773-6,AUG 2014,0,"Reliable estimates of ancestral effective population sizes are necessary to unveil the population-level phenomena that shaped the phylogeny and molecular evolution of the African great apes. Although several methods have previously been applied to infer ancestral effective population sizes, an analysis of the influence of the selective regime on the estimates of ancestral demography has not been thoroughly conducted. In this study, three independent data sets under different selective regimes were used were composed to tackle this issue. The results showed that selection had a significant impact on the estimates of ancestral effective population sizes of the African great apes. The inference of the ancestral demography of African great apes was affected by the selection regime. The effects, however, were not homogeneous along the ancestral populations of great apes. The effective population size of the ancestor of humans and chimpanzees was more impacted by the selection regime when compared to the same parameter in the ancestor of humans, chimpanzees and gorillas. Because the selection regime influenced the estimates of ancestral effective population size, it is reasonable to assume that a portion of the discrepancy found in previous studies that inferred the ancestral effective population size may be attributable to the differential action of selection on the genes sampled."
Mountain Gorilla Ranging Patterns: Influence of Group Size and Group Dynamics,"['Caillaud, D', 'Ndagijimana, F', 'Giarrusso, AJ', 'Vecellio, V', 'Stoinski, TS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22265,AUG 2014,6,"Since the 1980s, the Virunga mountain gorilla population has almost doubled, now reaching 480 individuals living in a 430-km(2) protected area. Analysis of the gorillas' ranging patterns can provide critical information on the extent and possible effects of competition for food and space. We analyzed 12 years of daily ranging data and inter-group encounter data collected on 11 gorilla groups monitored by the Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda. During that period, the study population increased in size by almost 50% and the number of groups tripled. Groups had small yearly home ranges compared to other known gorilla populations, with an average 90% kernel density estimate of 8.07 km(2) and large between-group variations (3.17-23.59 km(2)). Most groups had consistent home range location over the course of the study but for some, we observed gradual range shifts of up to 4 km. Neighboring groups displayed high home range overlap, which increased dramatically after the formation of new groups. On average, each group used only 28.6% of its 90% kernel home range exclusively, and in some areas up to six different groups had overlapping home ranges with little or no exclusive areas. We found a significant intra-group positive relationship between the number of weaned individuals in a group and the home range size, but the fitted models only explained 17.5% and 13.7% of the variance in 50% and 90% kernel home range size estimates, respectively. This suggests that despite the increase in size, the study population is not yet experiencing marked effects of feeding competition. However, the increase in home range overlap resulting from the formation of new groups led to a sixfold increase in the frequency of inter-group encounters, which exposes the population to elevated risks of fight-related injuries and infanticide.

Analysis of joint force and torque for the human and non-human ape foot during bipedal walking with implications for the evolution of the foot,"['Wang, WJ', 'Abboud, RJ', 'Gunther, MM', 'Crompton, RH', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/joa.12201,AUG 2014,0,"The feet of apes have a different morphology from those of humans. Until now, it has merely been assumed that the morphology seen in humans must be adaptive for habitual bipedal walking, as the habitual use of bipedal walking is generally regarded as one of the most clear-cut differences between humans and apes. This study asks simply whether human skeletal proportions do actually enhance foot performance during human-like bipedalism, by examining the influence of foot proportions on force, torque and work in the foot joints during simulated bipedal walking. Skeletons of the common chimpanzee, orangutan, gorilla and human were represented by multi-rigid-body models, where the components of the foot make external contact via finite element surfaces. The models were driven by identical joint motion functions collected from experiments on human walking. Simulated contact forces between the ground and the foot were found to be reasonably comparable with measurements made during human walking using pressure-and force-platforms. Joint force, torque and work in the foot were then predicted. Within the limitations of our model, the results show that during simulated human-like bipedal walking, (1) the human and non-human ape (NHA) feet carry similar joint forces, although the distributions of the forces differ; (2) the NHA foot incurs larger joint torques than does the human foot, although the human foot has higher values in the first tarso-metatarsal and metatarsophalangeal joints, whereas the NHA foot incurs higher values in the lateral digits; and (3) total work in the metatarso-phalangeal joints is lower in the human foot than in the NHA foot. The results indicate that human foot proportions are indeed well suited to performance in normal human walking."
Evolution of the auditory ossicles in extant hominids: metric variation in African apes and humans,"['Quam, RM', 'Coleman, MN', 'Martinez, I']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/joa.12197,AUG 2014,3,"The auditory ossicles in primates have proven to be a reliable source of phylogenetic information. Nevertheless, to date, very little data have been published on the metric dimensions of the ear ossicles in African apes and humans. The present study relies on the largest samples of African ape ear ossicles studied to date to address questions of taxonomic differences and the evolutionary transformation of the ossicles in gorillas, chimpanzees and humans. Both African ape taxa show a malleus that is characterized by a long and slender manubrium and relatively short corpus, whereas humans show the opposite constellation of a short and thick manubrium and relatively long corpus. These changes in the manubrium are plausibly linked with changes in the size of the tympanic membrane. The main difference between the incus in African apes and humans seems to be related to changes in the functional length. Compared with chimpanzees, human incudes are larger in nearly all dimensions, except articular facet height, and show a more open angle between the axes. The gorilla incus resembles humans more closely in its metric dimensions, including functional length, perhaps as a result of the dramatically larger body size compared with chimpanzees. The differences between the stapedes of humans and African apes are primarily size-related, with humans being larger in nearly all dimensions. Nevertheless, some distinctions between the African apes were found in the obturator foramen and head height. Although correlations between metric variables in different ossicles were generally lower than those between variables in the same bone, variables of the malleus/incus complex appear to be more strongly correlated than those of the incus/stapes complex, perhaps reflecting the different embryological and evolutionary origins of the ossicles. The middle ear lever ratio for the African apes is similar to other haplorhines, but humans show the lowest lever ratio within primates. Very low levels of sexual dimorphism were found in the ossicles within each taxon, but some relationship with body size and several dimensions of the ear bones was found. Several of the metric distinctions in the incus and stapes imply a slightly different articulation of the ossicular chain within the tympanic cavity in African apes compared with humans. The limited auditory implications of these metric differences in the ossicles are also discussed. Finally, the results of this study suggest that several plesiomorphic features for apes may be retained in the ear bones of the early hominin taxa Australopithecus and Paranthropus as well as in the Neandertals."

First detection of Echinococcus multilocularis infection in two species of nonhuman primates raised in a zoo: A fatal case in Cercopithecus diana and a strongly suspected case of spontaneous recovery in Macaca nigra,"['Yamano, K', 'Kouguchi, H', 'Uraguchi, K', 'Mukai, T', 'Shibata, C', 'Yamamoto, H', 'Takaesu, N', 'Ito, M', 'Makino, Y', 'Takiguchi, M', 'Yagi, K']",PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL,10.1016/j.parint.2014.04.006,AUG 2014,0,"The causative parasite of alveolar echinococcosis, Echinococcus multilocularis, maintains its life cycle between red foxes (Vulpes vulples, the definitive hosts) and voles (the intermediate hosts) in Hokkaido, Japan. Primates, including humans, and some other mammal species can be infected by the accidental ingestion of eggs in the feces of red foxes. In August 2011, a 6-year-old zoo-raised female Diana monkey (Cercopithecus diana) died from alveolar echinococcosis. E. multilocularis infection was confirmed by histopathological examination and detection of the E. multilocularis DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A field survey in the zoo showed that fox intrusion was common, and serodiagnosis of various nonhuman primates using western blotting detected a case of a 14-year-old female Celebes crested macaque (Macaca nigra) that was weakly positive for E. multilocularis. Computed tomography revealed only one small calcified lesion (approximately 8 mm) in the macaque's liver, and both western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed a gradual decline of antibody titer. These findings strongly suggest that the animal had recovered spontaneously. Until this study, spontaneous recovery from E. multilocularis infection in a nonhuman primate had never been reported.

Niche Partitioning in Sympatric Gorilla and Pan from Cameroon: Implications for Life History Strategies and for Reconstructing the Evolution of Hominin Life History,"['Macho, GA', 'Lee-Thorp, JA']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0102794,JUL 23 2014,2,"Factors influencing the hominoid life histories are poorly understood, and little is known about how ecological conditions modulate the pace of their development. Yet our limited understanding of these interactions underpins life history interpretations in extinct hominins. Here we determined the synchronisation of dental mineralization/eruption with brain size in a 20th century museum collection of sympatric Gorilla gorilla and Pan troglodytes from Central Cameroon. Using delta C-13 and delta N-15 of individuals' hair, we assessed whether and how differences in diet and habitat use may have impacted on ape development. The results show that, overall, gorilla hair delta C-13 and delta N-15 values are more variable than those of chimpanzees, and that gorillas are consistently lower in delta C-13 and delta N-15 compared to chimpanzees. Within a restricted, isotopically-constrained area, gorilla brain development appears delayed relative to dental mineralization/eruption [or dental development is accelerated relative to brains]: only about 87.8% of adult brain size is attained by the time first permanent molars come into occlusion, whereas it is 92.3% in chimpanzees. Even when M1s are already in full functional occlusion, gorilla brains lag behind those of chimpanzee (91% versus 96.4%), relative to tooth development. Both bootstrap analyses and stable isotope results confirm that these results are unlikely due to sampling error. Rather, delta N-15 values imply that gorillas are not fully weaned (physiologically mature) until well after M1 are in full functional occlusion. In chimpanzees the transition from infant to adult feeding appears (a) more gradual and (b) earlier relative to somatic development. Taken together, the findings are consistent with life history theory that predicts delayed development when non-density dependent mortality is low, i.e. in closed habitats, and with the ""risk aversion'' hypothesis for frugivorous species as a means to avert starvation. Furthermore, the results highlight the complexity and plasticity of hominoid/hominin development."
Will Oil Palm's Homecoming Spell Doom for Africa's Great Apes?,"['Wich, SA', 'Garcia-Ulloa, J', 'Kuhl, HS', 'Humle, T', 'Lee, JSH', 'Koh, LP']",CURRENT BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cub.2014.05.077,JUL 21 2014,5,"Expansion of oil palm plantations has led to extensive wildlife habitat conversion in Southeast Asia [1]. This expansion is driven by a global demand for palm oil for products ranging from foods to detergents [2], and more recently for biofuels [3]. The negative impacts of oil palm development on biodiversity [1, 4, 5], and on orangutans (Pongo spp.) in particular, have been well documented [6, 7] and publicized [8, 9]. Although the oil palm is of African origin, Africa's production historically lags behind that of Southeast Asia. Recently, significant investments have been made that will likely drive the expansion of Africa's oil palm industry [10]. There is concern that this will lead to biodiversity losses similar to those in Southeast Asia. Here, we analyze the potential impact of oil palm development on Africa's great apes. Current great ape distribution in Africa substantially overlaps with current oil palm concessions (by 58.7%) and areas suitable for oil palm production (by 42.3%). More importantly, 39.9% of the distribution of great ape species on unprotected lands overlaps with suitable oil palm areas. There is an urgent need to develop guidelines for the expansion of oil palm in Africa to minimize the negative effects on apes and other wildlife. There is also a need for research to support land use decisions to reconcile economic development, great ape conservation, and avoiding carbon emissions."
Grandmothering drives the evolution of longevity in a probabilistic model,"['Kim, PS', 'McQueen, JS', 'Coxworth, JE', 'Hawkes, K', 'MENOPAUSE']",JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.03.011,JUL 21 2014,6,"We present a mathematical model based on the Grandmother Hypothesis to simulate how human postmenopausal longevity could have evolved as ancestral grandmothers began to assist the reproductive success of younger females by provisioning grandchildren. Grandmothers' help would allow mothers to give birth to subsequent offspring sooner without risking the survival of existing offspring. Our model is an agent-based model (ABM), in which the population evolves according to probabilistic rules governing interactions among individuals. The model is formulated according to the Gillespie algorithm of determining the times to next events. Grandmother effects drive the population from an equilibrium representing a great-ape-like average adult lifespan in the lower twenties to a new equilibrium with a human-like average adult lifespan in the lower forties.

The stochasticity of the ABM allows the possible coexistence of two locally-stable equilibria, corresponding to great-ape-like and human-like lifespans. Populations with grandmothering that escape the ancestral condition then shift to human-like lifespan, but the transition takes longer than previous models (Kim et al., 2012). Our simulations are consistent with the possibility that distinctive longevity is a feature of genus Homo that long antedated the appearance of our species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Suitable Habitats for Endangered Frugivorous Mammals: Small-Scale Comparison, Regeneration Forest and Chimpanzee Density in Kibale National Park, Uganda","['Bortolamiol, S', 'Cohen, M', 'Potts, K', 'Pennec, F', 'Rwaburindore, P', 'Kasenene, J', 'Seguya, A', 'Vignaud, Q', 'Krief, S']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0102177,JUL 17 2014,3,"Landscape patterns and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) densities in Kibale National Park show important variation among communities that are geographically close to one another (from 1.5 to 5.1 chimpanzees/km(2)). Anthropogenic activities inside the park (past logging activities, current encroachment) and outside its limits (food and cash crops) may impact the amount and distribution of food resources for chimpanzees (frugivorous species) and their spatial distribution within the park. Spatial and temporal patterns of fruit availability were recorded over 18 months at Sebitoli (a site of intermediate chimpanzee density and higher anthropic pressure) with the aim of understanding the factors explaining chimpanzee density there, in comparison to results from two other sites, also in Kibale: Kanyawara (low chimpanzee density) and Ngogo (high density, and furthest from Sebitoli). Because of the post-logging regenerating status of the forest in Sebitoli and Kanyawara, smaller basal area (BA) of fruiting trees most widely consumed by the chimpanzees in Kanyawara and Sebitoli was expected compared to Ngogo (not logged commercially). Due to the distance between sites, spatial and temporal fruit abundance in Sebitoli was expected to be more similar to Kanyawara than to Ngogo. While species functional classes consumed by Sebitoli chimpanzees (foods eaten during periods of high or low fruit abundance) differ from the two other sites, Sebitoli is very similar to Kanyawara in terms of land-cover and consumed species. Among feeding trees, Ficus species are particularly important resources for chimpanzees at Sebitoli, where their basal area is higher than at Kanywara or Ngogo. Ficus species provided a relatively consistent supply of food for chimpanzees throughout the year, and we suggest that this could help to explain the unusually high density of chimpanzees in such a disturbed site."
Individual Distinctiveness in Call Types of Wild Western Female Gorillas,"['Salmi, R', 'Hammerschmidt, K', 'Doran-Sheehy, DM']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0101940,JUL 16 2014,1,"Individually distinct vocalizations play an important role in animal communication, allowing call recipients to respond differentially based on caller identity. However, which of the many calls in a species' repertoire should have more acoustic variability and be more recognizable is less apparent. One proposed hypothesis is that calls used over long distances should be more distinct because visual cues are not available to identify the caller. An alternative hypothesis proposes that close calls should be more recognizable because of their importance in social interactions. To examine which hypothesis garners more support, the acoustic variation and individual distinctiveness of eight call types of six wild western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) females were investigated. Acoustic recordings of gorilla calls were collected at the Mondika Research Center (Republic of Congo). Acoustic variability was high in all gorilla calls. Similar high inter-individual variation and potential for identity coding (PIC) was found for all call types. Discriminant function analyses confirmed that all call types were individually distinct (although for call types with lowest sample size - hum, grumble and scream - this result cannot be generalized), suggesting that neither the distance at which communication occurs nor the call social function alone can explain the evolution of identity signaling in western gorilla communication."

Unfortunately, resistant bacteria are spreading to all ecosystems, including the strictly protected ones. We investigated antimicrobial resistance in gastrointestinal Enterobacteriaceae of wild mammals and people living within Dzangha-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic, with an emphasis on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. We compare resistance genes found in microbiota of humans, gorillas habituated and unhabituated to humans and other wildlife. In gorillas, we additionally investigate the presence of ESBL resistant isolates after treatment by ceftiofur. We found a considerable prevalence of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates with ESBL and PMQR genes in humans (10% and 31%, respectively). Among wildlife the most significant findings were CTX-M-15-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in a habituated gorilla and a multiresistant Escherichia coli isolate with gene qepA in an unhabituated gorilla. Other isolates from wildlife were mostly represented by qnrB-harboring Citrobacter spp. The relatedness of resistant E. coli was investigated in a PFGE-based dendrogram; isolates from gorillas showed less than 80% similarity to each other and less than 80% similarity to human isolates. No ESBL-producing isolates were found in animals treated by ceftiofur. Although we did not detect any bacterial clone common to wildlife and humans, we detected an intersection in the spectrum of resistance genes found in humans and gorillas, represented by bla(CTX-M-15) and qepA.

Wild Western Lowland Gorillas Signal Selectively Using Odor,"['Klailova, M', 'Lee, PC']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0099554,JUL 9 2014,4,"Mammals communicate socially through visual, auditory and chemical signals. The chemical sense is the oldest sense and is shared by all organisms including bacteria. Despite mounting evidence for social chemo-signaling in humans, the extent to which it modulates behavior is debated and can benefit from comparative models of closely related hominoids. The use of odor cues in wild ape social communication has been only rarely explored. Apart from one study on wild chimpanzee sniffing, our understanding is limited to anecdotes. We present the first study of wild gorilla chemo-communication and the first analysis of olfactory signaling in relation to arousal levels and odor strength in wild apes. If gorilla scent is used as a signaling mechanism instead of only a sign of arousal or stress, odor emission should be context specific and capable of variation as a function of the relationships between the emitter and perceiver(s). Measured through a human pungency scale, we determined the factors that predicted extreme levels of silverback odor for one wild western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) group silverback. Extreme silverback odor was predicted by the presence and intensity of inter-unit interactions, silverback anger, distress and long-calling auditory rates, and the absence of close proximity between the silverback and mother of the youngest infant. Odor strength also varied according to the focal silverback's strategic responses during high intensity inter-unit interactions. Silverbacks appear to use odor as a modifiable form of communication; where odor acts as a highly flexible, context dependent signaling mechanism to group members and extragroup units. The importance of olfaction to ape social communication may be especially pertinent in Central African forests where limited visibility may necessitate increased reliance on other senses."
Fine-scale genetic structure analyses suggest further male than female dispersal in mountain gorillas,"['Roy, J', 'Gray, M', 'Stoinski, T', 'Robbins, MM', 'Vigilant, L', 'SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION ANALYSIS']",BMC ECOLOGY,10.1186/1472-6785-14-21,JUL 7 2014,1,"Background: Molecular studies in social mammals rarely compare the inferences gained from genetic analyses with field information, especially in the context of dispersal. In this study, we used genetic data to elucidate sex-specific dispersal dynamics in the Virunga Massif mountain gorilla population (Gorilla beringei beringei), a primate species characterized by routine male and female dispersal from stable mixed-sex social groups. Specifically, we conducted spatial genetic structure analyses for each sex and linked our genetically-based observations with some key demographic and behavioural data from this population.

Results: To investigate the spatial genetic structure of mountain gorillas, we analysed the genotypes of 193 mature individuals at 11 microsatellite loci by means of isolation-by-distance and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Although not all males and females disperse, female gorillas displayed an isolation-by-distance pattern among groups and a signal of dispersal at short distances from their natal group based on spatial autocorrelation analyses. In contrast, male genotypes were not correlated with spatial distance, thus suggesting a larger mean dispersal distance for males as compared to females. Both within sex and mixed-sex pairs were on average genetically more related within groups than among groups.

Conclusions: Our study provides evidence for an intersexual difference in dispersal distance in the mountain gorilla. Overall, it stresses the importance of investigating spatial genetic structure patterns on a sex-specific basis to better understand the dispersal dynamics of the species under investigation. It is currently poorly understood why some male and female gorillas disperse while others remain in the natal group. Our results on average relatedness within and across groups confirm that groups often contain close relatives. While inbreeding avoidance may play a role in driving female dispersal, we note that more detailed dyadic genetic analyses are needed to shed light on the role of inbreeding avoidance as an ultimate cause of female dispersal in mountain gorillas."
"Food dropping as a food transfer mechanism among western lowland gorillas in Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon","['Iwata, Y']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-014-0417-3,JUL 2014,0,"In this paper, I describe the food-dropping behavior of western lowland gorillas observed in Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon. I collected observational data of gorillas eating in trees, and recorded whether any individuals were positioned under the same tree. In 22 of the 24 cases of individuals being present under a tree, I observed the gorilla in a tree dropping food to the individual below. In most cases, the recipient was a silverback or an elder half-sibling of the dropper. The dropper's elder full-sibling was never a recipient. The food-dropping behavior of Moukalaba western lowland gorillas is likely due to a combination of factors: their frugivory, arboreality, large body size, and the scarcity of terrestrial herbs. It is difficult for multiple gorillas to simultaneously feed in the same tree. Under such limitations, younger gorillas face difficulties in defending their feeding patches from older individuals. Nearly 90 % of the recipients were older than the food droppers. Furthermore, food droppers were significantly younger than non-food droppers who simultaneously fed on the same tree, and most-food recipients were significantly older than least-food recipients on the ground. Food dropping may, therefore, be a tactic employed by younger gorillas to defend a feeding site from older individuals. This study suggests that food dropping may reduce feeding contest competition in a gorilla group in Moukalaba. This is a preliminary study that indicates that food dropping may be intentionally used as a way to reduce feeding competition; nevertheless, further studies are needed."
Concealing of facial expressions by a wild Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus),"['Thunstrom, M', 'Kuchenbuch, P', 'Young, C']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-014-0423-5,JUL 2014,0,"Behavioural research on non-vocal communication among non-human primates and its possible links to the origin of human language is a long-standing research topic. Because human language is under voluntary control, it is of interest whether this is also true for any communicative signals of other species. It has been argued that the behaviour of hiding a facial expression with one's hand supports the idea that gestures might be under more voluntary control than facial expressions among non-human primates, and it has also been interpreted as a sign of intentionality. So far, the behaviour has only been reported twice, for single gorilla and chimpanzee individuals, both in captivity. Here, we report the first observation of concealing of facial expressions by a monkey, a Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus), living in the wild. On eight separate occasions between 2009 and 2011 an adult male was filmed concealing two different facial expressions associated with play and aggression (""play face"" and ""scream face""), 22 times in total. The videos were analysed in detail, including gaze direction, hand usage, duration, and individuals present. This male was the only individual in his group to manifest this behaviour, which always occurred in the presence of a dominant male. Several possible interpretations of the function of the behaviour are discussed. The observations in this study indicate that the gestural communication and cognitive abilities of monkeys warrant more research attention."
Calculated reciprocity? A comparative test with six primate species,"['Amici, F', 'Aureli, F', 'Mundry, R', 'Amaro, AS', 'Barroso, AM', 'Ferretti, J', 'Call, J']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-014-0424-4,JUL 2014,2,"Little evidence of calculated reciprocity has been found in non-human primates so far. In this study, we used a simple experimental set-up to test whether partners pulled a sliding table to altruistically provide food to each other in short-term interactions. We tested 46 dyads of chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, brown capuchin monkeys and spider monkeys to examine whether a subject's tendency to provide food to a partner was directly affected by the partner's previous behaviour, by the species, by the condition (i.e., whether the partner could access the food provided by the subject) and by the social tolerance levels within each dyad. Chimpanzees and orangutans were the only species pulling significantly more when the partner could retrieve the food altruistically provided. However, no species reciprocated food exchanges, as subjects' probability to pull was not affected by the previous number of the partner's pulls, with the possible exception of one orangutan dyad. Although subjects clearly knew how the apparatus worked and easily obtained food for themselves, individuals did not usually take the opportunity to provide food to their partners, suggesting that calculated reciprocity is not a common behaviour and that food exchanges are usually not reciprocated in the short-term within dyads."
The global diversity of eating patterns: Human nutritional health in comparative perspective,"['Leonard, WR']",PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR,10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.02.050,JUL 2014,4,"This paper draws on comparative data to explore the evolutionary origins of human nutritional needs and the diverse strategies used by human populations to meet those needs. Humans have evolved distinctive nutritional characteristics associated with the high metabolic costs of our large brains. The evolution of larger hominid brain size necessitated the development of foraging strategies that both provided high quality foods, and required larger ranges and higher levels of energy expenditure. Over time, human subsistence strategies have become ever more efficient in obtaining energy with minimal time and effort. Compared to data from traditional, subsistence-level societies, the US diet differs markedly in its fat and carbohydrate composition, but not in its absolute energy content. Energy expenditure levels of subsistence populations are significantly higher than those of the US and other industrialized societies. These data suggest that rising rates of obesity associated with lifestyle 'modernization' is not simply the product of greater energy intakes, but rather shifts energy balance and diet composition.

Characterization of Enteroviruses from Non-Human Primates in Cameroon Revealed Virus Types Widespread in Humans along with Candidate New Types and Species,"['Sadeuh-Mba, SA', 'Bessaud, M', 'Joffret, ML', 'Zanga, MCE', 'Balanant, J', 'Ngole, EM', 'Njouom, R', 'Reynes, JM', 'Delpeyroux, F', 'Rousset, D']",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,10.1371/journal.pntd.0003052,JUL 2014,3,"Enteroviruses (EVs) infecting African Non-Human Primates (NHP) are still poorly documented. This study was designed to characterize the genetic diversity of EVs among captive and wild NHP in Cameroon and to compare this diversity with that found in humans. Stool specimens were collected in April 2008 in NHP housed in sanctuaries in Yaounde and neighborhoods. Moreover, stool specimens collected from wild NHP from June 2006 to October 2008 in the southern rain forest of Cameroon were considered. RNAs purified directly from stool samples were screened for EVs using a sensitive RT-nested PCR targeting the VP1 capsid coding gene whose nucleotide sequence was used for molecular typing. Captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) were primarily infected by EV types already reported in humans in Cameroon and elsewhere: Coxsackievirus A13 and A24, Echovirus 15 and 29, and EV-B82. Moreover EV-A119, a novel virus type recently described in humans in central and west Africa, was also found in a captive Chimpanzee. EV-A76, which is a widespread virus in humans, was identified in wild chimpanzees, thus suggesting its adaptation and parallel circulation in human and NHP populations in Cameroon. Interestingly, some EVs harbored by wild NHP were genetically distinct from all existing types and were thus assigned as new types. One chimpanzee-derived virus was tentatively assigned as EV-J121 in the EV-J species. In addition, two EVs from wild monkeys provisionally registered as EV-122 and EV-123 were found to belong to a candidate new species. Overall, this study indicates that the genetic diversity of EVs among NHP is more important than previously known and could be the source of future new emerging human viral diseases."

Changes were consistent with left-dominant and biventricular sub-types, which are both phenotypic variants found within human families with familial arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Previously reported fibrosing cardiomyopathies in chimpanzees were characterized by nonspecific interstitial fibrosis, in contrast to the replacement fibrofatty infiltration with predilection for the outer myocardium seen in these 2 cases.

"Familiarity is more important than phenotypic similarity in shaping social relationships in a facultative female dispersed primate, Colobus vellerosus","['Wikberg, EC', 'Ting, N', 'Sicotte, P']",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,10.1016/j.beproc.2014.04.002,JUL 2014,5,"Animals often bias affiliative behaviors toward kin, but it is unclear what mechanism most species use to discriminate kin. We investigated if facultative dispersed female primates use phenotype matching and/or familiarity to discriminate female kin. We studied 38 adult female Colobus vellerosus at Boabeng-Fiema, Ghana. We determined dyadic co-residency status and age proximity using long-term demographic data, R-values from 17 short tandem repeat loci, and interaction rates using focal samples collected during one year. Approach rates were not strongly affected by how long females had resided together, which contrasts to the familiarity hypothesis. Females approached and groomed maternal kin more than other females, which supports the mother-mediated familiarity hypothesis. Females did not discriminate paternal half siblings from non-kin, and they did not prefer to interact with females of similar age. Short-term co-resident kin did not bias affiliation toward each other, indicating that female colobus cannot consistently recognize less familiar kin via phenotype matching or that biasing behaviors toward less familiar kin is not beneficial. Despite showing facultative dispersal that may reduce the accuracy of using familiarity as a kin recognition mechanism, female choice of social partners was based on familiarity, which conforms to the pattern observed in many female philopatric primates.

These high levels of parasite infections could represent an additional burden in a population where there is a high rate of the SIV virus in circulation."

It causes severe meningoencephalitis in infected humans (PAM, primary amebic meningoencephalitis). The mortality rate of this disease reaches over 99%. Most of the cases have been reported in the United States and have occurred mostly in summer. The prevalence of the disease in animals has been significantly lower than in man so far. Cases have been reported in cows, sheep, gibbons, gorillas, and tapirs, and experimental infections have been induced in mice. Meningoencephalitis is accompanied by progressive neurological signs. In the necropsy, the thickening of the meninges and multifocal areas of cerebral and cerebellar malacia are diagnosed. Histologically, a multifocal, necrosuppurative meningoencephalitis with areas of mallacia containing ameba trophoziotes are visible. The diagnosis of the disease is difficult. Ameba may be detected in the cerebro-spinal fluid, but often only after a culture of necropsy samples has been performed. The following techniques are used to diagnose the disease: immunofluorescent staining, light and confocal microscopy, ELISA, PCR, and RQ-PCR."
A multi-enclosure study investigating the behavioural response of meerkats to zoo visitors,"['Sherwen, SL', 'Magrath, MJL', 'Butler, KL', 'Phillips, CJC', 'Hemsworth, PH']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2014.04.012,JUL 2014,2,"The scientific literature indicates that visitors may affect both the behaviour and welfare of zoo animals. Captive born slender-tailed meerkats, Suricata suricatta, at three exhibits were studied under two treatments (1) unregulated visitor behaviour and (2) regulated visitor behaviour, where signage was positioned requesting visitors to be quiet and not to interact with the animals. At each exhibit, treatments were imposed using a four-replicate paired comparison design, with each pair consisting of 2 consecutive days of different treatments. Meerkat behaviour and location were recorded using instantaneous sampling every 2 min over a total of 72 h across exhibits. The efficacy of the regulated treatment in moderating visitor behaviour was evaluated by recording visitor noise using a decibel logger and by assessing the intensity of visitor behaviour (scale of 0-2 from passively observing to actively attempting to gain the animals' attention) every 2 min during each observation period. The regulated treatment was successful in reducing visitor noise at each exhibit by around 32% (from 55 to 51 dBA, P = 0.0001). Furthermore, while there was a significant interaction of exhibit with treatment (P = 0.013), the regulated treatment reduced the score of intensity of visitor behaviour at each exhibit. However, despite good experimental precision, the regulated treatment did not change the distance meerkats positioned themselves from visitors (regulated 2.9 m and unregulated 3.1 m, P = 0.2) or the proportion of time they engaged in vigilant behaviour (regulated 0.34 and unregulated 0.32, P = 0.6) or the proportion of time spent looking towards visitors (regulated 0.42 and unregulated 0.46, P = 0.4), indicating that the meerkats at the three study exhibits were behaviourally unresponsive to variation in the intensity of visitor behaviour.

The Choice to Access Outdoor Areas Affects the Behavior of Great Apes,"['Kurtycz, LM', 'Wagner, KE', 'Ross, SR']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,10.1080/10888705.2014.896213,JUL-SEP 2014,1,"Outdoor access is often cited as a critical component of appropriate housing for great apes in captivity, and although studies have shown that offering primates choices can improve welfare, choice to access specific areas has been empirically neglected. Behavioral data were collected on chimpanzees and gorillas housed in naturalistic enclosures while (a) restricted to an indoor enclosure and (b) permitted free access to an adjacent outdoor area. To isolate the factor of choice, only the sessions in which apes remained indoors were compared. With choice, chimpanzees showed more frequent social, F(1, 5) = 20.526, p = .006, and self-directed behaviors, F(1, 5) = 13.507, p = .014, and lower inactivity levels, F(1, 5) = 9.239, p = .029. Gorillas were more frequently inactive, F(1, 8) = 22.259, p = .002, and produced lower levels of object manipulation, F(1, 8) = 8.243, p = .021, and feeding, F(1, 8) = 5.407, p = .049. Results are consistent with an association between choice and the expression of species-typical and arousal behaviors in chimpanzees. The effects are less evident in gorillas, but this outcome may be buffered by the species' lower motivation to utilize the outdoor spaces. Findings highlight species-specific reactions to access to choice that may offer insight for enclosure design, management, and nonhuman animal welfare."
The Ontogeny of Talo-Crural Appositional Articular Morphology Among Catarrhine Taxa: Adult Shape Reflects Substrate Use,"['Turley, K', 'Frost, SR']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22528,JUL 2014,0,"The upper ankle joint forms a single articular plane between organism and the foot and substrate. Singular warp analysis shows that its shape reflects substrate use. This study explores whether the differences in shape are genetic with a developmental trajectory evident during ontogeny or epigenetic and the result of substrate use by the individual. A total of 418 matched distal tibial and proximal talar landmarked surfaces from adult and subadult specimens from 12 diverse catarrhine taxa were studied. Specimens were grouped by molar eruption (M1, M2, and M3) for comparative analysis. Generalized Procrustes analysis, multivariate regression, relative warp analysis, singular warp analysis, and permutation tests were used. Singular warp analysis for the entire cohort was highly significant in the first singular warp, with the adult taxa sorting by substrate use. All 173 subadults clustered with an adult ""arboreal"" shape profile. Among Hominoidea, adults (M3) sorted by substrate use with Pan paniscus and Hylobatidae assuming an ""arboreal"" shape separate from Pan troglodytes and the remaining taxa with ""terrestrial"" shape. Cercopithecoid adults sorted by substrate use as well, with the M3 specimens of Papio hamadryas and Macaca thibetana demonstrating a ""terrestrial"" shape. Differences in mode of locomotion did not affect the findings in the first singular warp. Results confirmed the convergence of talo-crural shape among superfamilies based on substrate use and divergence in shape within Pan and Macaca, based on substrate use. The shape differences among adults (M3) are consistent with a plastic response to the behavioral stimulus of substrate use. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Compressive stress profiles of chemically strengthened glass after exposure to high voltage electric fields,"['Thirion, LM', 'Streltsova, E', 'Lee, WY', 'Bao, ZN', 'He, MQ', 'Mauro, JC']",JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS,10.1016/j.jnonaysol.2014.04.003,JUL 1 2014,1,"The ion exchange process for chemical strengthening of glass involves an inter-diffusion of alkali ions between the glass and a molten salt bath. In most commercial glasses, this comprises an exchange of Na+ ions in the glass for larger K+ ions from the salt bath. The stuffing of K+ ions into sites previously occupied by Na+ in the glass results in the formation of a compressive stress profile in the glass. In the absence of stress relaxation, this compressive stress profile largely follows the concentration profile of the K+ ions. Any subsequent migration of K+ ions within the glass would result in a change in this stress profile, which could lead to different mechanical behaviors of the glass. In particular, a reduction of the surface compressive stress could lead to a compromise in the retained strength of the glass, making it more susceptible to failure. Recent work has shown that chemically strengthened glass can be used as an effective substrate material for organic thin film transistors (TFTs), since the temperatures involved with organic TFT deposition are low enough to avoid any compromise in the compressive stress profile. This opens the possibility of fabricating high strength organic TFT displays. However, the question remains as to whether the exposure of the glass to an electric field may lead to the diffusion of the alkali ions and a corresponding alteration of the stress profile, which could compromise the strength of the organic TFT device. In this paper, we demonstrate that there is no change in the stress profile of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 after subjecting the glass to much higher voltage dc fields compared to the maximum field that would be exhibited in an organic TFT device. The stress profile is modified only after treating the glass at sufficiently high temperature, where alkali migration becomes thermally activated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) map number onto space,"['Drucker, CB', 'Brannon, EM']",COGNITION,10.1016/j.cognition.2014.03.011,JUL 2014,10,"Humans map number onto space. However, the origins of this association, and particularly the degree to which it depends upon cultural experience, are not fully understood. Here we provide the first demonstration of a number-space mapping in a non-human primate. We trained four adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to select the fourth position from the bottom of a five-element vertical array. Monkeys maintained a preference to choose the fourth position through changes in the appearance, location, and spacing of the vertical array. We next asked whether monkeys show a spatially-oriented number mapping by testing their responses to the same five-element stimulus array rotated ninety degrees into a horizontal line. In these horizontal probe trials, monkeys preferentially selected the fourth position from the left, but not the fourth position from the right. Our results indicate that rhesus macaques map number onto space, suggesting that the association between number and space in human cognition is not purely a result of cultural experience and instead has deep evolutionary roots.

A universal genomic coordinate translator for comparative genomics,"['Zamani, N', 'Sundstroom, G', 'Meadows, JRS', 'Hooppner, MP', 'Dainat, J', 'Lantz, H', 'Haas, BJ', 'Grabherr, MG']",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,10.1186/1471-2105-15-227,JUN 30 2014,1,"Background: Genomic duplications constitute major events in the evolution of species, allowing paralogous copies of genes to take on fine-tuned biological roles. Unambiguously identifying the orthology relationship between copies across multiple genomes can be resolved by synteny, i.e. the conserved order of genomic sequences. However, a comprehensive analysis of duplication events and their contributions to evolution would require all-to-all genome alignments, which increases at N-2 with the number of available genomes, N.

Results: Here, we introduce Kraken, software that omits the all-to-all requirement by recursively traversing a graph of pairwise alignments and dynamically re-computing orthology. Kraken scales linearly with the number of targeted genomes, N, which allows for including large numbers of genomes in analyses. We first evaluated the method on the set of 12 Drosophila genomes, finding that orthologous correspondence computed indirectly through a graph of multiple synteny maps comes at minimal cost in terms of sensitivity, but reduces overall computational runtime by an order of magnitude. We then used the method on three well-annotated mammalian genomes, human, mouse, and rat, and show that up to 93% of protein coding transcripts have unambiguous pairwise orthologous relationships across the genomes. On a nucleotide level, 70 to 83% of exons match exactly at both splice junctions, and up to 97% on at least one junction. We last applied Kraken to an RNA-sequencing dataset from multiple vertebrates and diverse tissues, where we confirmed that brain-specific gene family members, i.e. one-to-many or many-to-many homologs, are more highly correlated across species than single-copy (i.e. one-to-one homologous) genes. Not limited to protein coding genes, Kraken also identifies thousands of newly identified transcribed loci, likely non-coding RNAs that are consistently transcribed in human, chimpanzee and gorilla, and maintain significant correlation of expression levels across species.

Conclusions: Kraken is a computational genome coordinate translator that facilitates cross-species comparisons, distinguishes orthologs from paralogs, and does not require costly all-to-all whole genome mappings. Kraken is freely available under LPGL from http://github.com/nedaz/kraken."
Making smart phones smarter with photonics,"['Lapointe, J', 'Gagne, M', 'Li, MJ', 'Kashyap, R']",OPTICS EXPRESS,10.1364/OE.22.015473,JUN 30 2014,5,"Smart phones and tablets have become ubiquitous. Corning (R) Gorilla (R) Glass is well-known to provide durability and scratch-resistance to many smart phones and other mobile devices. Using femtosecond lasers, we report high quality photonic devices, such as a temperature sensor and an authentication security system, we believe for the first time. It was found that this kind of glass is an exceptional host for three dimensional waveguides. High quality multimode waveguides are demonstrated with the lowest measured loss value (0.027 dB/cm loss) to our knowledge in any glass using fs laser inscription. High quality (0.053 dB/cm loss) single-mode waveguides have been also fabricated using a fs laser scan speed of 300 mm/s, the fastest fabrication speed reported to date. The longest high quality waveguides (up to 1m) are also reported. Experiments reveal that Gorilla Glass seems to be an ideal glass to write waveguides just below the surface, which is of great interest in sensing applications. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America"

The apparent enhancement of CpG transversions in primate lineage is a consequence of multiple replacements,"['Borstnik, B', 'Pumpernik, D']",JOURNAL OF BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,10.1142/S0219720014500115,JUN 2014,0,We claim that the apparently enhanced CpG transversions in the form CpG to CpC/GpG or to ApG/CpT are caused by the hypermutable CpG to CpA/TpG transition. The nucleotide replacement counts obtained from the human/chimpanzee/gorilla/orangutan sequence alignments representing the replacements due to the evolutionary species divergence and the results of 1000 genomes project that provide us with the differerences due to the intraspecies diversification were analyzed to estimate the ratio of CpG versus non-CpG transversion probabilities. The trinucleotide replacement counts were extracted from the regions that are free of functional constraints. The CpG transversion probabilities based upon the genomic comparisons were found to exceed more than twice the non-CpG transversions. The diversity data emerging from 14 population groups were partitioned in five classes as a function of the parameter quantifying the spread of the polymorphic allele among the group of individuals. The results based upon the human polymorphism exhibit a trend where CpG over non-CpG transversion probability ratio is less and less exceeding unity as the values of the derived allele frequency (DAF) of snps are diminishing. A computer simulation of a simplified model indicates that the phenomenon of the apparent enhancement of CpG transversions can have its source in the interference of the entropic effects with the maximum likelihood methodologies.

Nowhere are these entanglements more evident than among human communities situated within protected areas. These communities often rely on natural resources, such as wildlife, as an integral component of daily livelihoods. The success of human livelihood strategies and the continued presence of wildlife hinges upon our ability to understand inherently dependent relationships between animals and humans. Using the bushmeat trade as an entry point, this article draws on theoretical developments in anthropology, specifically mutual ecologies and data-based approaches to wildlife management, to examine relationships between hunters and hunted in the Dzanga-Sangha Dense Forest Reserve (APDS)."

"Selective insectivory at Toro-Semliki, Uganda: Comparative analyses suggest no 'savanna' chimpanzee pattern","['Webster, TH', 'McGrew, WC', 'Marchant, LF', 'Payne, CLR', 'Hunt, KD']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.02.005,JUN 2014,2,"Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) insectivory across Africa is ubiquitous. Insects provide a significant nutritional payoff and may be important for chimpanzees in dry, open habitats with narrow diets. We tested this hypothesis at Semliki, Uganda, a long-term dry study site. We evaluated prospects for insectivory by measuring insect abundance along de novo transects and trails, monitoring social insect colonies, and surveying available raw materials for elementary technology. We determined the frequency and nature of insectivory through behavioral observation and fecal analysis. We then compared our results with those from 15 other long-term chimpanzee study sites using a cluster analysis. We found that Semliki chimpanzees are one of the most insectivorous populations studied to date in terms of frequency of consumption, but they are very selective in their insectivory, regularly consuming only weaver ants (Oecophylla longinoda) and honey and bees from hives of Apis mellifera. This selectivity obtains despite having a full range of typical prey species available in harvestable quantities. We suggest that Semliki chimpanzees may face ecological time constraints and therefore bias their predation toward prey taxa that can be quickly consumed. Geographical proximity correlated with the results of the cluster analysis, while rainfall, a relatively gross measure of environment, did not. Because broad taxonomic groups of insects were used in analyses, prey availability was unlikely to have a strong effect on this pattern. Instead, we suggest that transmission of cultural knowledge may play a role in determining chimpanzee prey selection across Africa. Further study is needed to test these hypotheses.

Nutritional contributions of insects to primate diets: Implications for primate evolution,"['Rothman, JM', 'Raubenheimer, D', 'Bryer, MAH', 'Takahashi, M', 'Gilbert, CC']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.02.016,JUN 2014,8,"Insects and other invertebrates form a portion of many living and extinct primate diets. We review the nutritional profiles of insects in comparison with other dietary items, and discuss insect nutrients in relation to the nutritional needs of living primates. We find that insects are incorporated into some primate diets as staple foods whereby they are the majority of food intake. They can also be incorporated as complements to other foods in the diet, providing protein in a diet otherwise dominated by gums and/or fruits, or be incorporated as supplements to likely provide an essential nutrient that is not available in the typical diet. During times when they are very abundant, such as in insect outbreaks, insects can serve as replacements to the usual foods eaten by primates. Nutritionally, insects are high in protein and fat compared with typical dietary items like fruit and vegetation. However, insects are small in size and for larger primates (>1 kg) it is usually nutritionally profitable only to consume insects when they are available in large quantities. In small quantities, they may serve to provide important vitamins and fatty acids typically unavailable in primate diets. In a brief analysis, we found that soft-bodied insects are higher in fat though similar in chitin and protein than hard-bodied insects. In the fossil record, primates can be defined as soft- or hard-bodied insect feeders based on dental morphology. The differences in the nutritional composition of insects may have implications for understanding early primate evolution and ecology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Myrmecophagous microwear: Implications for diet in the hominin fossil record,"['Strait, SG']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.02.013,JUN 2014,0,"An increasing body of data supports the concept that early humans ate invertebrate prey items, especially insects, and that insects may have been a substantial protein source. Insects are ubiquitous throughout the landscape and of high nutritional value. Given that all modern apes and many human groups eat insects, it is likely that early hominins did as well. However, it is unknown how much, which type(s), and what foraging strategy was utilized to obtain invertebrate prey. Given that gross masticatory anatomy of early hominins, like modern apes, fails to reflect their insectivorous proclivities, dental microwear analysis might be a useful tool for identifying this behavior in our fossil ancestors.

Dental microwear data was collected on three primarily myrmecophagous mammals and compared to the literature on other faunivorous, frugivorous, and folivorous species. Results indicate that myrmecophagous species have comparable pit frequencies with other faunivores and pit frequency generally distinguishes them from folivores but not all frugivores. Additionally, myrmecophagous mammals have unusually high feature densities, like other faunivores, and density is the microwear signal most suggestive of some sort of faunivory.

Psychological limits on animal innovation,"['Brosnan, SF', 'Hopper, LM']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.02.026,JUN 2014,7,"Innovation is a way by which animals adopt a new behaviour or apply a current behaviour to a novel situation. Although exploring a new behaviour is itself risky for the animal, a growing body of research indicates that it is fairly widespread across animal species. While there have been explorations of when innovation is most likely and which individuals are most likely to innovate, less has been explored about the psychological mechanisms underlying innovation. Here we consider some psychological limits on innovation. We focus on five factors that my limit the invention of novel behaviours (neophobia, conservatism, conformity, functional fixedness and the endowment effect). The feature common to each of these is that individuals tend to stick with existing behaviours, or the existing uses of those behaviours, rather than exploring novel options. This in turn limits animals' willingness to try less common behaviours unless they are forced through circumstances to explore alternate strategies. Despite the similar functional outcomes, it is critical to understand the underlying mechanisms present in different situations in order to make strong predictions about when innovation is, or is not, expected to emerge. We then consider how transmission biases and social learning mechanisms influence and limit the spread of inventions among individuals. Of course, these 'limits' are beneficial in other circumstances, and throughout this review we consider the trade-offs for these psychological mechanisms.

Concurrently, possible zoonotic Oesophagostomum infections in villagers living near MDNP were assessed from their fecal samples collected during October and November of 2011. In the gorillas, strongylid (Oesophagostomum and/or hookworm) eggs were found in 47 of 235 fecal samples (20.0 %) and Oesophagostomum larvae were detected in 101 of 229 coprocultures (44.1 %). In the villagers, strongylid eggs were found in 9 of 71 fecal samples (12.7 %), but no Oesophagostomum larvae were detected in coprocultures. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit-1 (cox-1) region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of coprocultured Oesophagostomum larvae were amplified using parasite DNA extracted from 7-25 larvae/sample, cloned into Escherichia coli, and sequenced. Sequenced rDNA contained 353/354-bp long ITS1, 151-bp long 5.8S rDNA, and 227-bp long ITS2. Parts of clones showed variations at 1-3 bases in the ITS1 region at a frequency of 24/68 (35.3 %) and at 1-2 bases in the ITS2 region at a frequency of 7/68 (10.3 %), whereas the 5.8S rDNA was essentially identical. Sequenced cox-1 gene of the parasites, 849 bp in length, showed a higher number of nucleotide variations, mainly at the third nucleotide position of the codon. The majority of clones (27/41 (65.9 %)) had an identical amino acid sequence. These results suggest that at MDNP, Gabon, only a single population of O. stephanostomum with a degree of genetic diversity is prevalent in western lowland gorillas, without zoonotic complication in local inhabitants. The possible genetic variations in the ITS region of rDNA and cox-1gene of mtDNA presented here may be valuable when only a limited amount of material is available for the molecular species diagnosis of O. stephanostomum."
Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (Phreatichthys andruzzii),"['Bisazza, A', 'Tagliapietra, C', 'Bertolucci, C', 'Foa, A', 'Agrillo, C', 'AUDITORY-STIMULI']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.101683,JUN 2014,3,"Over a decade of comparative studies, researchers have found that rudimentary numerical abilities are widespread among vertebrates. While experiments in mammals and birds have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all fish studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether fish can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical abilities in Phreatichthys andruzzii, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia desert. Fish were trained to receive a food reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In Experiment 1, subjects learned to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not controlled for non-numerical continuous variables that covary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In Experiment 2, the discrimination was two versus four, with half of the stimuli controlled for continuous quantities and half not controlled for continuous quantities. The subjects discriminated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates tested in similar experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, cavefish trained from the beginning only with stimuli controlled for continuous quantities proved able to learn the discrimination of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost fish tested with visual stimuli."

Evolution of primate alpha and theta defensins revealed by analysis of genomes,"['Li, DY', 'Zhang, L', 'Yin, HD', 'Xu, HL', 'Trask, JS', 'Smith, DG', 'Li, Y', 'Yang, MY', 'Zhu, Q']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS,10.1007/s11033-014-3253-z,JUN 2014,1,"Defensins are endogenous peptides with cysteine-rich antimicrobial ability that contribute to host defence against bacterial, fungal and viral infections. There are three subfamilies of defensins in primates: alpha, beta and theta-defensins. alpha-defensins are most present in neutrophils and Paneth cells; beta-defensins are involved in protecting the skin and the mucous membranes of the respiratory, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts; and theta-defensins are physically distinguished as the only known fully-cyclic peptides of animal origin, which are first isolated from rhesus macaques. All three kinds of defensins have six conserved cysteines, three intramolecular disulfide bonds, a net positive charge, and beta-sheet regions. alpha and theta-defensins are closely related, comparative amino acid sequences showed that the difference between them is that theta-defensins have an additional stop codon limits the initial defensin domain peptides to 12 residues. Humans, chimpanzees and gorillas do not produce theta-defensin peptides due to a premature stop codon present in the signal sequence of all theta-defensin pseudogenes. By using comprehensive computational searches, here we report the discovery of complete repertoires of the alpha and theta-defensin gene family in ten primate species. Consistent with previous studies, our phylogenetic analyses showed all primate theta-defensins evident formed one distinct clusters evolved from alpha-defensins. beta-defensins are ancestors of both alpha and theta-defensins. Human has two copies of DEFA1 and DEFT1P, and two extra DEFA3 and DEFA10P genes compared with gorilla. As different primates inhabit in quite different ecological niches, the production of species-specific alpha and theta-defensins and these highly evolved theta-defensins in old world monkeys would presumably allow them to better respond to the specific microbial challenges that they face."
Conservation of intronic minisatellite polymorphisms in the SCK1/SHC2 gene of Hominidae,"['Yoon, SL', 'Jeong, Y', 'Kim, HS', 'Ahn, EK', 'Seol, SY', 'Lee, SY', 'Roh, YG', 'Gim, JA', 'Hwang, SY', 'Kang, TH', 'Chung, JW', 'Leem, SH']",GENES & GENOMICS,10.1007/s13258-014-0175-z,JUN 2014,0,"The neuronally expressed Shc adaptor homolog SCK1/SHC2 gene contains an unusually high number of minisatellites. In humans, twelve different minisatellite sequences are located in introns of SCK1/SHC2 and ten of them are highly polymorphic. Here we used primers developed for humans to screen ten intronic loci of SCK1/SHC2 in chimpanzee and gorilla, and undertook a comprehensive analysis of the genomic sequence to address the evolutionary events driving these variable repeats. All ten loci amplified in chimpanzee and gorilla contained hypervariable and low-variability minisatellites. The human polymorphic locus TR1 was monomorphic in chimpanzee and gorilla, but we detected polymorphic alleles in these apes for the human monomorphic TR7 locus. When we examined the repeat size among these hominoids, there was no consistent variation by length from humans to great apes. In spite of the inconsistent evolutionary dynamics in repeat length variation, exon 16 was highly conserved between humans and great apes. These results suggest that non-coding intronic minisatellites do not show a consistent evolutionary paradigm but evolved with different patterns among each minisatellite locus. These findings provide important insight for minisatellite conservation during hominoid evolution."
Dominance rank differences in the energy intake and expenditure of female Bwindi mountain gorillas,"['Wright, E', 'Robbins, AM', 'Robbins, MM']",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,10.1007/s00265-014-1708-9,JUN 2014,4,"Socioecological models predict that contest competition for clumped foods can lead to higher energy intake and lower energy expenditure for higher-ranking individuals. Here, we examine the relationships between dominance rank and energy intake and expenditure of female mountain gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda (Gorilla beringei beringei). Bwindi gorillas have weak dominance relationships, feed on nonreproductive plant parts throughout the year, and consume fruit when it is seasonally available. We used behavioral observations on one group of gorillas and nutritional analysis of their major food items to calculate energy intake rates and estimated energy expenditure. Using linear mixed models, we found a significant positive relationship between dominance rank and energy intake rates, due to higher-ranking females having faster ingestion rates, rather than consuming foods with higher energy concentrations. Lower-ranking females did not spend significantly more time feeding to compensate for their lower energy intake rates. Lower-ranking females spent significantly more time traveling than higher-ranking females, leading to a negative relationship between dominance rank and energy expenditure. The combined results revealed a significant positive relationship between dominance rank and energy balance. Higher-ranking females did not spend longer feeding on fruit than lower-ranking ones, and the relationship between dominance rank and energy intake rates was not stronger when fruit was available. According to socioecological models, these results suggest that contest competition may be occurring with both fruit and nonreproductive plant parts, which would be consistent with growing evidence that nonreproductive plant parts can be contestable."
High Rates of Infection with Novel Enterovirus Variants in Wild Populations of Mandrills and Other Old World Monkey Species,"['Van Nguyen, D', 'Harvala, H', 'Ngole, EM', 'Delaporte, E', 'Woolhouse, MEJ', 'Peeters, M', 'Simmonds, P']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.00088-14,JUN 2014,2,"Enteroviruses (EVs) are a genetically and antigenically diverse group of viruses infecting humans. A mostly distinct set of EV variants have additionally been documented to infect wild apes and several, primarily captive, Old World monkey (OWM) species. To investigate the prevalence and genetic characteristics of EVs infecting OWMs in the wild, fecal samples from mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) and other species collected in remote regions of southern Cameroon were screened for EV RNA. Remarkably high rates of EV positivity were detected in M. sphinx (100 of 102 screened), Cercocebus torquatus (7/7), and Cercopithecus cephus (2/4), with high viral loads indicative of active infection. Genetic characterization in VP4/VP2 and VP1 regions allowed EV variants to be assigned to simian species H (EV-H) and EV-J (including one or more new types), while seven matched simian EV-B variants, SA5 and EV110 (chimpanzee). Sequences from the remaining 70 formed a new genetic group distinct in VP4/2 and VP1 region from all currently recognized human or simian EV species. Complete genome sequences were obtained from three to determine their species assignment. In common with EV-J and the EV-A A13 isolate, new group sequences were chimeric, being most closely related to EV-A in capsid genes and to EV-B in the nonstructural gene region. Further recombination events created different groupings in 5' and 3' untranslated regions. While clearly a distinct EV group, the hybrid nature of new variants prevented their unambiguous classification as either members of a new species or as divergent members of EV-A using current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) assignment criteria."
Macroscopic Inspection of Ape Feces: What's in a Quantification Method?,"['Phillips, CA', 'McGrew, WC']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22246,JUN 2014,3,"Macroscopic inspection of feces has been used to investigate primate diet. The limitations of this method to identify food-items to species level have long been recognized, but ascertaining aspects of diet (e.g., folivory) are achievable by quantifying food-items in feces. Quantification methods applied include rating food-items using a scale of abundance, estimating their percentage volume, and weighing food-items. However, verification as to whether or not composition data differ, depending on which quantification method is used during macroscopic inspection, has not been done. We analyzed feces collected from ten adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) of the Kanyawara community in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We compare dietary composition totals obtained from using different quantification methods and ascertain if sieve mesh size influences totals calculated. Finally, this study validates findings from direct observation of feeding by the same individuals from whom the fecal samples had been collected. Contrasting diet composition totals obtained by using different quantification methods and sieve mesh sizes can influence folivory and frugivory estimates. However, our findings were based on the assumption that fibrous matter contained pith and leaf fragments only, which remains to be verified. We advocate macroscopic inspection of feces can be a valuable tool to provide a generalized overview of dietary composition for primate populations. As most populations remain unhabituated, scrutinizing and validating indirect measures are important if they are to be applied to further understand inter- and intra-species dietary variation. Am. J.

Molecular Evolution of the Primate alpha-/theta-Defensin Multigene Family,"['Cheng, DQ', 'Li, Y', 'Huang, JF']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0097425,MAY 12 2014,1,"The primate alpha-/theta-defensin multigene family encodes versatile endogenous cationic and amphipathic peptides that have broad-spectrum antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activity. Although previous studies have reported that alpha-/theta-defensin (DEFA/DEFT) genes are under birth-and-death evolution with frequent duplication and rapid evolution, the phylogenetic relationships of the primate DEFA/DEFT genes; the genetic bases for the existence of similar antimicrobial spectra among closely related species; and the evolutionary processes involved in the emergence of cyclic theta-defensins in Old World monkeys and their subsequent loss of function in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas require further investigation. In this study, the DEFA/DEFT gene repertoires from primate and treeshrew were collected, followed by detailed phylogenetic, sequence and structure, selection pressure and comparative genomics analyses. All treeshrew, prosimian and simian DEFA/DEFT genes are grouped into two major clades, which are tissue-specific for enteric and myeloid defensins in simians. The simian enteric and myeloid alpha-defensins are classified into six functional gene clusters with diverged sequences, variable structures, altered functional constraints and different selection pressures, which likely reflect the antimicrobial spectra among closely related species. Species-specific duplication or pseudogenization within each simian cluster implies that the antimicrobial spectrum is ever-shifting, most likely challenged by the ever-changing pathogen environment. The DEFT evolved from the myeloid DEFA8. The prosegment of theta-defensin is detected with adaptive changes coevolving with the new protein fold of mature peptide, coincident with the importance of the prosegment for the correct folding of the mature peptide. Lastly, a less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis was proposed as a possible explanation for the expansion of pseudogene DEFTP and the loss of functional DEFT, where the gain or loss of the hitchhiker is determined by its adjacent driver gene during the birth-and-death evolutionary process."
Evolutionary conservation in genes underlying human psychiatric disorders,"['Ogawa, LM', 'Vallender, EJ', 'AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS']",FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE,10.3389/fnhum.2014.00283,MAY 6 2014,2,"Many psychiatric diseases observed in humans have tenuous or absent analogs in other species. Most notable among these are schizophrenia and autism. One hypothesis has posited that these diseases have arisen as a consequence of human brain evolution, for example, that the same processes that led to advances in cognition, language, and executive function also resulted in novel diseases in humans when dysfunctional. Here, the molecular evolution of the protein-coding regions of genes associated with these and other psychiatric disorders are compared among species. Genes associated with psychiatric disorders are drawn from the literature and orthologous sequences are collected from eleven primate species (human, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, macaque, baboon, marmoset, squirrel monkey, and galago) and 34 non-primate mammalian species. Evolutionary parameters, including d(N)/d(S), are calculated for each gene and compared between disease classes and among species, focusing on humans and primates compared to other mammals, and on large-brained taxa (cetaceans, rhinoceros, walrus, bear, and elephant) compared to their small-brained sister species. Evidence of differential selection in humans to the exclusion of non-human primates was absent, however elevated d(N)/d(S) was detected in catarrhines as a whole, as well as in cetaceans, possibly as part of a more general trend. Although this may suggest that protein changes associated with schizophrenia and autism are not a cost of the higher brain function found in humans, it may also point to insufficiencies in the study of these diseases including incomplete or inaccurate gene association lists and/or a greater role of regulatory changes or copy number variation. Through this work a better understanding of the molecular evolution of the human brain, the pathophysiology of disease, and the genetic basis of human psychiatric disease is gained."
MicroRNA Profiling Implies New Markers of Chemoresistance of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"['Ouyang, M', 'Li, YX', 'Ye, S', 'Ma, JY', 'Lu, LM', 'Lv, WM', 'Chang, GQ', 'Li, XX', 'Li, Q', 'Wang, SM', 'Wang, WJ']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0096228,MAY 2 2014,28,"Objective: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with truly chemosensitive disease still represent a minority among all TNBC patients. The aim of the present study is to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that correlate with TNBC chemoresistance.

Methods: In this study, we conducted miRNAs profile comparison between triple-negative breast cancer (TNBCs) and normal breast tissues by microRNA array. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was utilized to confirm the specific deregulated miRNAs change trend. We used starBase 2.1 and GOrilla to predict the potential targets of the specific miRNAs. Cells viability and apoptosis assays were employed to determine the effect of alteration of the specific miRNAs in TNBC cells on the chemosensitivity.

Results: We identified 11 specific deregulated miRNAs, including 5 up-regulated miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-21-3p, miR-181a-5p, miR-181b-5p, and miR-183-5p) and 6 down-regulated miRNAs (miR-10b-5p, miR-451a, miR-125b-5p, miR-31-5p, miR-195-5p and miR-130a-3p). Thereafter, this result was confirmed by qRT-PCR. We predicted the potential targets of the candidate miRNAs and found that they are involved in cancer-associated pathways. For the first time, we found that miR-130a-3p and miR-451a were down-regulated in TNBC. 9 of the 11 specific deregulated miRNAs were found to be associated with chemoresistance. In vitro assays, we found that up-regulation of either miR-130a-3p or miR-451a in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly changed the cells sensitivity to doxorubicin. The results suggest that TNBC chemotherapy might be affected by a cluster of miRNAs.

Conclusion: The abnormal expression miRNAs in TNBC are mainly chemoresistance related. This might be part of reason that TNBC likely to evade from chemotherapy resulting in early relapse and high risk of death. To alter their expression status might be a potential therapeutic strategy to improve the outcome of chemotherapy for TNBC patients."

Similarly, iPSCs from non-human primates should be a central tool to understand human evolution, in particular for assessing the conservation of regulatory networks in iPSC models.

Here, we have generated human, gorilla, bonobo and cynomolgus monkey iPSCs and assess their usefulness in such a framework. We show that these cells are well comparable in their differentiation potential and are generally similar to human, cynomolgus and rhesus monkey embryonic stem cells (ESCs). RNA sequencing reveals that expression differences among clones, individuals and stem cell type are all of very similar magnitude within a species. In contrast, expression differences between closely related primate species are three times larger and most genes show significant expression differences among the analyzed species. However, pseudogenes differ more than twice as much, suggesting that evolution of expression levels in primate stem cells is rapid, but constrained. These patterns in pluripotent stem cells are comparable to those found in other tissues except testis. Hence, primate iPSCs reveal insights into general primate gene expression evolution and should provide a rich source to identify conserved and species-specific gene expression patterns for cellular phenotypes.

We presented all four species of nonhuman great apes (N = 36) with a choice between 2 opaque, upside down cups after displacing them out of sight from their starting positions. Crucially, 1 of them had left a yogurt trail behind it. Great apes spontaneously used the trail to select the yogurt baited cup. Follow-up experiments demonstrated that chimpanzees distinguished trails based on the temporal order of cause and effect by ignoring trails that were already present before the reward was hidden. Additionally, chimpanzees did not select cups based on the amount of yogurt near them but instead preferred cups that signaled the endpoint of the trail. We conclude that apes' choices reveal sensitivity to a causal relation between cause (reward) and effect (trail) including their temporal order."

Immature females from infancy to young adulthood maintained relatively frequent proximity to both their mothers and the silverback male and spent little time alone (no animals within 10 m), with relatively large individual differences. On the other hand, immature males decreased the time spent near their mothers and the silverback male and increased the time spent alone with increasing age. Therefore, sex differences in proximity to mothers and the silverback male became apparent after late juvenility. Some adult females maintained increased frequency of proximity to the silverback male than that by other females over the 12-year period, indicating the presence of long-term, stable proximity relationships between the silverback male and the adult females. Such long-term, stable proximity relationships were also observed among adult females. Some association patterns reported in wild gorillas, such as frequent proximity between adult females with dependent offspring and the silverback male and close relationships between related females, were not observed in the present study. The idiosyncratic or individual factors influencing some association patterns were easily reflected in captive situations. (C) 2014 The Authors. Zoo Biology Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
The Effects of Auditory Enrichment on Gorillas,"['Robbins, L', 'Margulis, SW']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21127,MAY-JUN 2014,2,"Several studies have demonstrated that auditory enrichment can reduce stereotypic behaviors in captive animals. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative effectiveness of three different types of auditory enrichment-naturalistic sounds, classical music, and rock music-in reducing stereotypic behavior displayed by Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Three gorillas (one adult male, two adult females) were observed at the Buffalo Zoo for a total of 24 hr per music trial. Acontrol observation period, during which no sounds were presented, was also included. Each music trial consisted of a total of three weeks with a 1-week control period in between each music type. The results reveal a decrease in stereotypic behaviors from the control period to naturalistic sounds. The naturalistic sounds also affected patterns of several other behaviors including locomotion. In contrast, stereotypy increased in the presence of classical and rock music. These results suggest that auditory enrichment, which is not commonly used in zoos in a systematic way, can be easily utilized by keepers to help decrease stereotypic behavior, but the nature of the stimulus, as well as the differential responses of individual animals, need to be considered.

We investigated whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) can remember different food locations after minimal exposure (i.e., 1-2 trials) both after 24hr and after 3-month. We released pairs of chimpanzees in their indoor enclosure (the enclosure of group A measured 430m(2) and group B's measured 175m(2)) and tested them for four consecutive days (Baseline, Test, Retest, and Post-test). During the Test and Retest food was hidden in the same location whereas no food was hidden during the Baseline and Post-test days (control trials). Subjects were tested with four different locations and assessed for their retention after 24hr and 3-month since the initial food discovery.

On other trials, number of dots was incongruent with area. The gorillas were first tested with static dots, then with dots that moved within the arrays, and finally on a task where they were required to discriminate numerically larger subsets within arrays of moving dots. Both gorillas achieved above-chance performance on both congruent and incongruent trials with all tasks, indicating that they were able to use number as a cue even though ratio of number and area significantly controlled responding, suggesting that number was not the only relevant dimension that the gorillas used. The pattern of performance was similar to that found previously with monkeys and chimpanzees but had not previously been demonstrated in gorillas within a computerized test format, and with these kinds of visual stimuli."
Trabecular Bone Structure in the Primate Wrist,"['Schilling, AM', 'Tofanelli, S', 'Hublin, JJ', 'Kivell, TL']",JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY,10.1002/jmor.20238,MAY 2014,1,"Trabecular (or cancellous) bone has been shown to respond to mechanical loading throughout ontogeny and thus can provide unique insight into skeletal function and locomotion in comparative studies of living and fossil mammalian morphology. Trabecular bone of the hand may be particularly functionally informative because the hand has more direct contact with the substrate compared with the remainder of the forelimb during locomotion in quadrupedal mammals. This study investigates the trabecular structure within the wrist across a sample of haplorhine primates that vary in locomotor behaviour (and thus hand use) and body size. High-resolution microtomographic scans were collected of the lunate, scaphoid, and capitate in 41 individuals and eight genera (Homo, Gorilla, Pan, Papio, Pongo, Symphalangus, Hylobates, and Ateles). We predicted that particular trabecular parameters would 1) vary across suspensory, quadrupedal, and bipedal primates based on differences in hand use and load, and 2) scale with carpal size following similar allometric patterns found previously in other skeletal elements across a larger sample of mammals and primates. Analyses of variance (trabecular parameters analysed separately) and principal component analyses (trabecular parameters analysed together) revealed no clear functional signal in the trabecular structure of any of the three wrist bones. Instead, there was a large degree of variation within suspensory and quadrupedal locomotor groups, as well as high intrageneric variation within some taxa, particularly Pongo and Gorilla. However, as predicted, Homo sapiens, which rarely use their hands for locomotion and weight support, were unique in showing lower relative bone volume (BV/TV) compared with all other taxa. Furthermore, parameters used to quantify trabecular structure within the wrist scale with size generally following similar allometric patterns found in trabeculae of other mammalian skeletal elements.

"Chimpanzees Preferentially Select Sleeping Platform Construction Tree Species with Biomechanical Properties that Yield Stable, Firm, but Compliant Nests","['Samson, DR', 'Hunt, KD']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0095361,APR 16 2014,1,"The daily construction of a sleeping platform or ""nest"" is a universal behavior among large-bodied hominoids. Among chimpanzees, most populations consistently select particular tree species for nesting, yet the principles that guide species preferences are poorly understood. At Semliki, Cynometra alexandri constitutes only 9.6% of all trees in the gallery forest in which the study populations ranges, but it was selected for 73.6% of the 1,844 chimpanzee night beds we sampled. To determine whether physical properties influence nesting site selection, we measured the physical characteristics of seven common tree species at the Toro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve, Uganda. We determined stiffness and bending strength for a sample of 326 branches from the seven most commonly used tree species. We selected test-branches with diameters typically used for nest construction. We measured internode distance, calculated mean leaf surface area (cm(2)) and assigned a tree architecture category to each of the seven species. C. alexandri fell at the extreme of the sample for all four variables and shared a tree architecture with only one other of the most commonly selected species. C. alexandri was the stiffest and had the greatest bending strength; it had the smallest internode distance and the smallest leaf surface area. C. alexandri and the second most commonly selected species, Cola gigantea, share a 'Model of Koriba' tree architecture. We conclude that chimpanzees are aware of the structural properties of C. alexandri branches and choose it because its properties afford chimpanzees sleeping platforms that are firm, stable and resilient."

In Experiments 1 and 2, participants saw pictured objects and had to state either their size (GRAND or PETITmeaning big and small) or their name. The size of the objects varied as a function of the way they were presented on the computer screen (Experiment 1) or their real size in the world (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, faces of young and old men were coloured in yellow or in green. The task was to name either the colour (JAUNE or VERT, meaning yellow and green, respectively) or the age (JEUNE or VIEUX, meaning young and old, respectively) of the face. In Experiments 1 and 2, no reliable effects of phonological relatedness (GORILLE-granda big gorilla) were found on the object-naming latencies. However, size-naming latencies were shorter when the adjective shared the initial phoneme of the picture name (i.e., GRAND-gorille) than when it did not (i.e., GRAND-dinosauresaying big in response to a big dinosaur). In Experiment 3, phonological overlap did not affect colour naming latencies, or age naming latencies. Overall, these findings strongly suggest that cascaded processing is restricted to the object's identity in conceptually driven naming tasks."
Nest Grouping Patterns of Bonobos (Pan paniscus) in Relation to Fruit Availability in a Forest-Savannah Mosaic,"['Serckx, A', 'Huynen, MC', 'Bastin, JF', 'Hambuckers, A', 'Beudels-Jamar, RC', 'Vimond, M', 'Raynaud, E', 'Kuhl, HS']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0093742,APR 2 2014,7,"A topic of major interest in socio-ecology is the comparison of chimpanzees and bonobos' grouping patterns. Numerous studies have highlighted the impact of social and environmental factors on the different evolution in group cohesion seen in these sister species. We are still lacking, however, key information about bonobo social traits across their habitat range, in order to make accurate inter-species comparisons. In this study we investigated bonobo social cohesiveness at nesting sites depending on fruit availability in the forest-savannah mosaic of western Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a bonobo habitat which has received little attention from researchers and is characterized by high food resource variation within years. We collected data on two bonobo communities. Nest counts at nesting sites were used as a proxy for night grouping patterns and were analysed with regard to fruit availability. We also modelled bonobo population density at the site in order to investigate yearly variation. We found that one community density varied across the three years of surveys, suggesting that this bonobo community has significant variability in use of its home range. This finding highlights the importance of forest connectivity, a likely prerequisite for the ability of bonobos to adapt their ranging patterns to fruit availability changes. We found no influence of overall fruit availability on bonobo cohesiveness. Only fruit availability at the nesting sites showed a positive influence, indicating that bonobos favour food 'hot spots' as sleeping sites. Our findings have confirmed the results obtained from previous studies carried out in the dense tropical forests of DRC. Nevertheless, in order to clarify the impact of environmental variability on bonobo social cohesiveness, we will need to make direct observations of the apes in the forest-savannah mosaic as well as make comparisons across the entirety of the bonobos' range using systematic methodology."
Assessing reintroduction success in long-lived primates through population viability analysis: western lowland gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla in Central Africa,"['King, T', 'Chamberlan, C', 'Courage, A']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605312001391,APR 2014,1,"The use of population modelling has become an increasingly common tool in reintroduction planning and assessment. Although initial reintroduction success is often measured by quantifying post-release survival and reproduction, longer-term success is best assessed through measurements of population viability. Here we develop a population model capable of providing useful results for influencing management of a reintroduction programme for a long-lived and slow-reproducing primate, the western lowland gorilla Gorilla gorilla gorilla. We used post-release monitoring data from two reintroduced populations in the Bateke Plateau region of Congo and Gabon, complemented with published data on wild and captive populations, to develop a population model using Vortex. Sensitivity testing illustrated that the model was highly sensitive to changes in the input parameters for annual birth rates, the number of lethal equivalents, and for female annual mortality rates, especially for adults. The results of the population viability analysis suggested that the reintroduced gorilla populations have a reasonable chance of persistence (>90% over 200 years) but illustrated that reinforcement of the populations could significantly improve probabilities of population persistence and retention of genetic diversity. Equally, catastrophic events could have significant negative impacts. Continued monitoring of the populations should allow refinement of the model, improving confidence in its predictions and its relevance to decision-making."

However, concerns are growing about the potentially negative influence of such tourism on the wildlife involved. We investigate the effects of habituation, ecotourism and research activities on levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGCMs), a proxy for physiological stress, in wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in the Central African Republic. We compare FGCMs in three human-contacted groups with those in unhabituated gorillas. We also explore how human-gorilla contact influences FGCMs of a gorilla group undergoing habituation and investigate how measures of general human-gorilla contact, tourism and human proximity influence FGCMs in recently and long-term habituated groups. Two of the three human-contacted groups had higher levels of FGCMs than unhabituated gorillas. The group undergoing habituation had the highest FGCMs, which increased up to 21 days following contacts, suggesting a cumulative FGCM response, in line with descriptions of a hormonal adaptation response to a chronic intermittent stressor. FGCMs in habituated groups were significantly associated with increasing frequency of violation of the 7 m distance rule by observers and with a medical intervention but not with other measures of human pressure. Our findings provide critical information for the management of this, and other, species whose conservation depends on habituation for ecotourism.

A Population Estimate of Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the Ugalla Region Using Standard and Spatially Explicit Genetic Capture-Recapture Methods,"['Moore, DL', 'Vigilant, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22237,APR 2014,3,"Population parameters such as size, density, and distribution of a species across a landscape are important metrics that inform conservation science and are key to management strategies. In this study, we used genetic capture-recapture methods to estimate the population size and density of the little-studied chimpanzees in the Ugalla region of western Tanzania. From 237 fecal samples collected non-invasively over a 10-month period, we identified a minimum of 113 individuals. Based on the two-innate rate method (TIRM) modeled in the software capwire, we obtained a maximum-likelihood estimate of 322 (CI 227-373) individuals over the 624km(2) area surveyed. Using a spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) method, we estimated a population density of 0.25 (CI 0.16-0.38) individuals/km(2). Observations of nests and search effort data revealed areas of more intense usage. The findings of this study are an important step in the characterization of the Ugalla chimpanzees, and substantially improve our understanding of the number of chimpanzees that occupy this savanna-woodland region at the easternmost extent of the geographic range of this endangered subspecies.

Autonomy in chimpanzees,"['Beauchamp, TL', 'Wobber, V']",THEORETICAL MEDICINE AND BIOETHICS,10.1007/s11017-014-9287-3,APR 2014,2,"Literature on the mental capacities and cognitive mechanisms of the great apes has been silent about whether they can act autonomously. This paper provides a philosophical theory of autonomy supported by psychological studies of the cognitive mechanisms that underlie chimpanzee behavior to argue that chimpanzees can act autonomously even though their psychological mechanisms differ from those of humans. Chimpanzees satisfy the two basic conditions of autonomy: (1) liberty (the absence of controlling influences) and (2) agency (self-initiated intentional action), each of which is specified here in terms of conditions of understanding, intention, and self-control. In this account, chimpanzees make knowledge-based choices reflecting a richly information-based and socially sophisticated understanding of the world. Finally, two major theories of autonomy (Kantian theory and two-level theory) are rejected as too narrow to adequately address these issues, necessitating the modifications made in the present approach."
The Effect of Fission-Fusion Zoo Housing on Hormonal and Behavioral Indicators of Stress in Bornean Orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus),"['Amrein, M', 'Heistermann, M', 'Weingrill, T']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-014-9765-5,APR 2014,2,"The welfare of captive animals could be improved if zoos were to place more emphasis on their species-specific needs. In the wild, orangutans live in a fission-fusion social system and have a semisolitary lifestyle. However, most zoos keep orangutans in permanent groups, which may be stressful for them. Apenheul Primate Park in Apeldoorn, Netherlands, houses 14 Bornean orangutans in a simulated fission-fusion social system. To assess how this housing system affects indicators of stress, we measured fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCM) and determined proportions of self-directed behavior (scratching and autogrooming). We compared fGCM concentrations of the Apenheul animals to those of zoo orangutans kept in permanent groups. In addition, we tested the effect of group size, visitor number, sex, age, and change of group composition on fGCM concentrations and proportions of self-directed behavior in the Apenheul orangutans. In contrast to Bornean orangutans housed in permanent groups, we did not find a group size effect on fGCM or on self-directed behavior in Apenheul's fission-fusion housing system. In addition, fGCM concentrations in Apenheul orangutans increased significantly with visitor numbers. Visitor number also affected proportions of self-directed behavior, and mean proportions of scratching were positively correlated with mean values of fGCM concentrations. Although these results suggest that the fission-fusion housing system in Apenheul reduces the group size effect leading to social stress in Bornean orangutans, they also show that visitors are an important factor that needs to be mitigated if the well-being of captive primates and other zoo animals is to be improved."
"The effect of canopy closure on chimpanzee nest abundance in Lagoas de Cufada National Park, Guinea-Bissau","['Sousa, J', 'Casanova, C', 'Barata, AV', 'Sousa, C']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-013-0402-2,APR 2014,0,"The present study aimed to gather baseline information about chimpanzee nesting and density in Lagoas de Cufada Natural Park (LCNP), in Guinea-Bissau. Old and narrow trails were followed to estimate chimpanzee density through marked-nest counts and to test the effect of canopy closure (woodland savannah, forest with a sparse canopy, and forest with a dense canopy) on nest distribution. Chimpanzee abundance was estimated at 0.79 nest builders/km(2), the lowest among the areas of Guinea-Bissau with currently studied chimpanzee populations. Our data suggest that subhumid forest with a dense canopy accounts for significantly higher chimpanzee nest abundance (1.50 nests/km of trail) than sub-humid forest with a sparse canopy (0.49 nests/km of trail) or woodland savannah (0.30 nests/km of trail). Dense-canopy forests play an important role in chimpanzee nesting in the patchy and highly humanized landscape of LCNP. The tree species most frequently used for nesting are Dialium guineense (46 %) and Elaeis guineensis (28 %). E. guineensis contain nests built higher in the canopy, while D. guineense contain nests built at lower heights. Nests observed during baseline sampling and replications suggest seasonal variations in the tree species used for nest building."
Resequencing studies of nonmodel organisms using closely related reference genomes: optimal experimental designs and bioinformatics approaches for population genomics,"['Nevado, B', 'Ramos-Onsins, SE', 'Perez-Enciso, M']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1111/mec.12693,APR 2014,9,"Decreasing costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments have made a wide range of genomic questions open for study with nonmodel organisms. However, experimental designs and analysis of NGS data from less well-known species are challenging because of the lack of genomic resources. In this work, we investigate the performance of alternative experimental designs and bioinformatics approaches in estimating variability and neutrality tests based on the site-frequency-spectrum (SFS) from individual resequencing data. We pay particular attention to challenges faced in the study of nonmodel organisms, in particular the absence of a species-specific reference genome, although phylogenetically close genomes are assumed to be available. We compare the performance of three alternative bioinformatics approaches - genotype calling, genotype-haplotype calling and direct estimation without calling genotypes. We find that relying on genotype calls provides biased estimates of population genetic statistics at low to moderate read depth (2-8x). Genotype-haplotype calling returns more accurate estimates irrespective of the divergence to the reference genome, but requires moderate depth (8-20x). Direct estimation without calling genotypes returns the most accurate estimates of variability and of most SFS tests investigated, including at low read depth (2-4x). Studies without species-specific reference genome should thus aim for low read depth and avoid genotype calling whenever individual genotypes are not essential. Otherwise, aiming for moderate to high depth at the expense of number of individuals, and using genotype-haplotype calling, is recommended."
Apes are intuitive statisticians,"['Rakoczy, H', 'Cluver, A', 'Saucke, L', 'Stoffregen, N', 'Grabener, A', 'Migura, J', 'Call, J']",COGNITION,10.1016/j.cognition.2013.12.011,APR 2014,7,"Inductive learning and reasoning, as we use it both in everyday life and in science, is characterized by flexible inferences based on statistical information: inferences from populations to samples and vice versa. Many forms of such statistical reasoning have been found to develop late in human ontogeny, depending on formal education and language, and to be fragile even in adults. New revolutionary research, however, suggests that even preverbal human infants make use of intuitive statistics. Here, we conducted the first investigation of such intuitive statistical reasoning with non-human primates. In a series of 7 experiments, Bonobos, Chimpanzees, Gorillas and Orangutans drew flexible statistical inferences from populations to samples. These inferences, furthermore, were truly based on statistical information regarding the relative frequency distributions in a population, and not on absolute frequencies. Intuitive statistics in its most basic form is thus an evolutionarily more ancient rather than a uniquely human capacity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The Dmanisi assemblage represents the earliest evidence of hominins outside Africa with an age of 1.8 Ma. D2600 is the holotype of Homo georgicus species and its taxonomic assignment is still under debate. Our study reveals severe and unusual dental wear accompanied of extensive root exposure and dental axial migration, periapical abscesses and enamel fractures. In addition, there is evidence of post-eruptive tooth rotation and temporomandibular arthropathy. We propose that the wear pattern observed in this individual is related to a diet with a high intake of fibrous and abrasive foods such as fruits and plants, as it is usually recorded in chimpanzees and gorillas and unlike the wear pattern observed in other Homo specimens of our comparative sample. The rounded occlusal surfaces and highly polished labio-lingual surfaces of D2600 anterior teeth could be mainly the consequence of pre- and/or para-masticatory activities such as gripping and stripping. This type of food would be also the origin of the highly cupped occlusal morphology of the posterior dentition in combination with relatively slight approximal attrition. However, the lesions exhibited by D2600 have not significantly altered the morphology of the mandible and do not prevent a proper taxonomic assessment. (C) 2013 Academie des sciences.

Changes of community composition at multiple trophic levels due to hunting in Nigerian tropical forests,"['Effiom, EO', 'Birkhofer, K', 'Smith, HG', 'Olsson, O']",ECOGRAPHY,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00359.x,APR 2014,4,"Hunting in tropical forests decimates large mammals, and this may have direct and indirect effects on other trophic levels and lead to trophic cascades. We compared replicated sites of hunted and protected forests in southeastern Nigeria, with respect to community composition of primates, other mammals, birds, plant seedlings, and mature trees. We make predictions regarding the community composition at the different trophic levels. In forests where large primates are rare, we hypothesize that their ecological role will not be fully compensated for by small frugivores. We apply multivariate methods to assess changes in community composition of mammals, birds, and seedlings, controlling for any differences between sites in the other groups, including mature trees. Medium and large (4-180 kg) primates were much rarer in hunted sites, while porcupine and rock hyrax increased in abundance with hunting. In contrast, the community composition of birds was similar in both types of forests. Seedling communities were significantly related to the community composition of mammals, and thus strongly affected by hunting. In protected forests primate dispersed plant seedling species dominated, whereas in hunted forests the seedling community was shifted towards one dominated by abiotically dispersed species. This was probably both a consequence of reduced seed dispersal by primates, and increased seed predation by rodents and hyrax. Hence we found no evidence for buffering effects on tree regeneration through functional compensation by non-hunted animals (such as birds). Our results highlight how seedling communities are changed by the complex plant-animal intera ctions, triggered by the loss of seed dispersers. The results predict a rarity of primate-dispersed trees in future tropical forest canopies; a forest less diverse in timber and non-timber resources."
Ecological Divergence and Talar Morphology in Gorillas,"['Dunn, RH', 'Tocheri, MW', 'Orr, CM', 'Jungers, WL', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22451,APR 2014,9,"Gorillas occupy a variety of habitats from the west coast to eastern central Africa. These habitats differ considerably in altitude, which has a pronounced effect on forest ecology. Although all gorillas are obligate terrestrial knuckle-walking quadrupeds, those that live in lowland habitats eat fruits and climb more often than do those living in highland habitats. Here we test the hypothesis that gorilla talus morphology falls along a morphocline that tracks locomotor function related to a more inverted or everted foot set. This proposed morphocline predicts that gorillas living in lowland habitats may have a talocrural joint configured to facilitate a more medially oriented foot during climbing, suggesting that they may be more adaptively committed to arboreality than gorillas living in highland habitats. To quantify the relative set of the foot in gorillas, we chose two three-dimensional measurements of the talocrural joint: mediolateral curvature of the trochlea and relative surface area of the lateral malleolus. Our results show that, in comparison to their eastern counterparts, western gorillas have talar features that reflect a more medially directed sole of the foot. This morphology likely facilitates foot placement in a wider range of positions and minimization of shearing stresses across the joint when the foot is loaded on more curved or vertically oriented substrates as occurs during climbing and other arboreal behaviors. In contrast, eastern gorilla talar morphology is consistent with habitual placement of the foot with the sole directed more inferiorly, suggesting more effective loading during plantigrade push-off on terrestrial substrates.

We performed an evolutionary analysis of ALR genes (MNDA, PYHIN1, IFI16, and AIM2) by analyzing inter- and intraspecies diversity. Maximum-likelihood analyses indicated that IFI16 and AIM2 evolved adaptively in primates, with branch-specific selection at the catarrhini lineage for IFI16. Application of a population genetics-phylogenetics approach also allowed identification of positive selection events in the human lineage. Positive selection in primates targeted sites located at the DNA-binding interface in both IFI16 and AIM2. In IFI16, several sites positively selected in primates and in the human lineage were located in the PYD domain, which is involved in protein-protein interaction and is bound by a human cytomegalovirus immune evasion protein. Finally, positive selection was found to target nuclear localization signals in IFI16 and the spacer region separating the two HIN domains. Population genetic analysis in humans revealed that an IFI16 genic region has been a target of long-standing balancing selection, possibly acting on two nonsynonymous polymorphisms located in the spacer region. Data herein indicate that ALRs have been repeatedly targeted by natural selection. The balancing selection region in IFI16 carries a variant with opposite risk effect for distinct autoimmune diseases, suggesting antagonistic pleiotropy. We propose that the underlying scenario is the result of an ancestral and still ongoing host-pathogen arms race and that the maintenance of susceptibility alleles for autoimmune diseases at IFI16 represents an evolutionary trade-off."
Differences in the early cognitive development of children and great apes,"['Wobber, V', 'Herrmann, E', 'Hare, B', 'Wrangham, R', 'Tomasello, M']",DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY,10.1002/dev.21125,APR 2014,8,"There is very little research comparing great ape and human cognition developmentally.

We then followed a group of juvenile apes (n = 44) longitudinally over 3 years to track their cognitive development in greater detail. In skills of physical cognition (space, causality, quantities), children and apes performed comparably at 2 years of age, but by 4 years of age children were more advanced (whereas apes stayed at their 2-year-old performance levels). In skills of social cognition (communication, social learning, theory of mind), children out-performed apes already at 2 years, and increased this difference even more by 4 years. Patterns of development differed more between children and apes in the social domain than the physical domain, with support for these patterns present in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal ape data sets. These results indicate key differences in the pattern and pace of cognitive development between humans and other apes, particularly in the early emergence of specific social cognitive capacities in humans.

Socioecological correlates of energy balance using urinary C-peptide measurements in wild female mountain gorillas,"['Grueter, CC', 'Deschner, T', 'Behringer, V', 'Fawcett, K', 'Robbins, MM']",PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR,10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.01.009,MAR 29 2014,5,"Maintaining a balanced energy budget is important for survival and reproduction, but measuring energy balance in wild animals has been fraught with difficulties. Female mountain gorillas are interesting subjects to examine environmental correlates of energy balance because their diet is primarily herbaceous vegetation, their food supply shows little seasonal variation and is abundant, yet they live in cooler, high-altitude habitats that may bring about energetic challenges. Social and reproductive parameters may also influence energy balance. Urinary C-peptide (UCP) has emerged as a valuable non-invasive biomarker of energy balance in primates. Here we use this method to investigate factors influencing energy balance in mountain gorillas of the Virunga Volcanoes, Rwanda. We examined a range of socioecological variables on energy balance in adult females in three groups monitored by the Karisoke Research Center over nine months. Three variables had significant effects on UCP levels: habitat (highest levels in the bamboo zone), season (highest levels in November during peak of the bamboo shoot availability) and day time (gradually increasing from early morning to early afternoon). There was no significant effect of reproductive state and dominance rank. Our study indicates that even in species that inhabit an area with a seemingly steady food supply, ecological variability can have pronounced effects on female energy balance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 1056 clones were sequenced for Cyt-b and COI gene libraries, which contained 50 and 56 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), respectively. BLAST research revealed that the OTUs belonged to 32 families from 5 orders (Diptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Orthoptera). While ants were not detected by this method, the consumption of flies, beetles, moths, mosquitoes and termites was evident in these samples. Our findings indicate that molecular techniques can be used to analyze insect food items in wild animals."
Evolutionary appearance of von Econorno's neurons in the mammalian cerebral cortex,"['Cauda, F', 'Geminiani, GC', 'Vercelli, A', 'DEFAULT-MODE NETWORKS']",FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE,10.3389/fnhum.2014.00104,MAR 14 2014,5,"von Economo's neurons (VENs) are large, spindle-shaped projection neurons in layer V of the frontoinsular (El) cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex. During human ontogenesis, the VENs can first be differentiated at late stages of gestation, and increase in number during the first eight postnatal months. VENs have been identified in humans, chimpanzee, bonobos, gorillas, orangutan and, more recently, in the macaque. Their distribution in great apes seems to correlate with human-like social cognitive abilities and self-awareness. VENs are also found in whales, in a number of different cetaceans, and in the elephant. This phylogenetic distribution may suggest a correlation among the VENs, brain size and the ""social brain."" VENs may be involved in the pathogenesis of specific neurological and psychiatric diseases, such as autism, callosal agenesis and schizophrenia. VENs are selectively affected in a behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia in which empathy, social awareness and self-control are seriously compromised, thus associating VENs with the social brain. However, the presence of VENs has also been related to special functions such as mirror self-recognition. Areas containing VENs have been related to motor awareness or sense-of-knowing, discrimination between self and other, and between self and the external environment. Along this line, VENs have been related to the ""global Workspace"" architecture: in accordance the VENs have been correlated to emotional and interoceptive signals by providing fast connections (large axons = fast communication) between salience-related insular and cingulate and other widely separated brain areas. Nevertheless, the lack of a characterization of their physiology and anatomical connectivity allowed only to infer their functional role based on their location and on the functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The recent finding of VENs in the anterior insula of the macaque opens the way to new insights and experimental investigations."
Hierarchical Partitioning of Metazoan Protein Conservation Profiles Provides New Functional Insights,"['Witztum, J', 'Persi, E', 'Horn, D', 'Pasmanik-Chor, M', 'Chor, B']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0090282,MAR 4 2014,0,"The availability of many complete, annotated proteomes enables the systematic study of the relationships between protein conservation and functionality. We explore this question based solely on the presence or absence of protein homologues (a.k.a. conservation profiles). We study 18 metazoans, from two distinct points of view: the human's and the fly's. Using the GOrilla gene ontology (GO) analysis tool, we explore functional enrichment of the ""universal proteins'', those with homologues in all 17 other species, and of the ""non-universal proteins''. A large number of GO terms are strongly enriched in both human and fly universal proteins. Most of these functions are known to be essential. A smaller number of GO terms, exhibiting markedly different properties, are enriched in both human and fly non-universal proteins. We further explore the non-universal proteins, whose conservation profiles are consistent with the ""tree of life'' (TOL consistent), as well as the TOL inconsistent proteins. Finally, we applied Quantum Clustering to the conservation profiles of the TOL consistent proteins. Each cluster is strongly associated with one or a small number of specific monophyletic clades in the tree of life. The proteins in many of these clusters exhibit strong functional enrichment associated with the ""life style'' of the related clades. Most previous approaches for studying function and conservation are ""bottom up'', studying protein families one by one, and separately assessing the conservation of each. By way of contrast, our approach is ""top down''. We globally partition the set of all proteins hierarchically, as described above, and then identify protein families enriched within different subdivisions. While supporting previous findings, our approach also provides a tool for discovering novel relations between protein conservation profiles, functionality, and evolutionary history as represented by the tree of life."

Inversions, however, are poorly characterized and more difficult to study, especially those mediated by inverted repeats or segmental duplications. Here, we describe the results of a simple and fast inverse PCR (iPCR) protocol for high-throughput genotyping of a wide variety of inversions using a small amount of DNA. In particular, we analyzed 22 inversions predicted in humans ranging from 5.1 kb to 226 kb and mediated by inverted repeat sequences of 1.6-24 kb. First, we validated 17 of the 22 inversions in a panel of nine HapMap individuals from different populations, and we genotyped them in 68 additional individuals of European origin, with correct genetic transmission in similar to 12 mother-father-child trios. Global inversion minor allele frequency varied between 1% and 49% and inversion genotypes were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. By analyzing the nucleotide variation and the haplotypes in these regions, we found that only four inversions have linked tag-SNPs and that in many cases there are multiple shared SNPs between standard and inverted chromosomes, suggesting an unexpected high degree of inversion recurrence during human evolution. iPCR was also used to check 16 of these inversions in four chimpanzees and two gorillas, and 10 showed both orientations either within or between species, providing additional support for their multiple origin. Finally, we have identified several inversions that include genes in the inverted or breakpoint regions, and at least one disrupts a potential coding gene. Thus, these results represent a significant advance in our understanding of inversion polymorphism in human populations and challenge the common view of a single origin of inversions, with important implications for inversion analysis in SNP-based studies."

Humans and Great Apes Cohabiting the Forest Ecosystem in Central African Republic Harbour the Same Hookworms,"['Hasegawa, H', 'Modry, D', 'Kitagawa, M', 'Shutt, KA', 'Todd, A', 'Kalousova, B', 'Profousova, I', 'Petrzelkova, KJ']",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,10.1371/journal.pntd.0002715,MAR 2014,8,"Background: Hookworms are important pathogens of humans. To date, Necator americanus is the sole, known species of the genus Necator infecting humans. In contrast, several Necator species have been described in African great apes and other primates. It has not yet been determined whether primate-originating Necator species are also parasitic in humans.

Methodology/Principal Findings: The infective larvae of Necator spp. were developed using modified Harada-Mori filter-paper cultures from faeces of humans and great apes inhabiting Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic. The first and second internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1 and ITS-2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA and partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene of mtDNA obtained from the hookworm larvae were sequenced and compared. Three sequence types (I-III) were recognized in the ITS region, and 34 cox1 haplotypes represented three phylogenetic groups (A-C). The combinations determined were I-A, II-B, II-C, III-B and III-C. Combination I-A, corresponding to N. americanus, was demonstrated in humans and western lowland gorillas; II-B and II-C were observed in humans, western lowland gorillas and chimpanzees; III-B and III-C were found only in humans. Pairwise nucleotide difference in the cox1 haplotypes between the groups was more than 8%, while the difference within each group was less than 2.1%.

Conclusions/Significance: The distinctness of ITS sequence variants and high number of pairwise nucleotide differences among cox1 variants indicate the possible presence of several species of Necator in both humans and great apes. We conclude that Necator hookworms are shared by humans and great apes co-habiting the same tropical forest ecosystems."
Retrospective Serology Study of Respiratory Virus Infections in Captive Great Apes,"['Buitendijk, H', 'Fagrouch, Z', 'Niphuis, H', 'Bogers, WM', 'Warren, KS', 'Verschoor, EJ']",VIRUSES-BASEL,10.3390/v6031442,MAR 2014,2,"Great apes are extremely sensitive to infections with human respiratory viruses. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed sera from captive chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans. More than 1000 sera (403 chimpanzee, 77 gorilla, and 535 orang-utan sera) were analyzed for antibodies to the human respiratory viruses RSV (respiratory syncytial virus, hMPV (human metapneumovirus), H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses, and influenza B virus. In all ape species high seroprevalences were found for RSV, hMPV, and influenza B virus. A high percentage of captive chimpanzees also showed evidence of influenza A H1N1 infections, and had low levels of H3N2 antibodies, while in sera from gorillas and orang-utans antibody levels to influenza A and B viruses were much lower or practically absent. Transmission of respiratory viruses was examined in longitudinal sera of young chimpanzees, and in chimpanzee sera taken during health checks. In young animals isolated cases of influenza infections were monitored, but evidence was found for single introductions followed by a rapid dissemination of RSV and hMPV within the group. Implementation of strict guidelines for handling and housing of nonhuman primates was shown to be an efficient method to reduce the introduction of respiratory infections in colonies of captive animals. RSV seroprevalence rates of chimpanzees remained high, probably due to circulating virus in the chimpanzee colony."
Human evolution and tears of the rotator cuff,"['Craik, JD', 'Mallina, R', 'Ramasamy, V', 'Little, NJ']",INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS,10.1007/s00264-013-2204-y,MAR 2014,3,"Purpose Humans differ from other great ape species in their propensity to develop tears of the rotator cuff. The aim of this study was to compare the anatomical risk factors for subacromial impingement and rotator cuff tears amongst the great apes and to determine which features may be accentuated in humans and therefore play a more significant role in disease aetiology.

Methods Orthogonal digital photographs of 22 human, 17 gorilla, 13 chimpanzee and 12 orangutan dry bone scapula specimens oriented in the glenoid plane were taken. Anatomical measurements were preformed using a calibrated digital image technique and the results scaled according to scapula vertebral border length.

Results Of the ten anatomical features associated with subacromial impingement and rotator cuff tears in humans, none were shown to be accentuated and significantly different to the other species studied. However the human supraspinatus fossa was shown to be significantly smaller.

Conclusions These results indicate that an alternative primary aetiological factor for rotator cuff tears must exist. A reduction in the size of the supraspinatus fossa in human scapulae suggests that structural insufficiency of the supraspinatus or a change in rotator cuff force vectors could play a role."
Geometric properties and comparative biomechanics of Homo floresiensis mandibles,"['Daegling, DJ', 'Patel, BA', 'Jungers, WL']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.01.001,MAR 2014,2,"The hypodigm of Homo floresiensis from the cave of Liang Bua on Flores Island in the archipelago of Indonesia includes two mandibles (LB1/2 and LB6/1). The morphology of their symphyses and corpora has been described as sharing similarities with both australopiths and early Homo despite their Late Pleistocene age. Although detailed morphological comparisons of these mandibles with those of modern and fossil hominin taxa have been made, a functional analysis in the context of masticatory biomechanics has yet to be performed.

Utilizing data on cortical bone geometry from computed tomography scans, we compare the mechanical attributes of the LB1 and LB6 mandibles with samples of modern Homo, Pan, Pongo, and Gorilla, as well as fossil samples of Paranthropus robustus, Australopithecus africanus and South African early Homo. Structural stiffness measures were derived from the geometric data to provide relative measures of mandibular corpus strength under hypothesized masticatory loading regimes. These mechanical variables were evaluated relative to bone area, mandibular length and estimates of body size to assess their functional affinities and to test the hypothesis that the Liang Bua mandibles can be described as scaled-down variants of either early hominins or modern humans.

Relative to modern hominoids, the H. floresiensis material appears to be relatively strong in terms of rigidity in torsion and transverse bending, but is relatively weak under parasagittal bending. Thus, they are 'robust' relative to modern humans (and comparable with australopiths) under some loads but not others. Neither LB1 nor LB6 can be described simply as 'miniaturized' versions of modern human jaws since mandible length is more or less equivalent in Homo sapiens and H. floresiensis. The mechanical attributes of the Liang Bua mandibles are consistent with previous inferences that masticatory loads were reduced relative to australopiths but remained elevated relative to modern Homo.

Sperm Form and Function in the Absence of Sperm Competition,"['van der Horst, G', 'Maree, L']",MOLECULAR REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT,10.1002/mrd.22277,MAR 2014,6,"Sperm competition is a post-copulatory, sexual selection force that, together with phylogeny and fertilization mode, has been regarded as one of the main factors explaining the diversity in sperm size across species. This universal sperm selection mechanism favors traits that enhance a male's fertilizing ability and paternity success. Surprisingly, however, sperm characteristics and semen quality in monogamous species, with low risk of sperm competition, have barely received any attention. In this review, we consider sperm competition and monogamy as two ends of the selective spectrum, and discuss its effect on sperm structure and function. We address the issue of a lack of sperm competition by comparing sperm traits of essentially monogamous speciestheir largely degenerative sperm features and high degree of polymorphisms could be norms for monogamous species. Further, the level of sperm competition in humans is discussed by comparing its mating strategy, relative testis size, and sperm traits to other primate species. In terms of sperm concentration, sperm swimming speed, and sperm morphology, humans seem to be closer aligned to the low-risk sperm competition situation in gorillas than to promiscuous chimpanzees.

Fatty Acids in Mountain Gorilla Diets: Implications for Primate Nutrition and Health,"['Reiner, WB', 'Petzinger, C', 'Power, ML', 'Hyeroba, D', 'Rothman, JM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22232,MAR 2014,5,"Little is known about the fatty acid composition of foods eaten by wild primates. A total of 18 staple foods that comprise 97% of the annual dietary intake of the mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei) were analyzed for fatty acid concentrations. Fruits and herbaceous leaves comprise the majority of the diet, with fruits generally having a higher mean percentage of fat (of dry matter; DM), as measured by ether extract (EE), than herbaceous leaves (13.0%+/- SD 13.0% vs. 2.3 +/- SD 0.8%). The mean daily EE intake by gorillas was 3.1% (DM). Fat provided approximate to 14% of the total dietary energy intake, and approximate to 22% of the dietary non-protein energy intake. Saturated fatty acids accounted for 32.4% of the total fatty acids in the diet, while monounsaturated fatty acids accounted for 12.5% and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) accounted for 54.6%. Both of the two essential PUFA, linoleic acid (LA, n-6) and -linolenic acid (ALA, n-3), were found in all of the 17 staple foods containing crude fat and were among the three most predominant fatty acids in the diet: LA (C18:2n-6) (30.3%), palmitic acid (C16:0) (23.9%), and ALA (C18:3n-3) (21.2%). Herbaceous leaves had higher concentrations of ALA, while fruit was higher in LA. Fruits provided high amounts of fatty acids, especially LA, in proportion to their intake due to the higher fat concentrations; despite being low in fat, herbaceous leaves provided sufficient ALA due to the high intake of these foods. As expected, we found that wild mountain gorillas consume a diet lower in EE, than modern humans. The ratio of LA:ALA was 1.44, closer to agricultural paleolithic diets than to modern human diets.

The influence of body posture on the kinematics of prehension in humans and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla),"['Reghem, E', 'Cheze, L', 'Coppens, Y', 'Pouydebat, E']",EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH,10.1007/s00221-013-3817-5,MAR 2014,0,"Much of our current understanding of human prehension in a comparative context is based on macaque models in a sitting, constrained body posture. In a previous study, we clearly showed differences in the amplitude of the forelimb joints between five primate species (lemur, capuchin, chimpanzee, gorilla and human) during unconstrained grasping where the animals were free to choose their body posture. One of our interrogations was to know if these differences could be due to the body posture. To address this question, this study compares humans with new data for gorillas during an unconstrained food prehension task in two body postures, a sitting and a quadrupedal one. The objective is to determine the behavioral and kinematic strategies (amplitudes and patterns of evolution of the articular angles) as well as differences and invariants of trunk and forelimb motions between species. The subjects were recorded by five cameras, and landmarks were digitized frame by frame to reconstruct 3D movement. Our results show that (1) despite significant influences of body postures on ranges of motion in gorillas and humans, species preserve their specific forelimb joint and trunk contribution; (2) body posture has a limited effect on the basic pattern of wrist velocity. Our study indicates that different primate species have specific kinematic features of limb coordination during prehension, which dose not alter with changes in posture. Therefore, across varying species, it is possible to compare limb kinematics irrespective of postural constraints and unconstrained condition need to be explored in other primates to understand the evolution of primate prehension."
Increased Substitution Rates Surrounding Low-Complexity Regions within Primate Proteins,"['Lenz, C', 'Haerty, W', 'Golding, GB']",GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/gbe/evu042,2014,0,"Previous studies have found that DNA-flanking low-complexity regions (LCRs) have an increased substitution rate. Here, the substitution rate was confirmed to increase in the vicinity of LCRs in several primate species, including humans. This effect was also found among human sequences from the 1000 Genomes Project. A strong correlation was found between average substitution rate per site and distance from the LCR, as well as the proportion of genes with gaps in the alignment at each site and distance from the LCR. Along with substitution rates, d(N)/d(S) ratios were also determined for each site, and the proportion of sites undergoing negative selection was found to have a negative relationship with distance from the LCR."
Ectocranial Suture Fusion in Primates: Pattern and Phylogeny,"['Cray, J', 'Cooper, GM', 'Mooney, MP', 'Siegel, MI']",JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY,10.1002/jmor.20218,MAR 2014,2,"Patterns of ectocranial suture fusion among Primates are subject to species-specific variation. In this study, we used Guttman Scaling to compare modal progression of ectocranial suture fusion among Hominidae (Homo, Pan, Gorilla, and Pongo), Hylobates, and Cercopithecidae (Macaca and Papio) groups. Our hypothesis is that suture fusion patterns should reflect their evolutionary relationship. For the lateral-anterior suture sites there appear to be three major patterns of fusion, one shared by Homo-Pan-Gorilla, anterior to posterior; one shared by Pongo and Hylobates, superior to inferior; and one shared by Cercopithecidae, posterior to anterior. For the vault suture pattern, the Hominidae groups reflect the known phylogeny. The data for Hylobates and Cercopithecidae groups is less clear. The vault suture site termination pattern of Papio is similar to that reported for Gorilla and Pongo. Thus, it may be that some suture sites are under larger genetic influence for patterns of fusion, while others are influenced by environmental/biomechanic influences. J. Morphol. 275:342-347, 2014.

We assessed the frequency of this fusion in 56 primate species (including apes, Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, and strepsirrhines) by using either magnetic resonance images or histological sections. A fusion between temporal cortex and posterior insula was present in 22 species (seven apes, two Old World monkeys, four New World monkeys, and nine strepsirrhines). The temporoinsular fusion was observed in most eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei and G. b. graueri) specimens (62% and 100% of cases, respectively) but was seen less frequently in other great apes and was never found in humans. We further explored the histology of this fusion in eastern gorillas by examining the cyto- and myeloarchitecture within this region and observed that the degree to which deep cortical layers and white matter are incorporated into the fusion varies among individuals within a species. We suggest that fusion between temporal and insular cortex is an example of a relatively rare neuroanatomical feature that has become more common in eastern gorillas, possibly as the result of a population bottleneck effect. Characterizing the phylogenetic distribution of this morphology highlights a derived feature of these great apes. J. Comp. Neurol. 522:844-860, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Kinship and Similarity in Residency Status Structure Female Social Networks in Black-and-White Colobus Monkeys (Colobus vellerosus),"['Wikberg, EC', 'Ting, N', 'Sicotte, P']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22435,MAR 2014,6,"Kinship shapes female social networks in many primate populations in which females remain in their natal group to breed. In contrast, it is unclear to which extent kinship affects the social networks in populations with female dispersal. Female Colobus vellerosus show routine facultative dispersal (i.e., some females remain philopatric and others disperse). This dispersal pattern allowed us to evaluate if facultative dispersed females form social networks shaped by an attraction to kin, to social partners with a high resource holding potential, or to similar social partners in terms of maturational stage, dominance rank, and residency status. During 2008 and 2009, we collected behavioral data via focal and ad libitum sampling of 61 females residing in eight groups at Boabeng-Fiema, Ghana. We determined kinship based on partial pedigrees and genotypes at 17 short tandem repeat loci. Kinship influenced coalition and affiliation networks in three groups consisting of long-term resident females with access to a relatively high number of female kin. In contrast, similar residency status was more important than kinship in structuring the affiliation network in one of two groups that contained recent female immigrants. In populations with female dispersal, the occurrence of kin structured social networks may not only depend on the kin composition of groups but also on how long the female kin have resided together. We found no consistent support for females biasing affiliation toward partners with high resource holding potential, possibly due to low levels of contest competition and small inter-individual differences in resource holding potential.

The spatial arrangement of the dots and the background color of the stimuli varied, and the size of the dots was manipulated to control for overall ratio of foreground to background. The subject's performance was not affected by these perceptual features, but was affected by the absolute difference and ratio between number of elements in the comparison stimuli. However, the relationship between these variables and his performance was not always linear as predicted by the analog magnitude model. In addition, the subject showed a high degree of transfer to novel numerosities up to ten, indicating that orangutans are capable of estimating quantity for a greater number of items than can presumably be subtilized by humans."
Reverse Zoonotic Disease Transmission (Zooanthroponosis): A Systematic Review of Seldom-Documented Human Biological Threats to Animals,"['Messenger, AM', 'Barnes, AN', 'Gray, GC', 'RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0089055,FEB 28 2014,11,"Background: Research regarding zoonotic diseases often focuses on infectious diseases animals have given to humans. However, an increasing number of reports indicate that humans are transmitting pathogens to animals. Recent examples include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, influenza A virus, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Ascaris lumbricoides. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of published literature regarding reverse zoonoses and highlight the need for future work in this area.

Methods: An initial broad literature review yielded 4763 titles, of which 4704 were excluded as not meeting inclusion criteria. After careful screening, 56 articles (from 56 countries over three decades) with documented human-to-animal disease transmission were included in this report.

Findings: In these publications, 21 (38%) pathogens studied were bacterial, 16 (29%) were viral, 12 (21%) were parasitic, and 7 (13%) were fungal, other, or involved multiple pathogens. Effected animals included wildlife (n = 28, 50%), livestock (n = 24, 43%), companion animals (n = 13, 23%), and various other animals or animals not explicitly mentioned (n = 2, 4%). Published reports of reverse zoonoses transmission occurred in every continent except Antarctica therefore indicating a worldwide disease threat.

Interpretation: As we see a global increase in industrial animal production, the rapid movement of humans and animals, and the habitats of humans and wild animals intertwining with great complexity, the future promises more opportunities for humans to cause reverse zoonoses. Scientific research must be conducted in this area to provide a richer understanding of emerging and reemerging disease threats. As a result, multidisciplinary approaches such as One Health will be needed to mitigate these problems."

The emergence of this protective allele is not understood because P. vivax is believed to have originated in Asia. Here we show, using a non-invasive approach, that wild chimpanzees and gorillas throughout central Africa are endemically infected with parasites that are closely related to human P. vivax. Sequence analyses reveal that ape parasites lack host specificity and are much more diverse than human parasites, which form a monophyletic lineage within the ape parasite radiation. These findings indicate that human P. vivax is of African origin and likely selected for the Duffy-negative mutation.

Tooth Cusp Sharpness as a Dietary Correlate in Great Apes,"['Berthaume, MA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22424,FEB 2014,1,"Mammalian molars have undergone heavy scrutiny to determine correlates between morphology and diet. Here, the relationship between one aspect of occlusal morphology, tooth cusp radius of curvature (RoC), and two broad dietary categories, folivory and frugivory, is analyzed in apes. The author hypothesizes that there is a relationship between tooth cusp RoC and diet, and that folivores have sharper teeth than frugivores, and further test the correlation between tooth cusp RoC and tooth cusp size. Eight measures of tooth cusp RoC (two RoCs per cusp) were taken from 53 M(2)s from four species and subspecies of frugivorous apes (Pongo pygmaeus, Pan troglodytes troglodytes, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, and Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and two subspecies of folivorous apes (Gorilla beringei beringei, and Gorilla beringei graueri). Phylogenetically corrected ANOVAs were run on the full dataset and several subsets of the full dataset, revealing that, when buccolingual RoCs are taken into account, tooth cusp RoCs can successfully differentiate folivores and frugivores. PCAs revealed that folivores consistently had duller teeth than frugivores. In addition, a weak, statistically significant positive correlation exists between tooth cusp size and tooth cusp RoC. The author hypothesizes differences in tooth cusp RoC are correlated with wear rates, where, per vertical unit of wear, duller cusps will have a longer length of exposed enamel ridge than sharper cusps. More data need to be gathered to determine if the correlation between tooth cusp RoC and tooth cusp size holds true when small primates are considered. Am J Phys Anthropol 153:226-235, 2014.

Non-invasive techniques have been used to assess the reproductive function of many primates and the importance of validating the measurements of hormones metabolites is widely recognized because they may vary even within closely related species. To determine if it is possible to non-invasively monitor ovarian activity in wild mountain gorillas, we used enzyme immunoassays (EIA) to quantify both urinary and fecal excretion of immunoreactive pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (iPdG), defined as all metabolites detected by a pregnanediol-3-glucuronide immunoassay (PdG EIA). Simultaneously, we performed the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to quantify the excretion of pregnanediol in urine and feces. Samples were analyzed over nine cycles of five females from the habituated gorillas monitored by Karisoke Research Center, Rwanda. As an additional indicator for ovulation timing, estrone conjugates (E1C) were measured in a subset of urine samples. The concentrations of iPdG and pregnanediol measured in the same samples were significantly correlated. Urinary concentrations of iPdG and pregnanediol fluctuated over the menstrual cycle but did not reveal any cyclic pattern, whereas a typical preovulatory urinary E1C surge and postovulatory increases of fecal iPdG and pregnanediol were detected. The luteal peaks of iPdG and pregnanediol levels in feces were on average 2.8 and 7.6 times higher, respectively, than averaged levels in the corresponding follicular phase. The relative number of days with observed matings was higher within the presumed fertile window than in the preceding period. Overall, the results indicate that fecal analysis of iPdG and pregnanediol is suitable for detecting ovulation in female mountain gorillas. Urinary measurements using both EIA and LC-MS appeared to be uninformative for monitoring ovarian activity in this primate. Am. J. Primatol. 76:180-191, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Younger apes and human children plan their moves in a maze task,"['Volter, CJ', 'Call, J']",COGNITION,10.1016/j.cognition.2013.10.007,FEB 2014,4,"Planning defined as the predetermination of a sequence of actions towards some goal is crucial for complex problem solving. To shed light on the evolution of executive functions, we investigated the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of planning. Therefore, we presented all four great apes species (N = 12) as well as 4- and 5-year-old human preschoolers (N = 24) with a vertical maze task. To gain a reward placed on the uppermost level of the maze, subjects had to move the reward to the bottom through open gaps situated at each level of the maze. In total, there were ten gaps located over three of the maze's levels, and free passage through these gaps could be flexibly blocked using multiple traps. Due to the decision tree design of the maze, the subjects had to plan their actions depending on the trap configuration up to two steps ahead to successfully retrieve the reward. We found that (1) our measure of planning was negatively correlated with age in nonhuman apes, (2) younger apes as well as 5-year-old children planned their moves up to two steps ahead whereas 4-year-olds were limited to plan one step ahead, and (3) similar performance but different underlying limitations between apes and children. Namely, while all species of nonhuman apes were limited by a lack of motor control, human children exhibited a shortage in shifting their attention across a sequence of subgoals.

Improved pan-specific MHC class I peptide-binding predictions using a novel representation of the MHC-binding cleft environment.,"['Carrasco Pro, S', 'Zimic, M', 'Nielsen, M']",Tissue antigens,10.1111/tan.12292,2014-Feb,0,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules play a key role in cell-mediated immune responses presenting bounded peptides for recognition by the immune system cells. Several in silico methods have been developed to predict the binding affinity of a given peptide to a specific MHC molecule. One of the current state-of-the-art methods for MHC class I is NetMHCpan, which has a core ingredient for the representation of the MHC class I molecule using a pseudo-sequence representation of the binding cleft amino acid environment. New and large MHC-peptide-binding data sets are constantly being made available, and also new structures of MHC class I molecules with a bound peptide have been published. In order to test if the NetMHCpan method can be improved by integrating this novel information, we created new pseudo-sequence definitions for the MHC-binding cleft environment from sequence and structural analyses of different MHC data sets including human leukocyte antigen (HLA), non-human primates (chimpanzee, macaque and gorilla) and other animal alleles (cattle, mouse and swine). From these constructs, we showed that by focusing on MHC sequence positions found to be polymorphic across the MHC molecules used to train the method, the NetMHCpan method achieved a significant increase in the predictive performance, in particular, of non-human MHCs. This study hence showed that an improved performance of MHC-binding methods can be achieved not only by the accumulation of more MHC-peptide-binding data but also by a refined definition of the MHC-binding environment including information from non-human species.   2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The visitor effect in petting zoo-housed animals: Aversive or enriching?,"['Farrand, A', 'Hosey, G', 'Buchanan-Smith, HM']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2013.11.012,FEB 2014,2,"Two studies were carried out on the effect of visitors on mixed-breed goats, llama, and Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs housed in a petting zoo display within a safari park. In the first study we investigated the effect of the presence and density of visitors on the animals' behaviour and in the second, the effect of animal grooming by the visitors. We hypothesised that the animals' behaviour would be negatively affected by presence of visitors compared to periods of their absence, but this hypothesis was not fully supported by the data. Goat and llama behaviour was unaffected by the presence of the public, while the pigs showed decreased inactivity and social behaviour, both affiliative and aggressive, when visitors were present.

All three study species exhibited increased levels of non-aggressive interaction with the public when visitor density was higher but the level of avoidance or aggression towards visitors was not dependent on density. The goats were less often in physical contact with other goats and less likely to be within proximity of a non-conspecific when visitor numbers were high, whereas the pigs showed decreased feeding, a behaviour that constituted a majority of their activity budget. Species differences were observed in the proportion of samples the study groups interacted in a non-aggressive manner with visitors, goats being most likely and llama the least likely to engage in this behaviour. In the second study visitors were provided with a grooming tool and asked to groom the animals, but no significant behavioural change was observed in either goats or pigs as a result. Visitors groomed goats, but not pigs, more than they interacted with them in non-grooming interactions, and goats, but not pigs, responded less to grooming as visitor density increased.

Although significant behavioural changes in all three study species were associated with either visitor presence or density, the low levels of avoidance of visitors, visitor-directed aggression, or animal-directed aggression, suggest the welfare of the study animals was not profoundly impacted by visitor-related stimuli. Furthermore, there was no evidence that grooming by the public was enriching for the animals. The species differences reported here do suggest, however, that Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs and llama are more sensitive to visitor pressure than goats and particular attention to their welfare may be necessary when they are housed in petting zoo displays.

Deictic Gesturing in Wild Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)? Some Possible Cases,"['Hobaiter, C', 'Leavens, DA', 'Byrne, RW']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0033757,FEB 2014,11,"Referential pointing is important in the development of language comprehension in the child and is often considered a uniquely human capacity. Nonhuman great apes do point in captivity, usually for a human audience, but this has been interpreted as an interaction pattern learned from human caretakers, not indicative of natural deictic ability. In contrast, spontaneous pointing for other apes is almost unknown among wild ape populations, supporting doubts as to whether apes naturally have any capacity to point referentially. Here the authors describe and illustrate 4 cases of gestures by juvenile chimpanzees in the Sonso chimpanzee community in Budongo, Uganda, that, at some level, may appear to he deictic and referential. The authors discuss the possible reasons why chimpanzees, if they possess a capacity for referential pointing, do not use it more frequently."

In this experiment, we tested for selective inattentional blindness to racial outgroup members. We reasoned that some racial groups would be perceived as more relevant than others, depending on the interpersonal goal that was active. White participants were primed with interpersonal goals that ranged from psychologically distant (searching for a coworker) to psychologically close (searching for a romantic partner). In the control condition, no goal was explicitly activated. Then, participants watched a video of 2 teams passing a ball and were asked to count the ball passes of one of the teams. In the middle of the video, a Caucasian or an African American man walked through the scene. Participants were then asked to report whether they had seen the interloper. Results revealed that as interpersonal goals became closer to the self, participants were less likely to see the African American man. This research demonstrates a new form of social exclusion based on early attention processes that may perpetuate racial bias."

Body Signals During Social Play in Free-Ranging Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta): A Systematic Analysis,"['Yanagi, A', 'Berman, CM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22219,FEB 2014,3,"Social play involves one of the most sophisticated types of communication, that is, the use of play signals. Most primate research on play signals has focused on the use of the play face. However, some species appear to exhibit a variety of play signals. For example, rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) have been reported to use body movements or postures that might have signal value during social play, in addition to the play face. However, it is not clear whether these body signals actually meet several criteria necessary to label them as play signals. Here we examine the forms and possible functions of seven candidate signals that we observed exclusively during social play contexts among free-ranging rhesus monkeys on Cayo Santiago. We aim to (1) distinguish them from actual play behavior (play involving contact or chasing) using loglinear analysis and (2) determine whether they predict playful behavior using modified PC-MC methods. Two candidate signals did not resemble any behaviors used in actual play. The other five signals contained elements that lasted longer or increased their conspicuousness over similar play behaviors, suggesting ritualized characteristics. Youngsters were likely to initiate contact or chasing play significantly sooner after candidate signals than in their absence. Thus, these candidate signals appear to meet critical criteria of signals that promote, moderate or facilitate play. As such, these findings open the door to questions about why multiple play signals have evolved. Am. J. Primatol. 76:168-179, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

However, few studies have examined the source and human-infective potential of enteric parasites in laboratory nonhuman primates. In the present work, 205 fecal specimens were collected from three groups of captive Macaca fascicularis kept in different densities in a laboratory animal facility in Guangxi, China, and examined by PCR for E. bieneusi, G. duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp., and Cyclospora spp. The infection rates of E. bieneusi and G. duodenalis were 11.3% and 1.2% in Group 1 (young animals kept individually; n = 168), 72.2% and 11.1% in Group 2 (young animals kept in groups; n = 18), and 31.6% and 53% in Group 3 (adults kept in groups; n = 19), respectively. Sequence analysis of PCR products showed the presence of five E. bieneusi genotypes, with genotype D (in 16/36 genotyped specimens) and a new genotype (in 15/36 genotyped specimens) as the dominant genotypes. All five E. bieneusi genotypes belonged to the zoonotic group (Group 1). The G. duodenalis genotypes (assemblages All and B) in five specimens and C. hominis subtype (IdA14) in one specimen were also known human-pathogens, although the Cyclospora seen in one animal appeared to be unique to macaque monkeys. The higher infection rate in younger animals reared in groups and common occurrence of zoonotic genotypes indicated that human-pathogenic E. bieneusi could be transmitted efficiently in captive nonhuman primates, and group-housing was a risk factor for transmission of zoonotic pathogens in young nonhuman primates in research facilities.

Peace-Making in Marsupials: The First Study in the Red-Necked Wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus),"['Cordoni, G', 'Norscia, I']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0086859,JAN 29 2014,2,"The issue of reconciliation has been widely investigated in many eutherian mammal species. Nevertheless, no data are available for marsupial mammals. Indeed, the majority of reports focus on group dynamics from an ecological and reproductive perspective, but no study has investigated them from a social point of view. We observed the red-necked wallaby colony (Macropus rufogriseus) hosted at the Tierparc Zoo Berlin (Germany) and collected data on aggressive and post-conflict interactions between group members. We found that the phenomenon of reconciliation is present in the study species (mean group CCT 27.40% +/-8.89% SE). Therefore, we demonstrated, for the first time, the occurrence of reconciliation in a gregarious marsupial mammal. Post-conflict reunion was not affected by the relationship quality between individuals (friendship or kinship) but it was fine-tuned according to the aggression intensity. For example, low intensity conflicts were reconciled whereas high intensity ones were not. Reconciliation reduced anxiety-related scratching in both of the former opponents and limited further attacks towards the victim during the post-conflict period. These findings suggest that the red-necked wallaby, like many eutherian species, can evaluate the costs of reconciliation and engage in peacemaking behavior in the right contexts, in order to maximize its pay-offs."

We report the largest screening for simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV-4) to date in a wide range of captive and wild non-human primate (NHP) species from Cameroon. Among the 681 wild and 426 captive NHPs examined, we detected STLV-4 infection only among gorillas by using HTLV-4-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The large number of samples analyzed, the diversity of NHP species examined, the geographic distribution of infected animals relative to the known HTLV-4 case, as well as detailed phylogenetic analyses on partial and full genomes, indicate that STLV-4 is endemic to gorillas, and that rather than being an ancient virus among humans, HTLV-4 emerged from a gorilla reservoir, likely through the hunting and butchering of wild gorillas. Our findings shed further light on the importance of gorillas as keystone reservoirs for the evolution and emergence of human infectious diseases and provide a clear course for preventing HTLV-4 emergence through management of human contact with wild gorillas, the development of improved assays for HTLV-4/STLV-4 detection and the ongoing monitoring of STLV-4 among gorillas and for HTLV-4 zoonosis among individuals exposed to gorilla populations."
Ardipithecus ramidus and the evolution of the human cranial base,"['Kimbel, WH', 'Suwa, G', 'Asfaw, B', 'Rak, Y', 'White, TD', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1322639111,JAN 21 2014,3,"The early Pliocene African hominoid Ardipithecus ramidus was diagnosed as a having a unique phylogenetic relationship with the Australopithecus + Homo clade based on nonhoning canine teeth, a foreshortened cranial base, and postcranial characters related to facultative bipedality. However, pedal and pelvic traits indicating substantial arboreality have raised arguments that this taxon may instead be an example of parallel evolution of human-like traits among apes around the time of the chimpanzee-human split. Here we investigated the basicranial morphology of Ar. ramidus for additional clues to its phylogenetic position with reference to African apes, humans, and Australopithecus. Besides a relatively anterior foramen magnum, humans differ from apes in the lateral shift of the carotid foramina, mediolateral abbreviation of the lateral tympanic, and a shortened, trapezoidal basioccipital element. These traits reflect a relative broadening of the central basicranium, a derived condition associated with changes in tympanic shape and the extent of its contact with the petrous. Ar. ramidus shares with Australopithecus each of these human-like modifications. We used the preserved morphology of ARA-VP 1/500 to estimate the missing basicranial length, drawing on consistent proportional relationships in apes and humans. Ar. ramidus is confirmed to have a relatively short basicranium, as in Australopithecus and Homo. Reorganization of the central cranial base is among the earliest morphological markers of the Ardipithecus + Australopithecus + Homo clade."
Multi-Modal Use of a Socially Directed Call in Bonobos,"['Genty, E', 'Clay, Z', 'Hobaiter, C', 'Zuberbuhler, K']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0084738,JAN 15 2014,8,"'Contest hoots' are acoustically complex vocalisations produced by adult and subadult male bonobos (Pan paniscus). These calls are often directed at specific individuals and regularly combined with gestures and other body signals. The aim of our study was to describe the multi-modal use of this call type and to clarify its communicative and social function. To this end, we observed two large groups of bonobos, which generated a sample of 585 communicative interactions initiated by 10 different males. We found that contest hooting, with or without other associated signals, was produced to challenge and provoke a social reaction in the targeted individual, usually agonistic chase. Interestingly, 'contest hoots' were sometimes also used during friendly play. In both contexts, males were highly selective in whom they targeted by preferentially choosing individuals of equal or higher social rank, suggesting that the calls functioned to assert social status. Multi-modal sequences were not more successful in eliciting reactions than contest hoots given alone, but we found a significant difference in the choice of associated gestures between playful and agonistic contexts. During friendly play, contest hoots were significantly more often combined with soft than rough gestures compared to agonistic challenges, while the calls' acoustic structure remained the same. We conclude that contest hoots indicate the signaller's intention to interact socially with important group members, while the gestures provide additional cues concerning the nature of the desired interaction."
Does Sympathy Motivate Prosocial Behaviour in Great Apes?,"['Liebal, K', 'Vaish, A', 'Haun, D', 'Tomasello, M']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0084299,JAN 8 2014,8,"Prosocial behaviours such as helping, comforting, or sharing are central to human social life. Because they emerge early in ontogeny, it has been proposed that humans are prosocial by nature and that from early on empathy and sympathy motivate such behaviours. The emerging question is whether humans share these abilities to feel with and for someone with our closest relatives, the great apes. Although several studies demonstrated that great apes help others, little is known about their underlying motivations. This study addresses this issue and investigates whether four species of great apes (Pongo pygmaeus, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus) help a conspecific more after observing the conspecific being harmed (a human experimenter steals the conspecific's food) compared to a condition where no harming occurred. Results showed that in regard to the occurrence of prosocial behaviours, only orangutans, but not the African great apes, help others when help is needed, contrasting prior findings on chimpanzees. However, with the exception of one population of orangutans that helped significantly more after a conspecific was harmed than when no harm occurred, prosocial behaviour in great apes was not motivated by concern for others."
Remembering in tool-use tasks in children and apes: The role of the information at encoding,"['Martin-Ordas, G', 'Atance, CM', 'Call, J']",MEMORY,10.1080/09658211.2013.806553,JAN 2 2014,2,"Providing adults with relevant information (knowledge that they will be tested at some future time) increases motivation to remember. Research has shown that it is more effective to have this information prior to, rather than after, an encoding phase. We investigated this effect in apes and children in the context of tool-use tasks. In Experiment 1 we presented chimpanzees, orangutans, and bonobos with two tool-use tasks and three different two-tool sets. We had two conditions: prospective (PP) and retrospective (RP). In the PP subjects were shown the task that they would have to solve before they were shown the tools with which they could solve it. In the RP this order was reversed. Apes remembered the location of the useful tool better in the PP than in the RP. In Experiment 2 we presented 3- and 4-year-olds with the same conditions. Both age groups remembered the location of the correct tool in the PP, but only the 4-year-olds did so in the RP. Thus providing apes and preschool children with relevant information prior to, rather than after, the encoding phase enhances memory. These results have important implications for the understanding of the evolution of memory in general, and encoding mechanisms in particular."
A Point-counterpoint Investigation of the Meaning of Civilization in Huxley's Brave New World,['ChooJaeuk'],Literature and Environment,NA,2014,0,"This paper aims to explore the meaning of 'civilization' often addressed in the Brave New World. It is not until one understands the writer's point-counterpoint narrative that the re/discovery of the civilization in the new world is fully made through a step-by-step approach to the text. Accordingly, the past and present historical meaning of the New Mexican Reservation should be first reviewed to know why Huxley foregrounds the reservation along with the brave new world in the text. Secondly, two episodes will be compared; the past historical episode that Gorillas were exhibited in London in 1861 and the present fictional one that John the Savage from New Mexico Reservation is experimented with as an ape in the zoo. Creating the point-counterpoint narrative quoting or using many of the historical or fictional characters in the novel, Huxley has implicitly led us to rediscover what the real civilization should be like in the future unlike that depicted in the dystopian novel. Huxley seems to suggest the attitudes that T. H. Huxley and Matthew Arnold should have had in their argument as to which one is superior to the other, science or culture/literature; T. H. Huxley should have more valued the culture and literature, and Matthew Arnold the science. In brief, Aldous Huxley argues those two should be integrated into the social and cultural society. Finally Huxley seems to say that it is only when both humanity and science are reciprocally respected that human society would prosper without losing the value of humanity even in the scientific world."

A baseline comparison across extant nonhuman primates reveals that they all depend on C-3 plants in forests, forest patches, and woodlands except during rare seasonal intake, in marginal regions, or where maize fields exist. Even large-bodied hominoids that could theoretically rely on hard-to-digest C-4 plants do not do so. Some Plio-Pleistocene hominins, however, apparently relied heavily on C-4 and/or CAM plants, which suggests that they relied extensively on cecal-colon microbial fermentation. Neanderthals seem less carnivorous than is often assumed when we compare their delta N-15(bone collagen) values with those of recent human populations, including recent human foragers who also fall at or near the top of their local trophic system. Finally, the introduction of maize into North America is shown to have been more sporadic and temporally variable than previously assumed."
On the Playing Areas of Children in The Snow Man and Gorilla: the Potential Space and the Intermediate Area,['이영준'],Modern Studies in English Language and Literature,NA,2014,0,"In this thesis, I will explore the significance of children’s playing areas. While young children are actively involved in their plays, the locations of their playing are changed from the potential space to the middle area according to the different periods of their ages. In The Snow Man, a young boy (no name is given) and in Gorilla, Hanna, a young girl, are in the different developmental stages whose age-differences expose their specific characteristics in terms of the types of playing areas. For the thesis, firstly I will explore the ‘second transitional object’ and ‘potential space’ on which the fantastic interplays of the young child with a snow man are acted out. Secondly, I will analyze the importance of the ‘intermediate area’ in which Hanna makes her intersubjective plays with Aldo, a rabbit doll. The intermediate  area is a special place of children’s playing; both the private inner world and the outer real world are interrelated."
A CT-image-based framework for the holistic analysis of cortical and trabecular bone morphology,"['Gross, T', 'Kivell, TL', 'Skinner, MM', 'Nguyen, NH', 'Pahr, DH', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS']",PALAEONTOLOGIA ELECTRONICA,NA,2014,0,"This study introduces a standardized framework for the holistic analysis of cortical and trabecular bone structure. This method, although applicable to all bones of the skeleton, is particularly useful for irregular-shaped or small bones for which the application of traditional methods has been especially challenging. Traditional analyses have quantified cortical or trabecular structure in only selected regions of a bone, such as single cross-sections of cortical bone or volumes of interest of trabecular structure in epiphyses. The proposed method improves on these traditional methods by visualizing and quantifying the internal bony structure throughout the entire bone and in user-defined anatomical subregions. Here, we describe and demonstrate the method using high-resolution microtomographic scans of a first metacarpal of an orangutan, gorilla, chimpanzee and human. Using automated morphological filters, the cortical bone is defined and extracted from the underlying trabecular structure to create two 3D models, one of the cortex and one of the trabecular bone that can be analysed separately. We test the sensitivity of the morphological parameters used to create these 3D models, demonstrating that the parameters defined here are robust and can provide accurate measures of cortical thickness, relative bone density, trabecular orientation, trabecular thickness and degree of anisotropy. This new, holistic method is able to reveal morphological and functional information about bone loading that is obscured or ignored using traditional methods, thus providing more informed interpretations of behaviour in extant and fossil taxa."

Given the importance of the hand in primate evolution, here we examine the evolution of the motor-hand area by comparing the relative size and pattern of cortical folding of the CS surface area from magnetic resonance images in 131 primates, including Old World monkeys, apes and humans. We found that humans and great apes have a well-formed motor-hand area that can be seen in the variation in depth of the CS along the dorsal-ventral plane. We further found that great apes have relatively large CS surface areas compared to Old World monkeys. However, relative to great apes, humans have a small motor-hand area in terms of both adjusted and absolute surface areas. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel"
Acoustic structure and variation in mountain and western gorilla close calls: a syntactic approach,"['Hedwig, D', 'Hammerschmidt, K', 'Mundry, R', 'Robbins, MM', 'Boesch, C']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/1568539X-00003175,2014,6,"Our understanding of the functioning of a species' vocal repertoire can be greatly improved by investigating acoustic variation and using objective classification schemes based on acoustic structure. Here we used a syntactic approach to investigate the acoustic structure of the gorilla close distance vocalizations ('close calls'), which remain as yet little understood. We examined 2130 calls of 10 mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) from Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, and 5 western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from Bai Hokou, Central African Republic. We segmented calls into units using distinct acoustic features and employed model-based cluster analyses to define the repertoire of unit types. We then examined how unit types were combined into calls. Lastly, we compared unit type use between age sex classes and the two study groups. We found that the gorilla close calls consist of 5 intergraded acoustic unit types which were flexibly but yet non-randomly concatenated into 159 combinations. Our results are in line with previous quantitative acoustic analyses demonstrating a high degree of acoustic variation in a variety of animal vocal repertoires, particularly close distance vocalizations. Our findings add on to (1) the recent argument that the common practice of describing vocal repertoires as either discrete or graded may be of little value as such distinctions may be driven by human perception and non-quantitative descriptions of vocal repertoires, and (2) recent studies indicating that flexibility in close range social calls can come about through combinatorial systems, which previously have been studied primarily in long distance vocalizations. Furthermore, our study highlights differences in the vocal repertoire of western and mountain gorillas, as expected given differences in environment and social behaviour. Our results offer opportunities for further in-depth studies investigating the function of the gorilla close calls, which will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of ape vocal communication in general."

Comparative organization of the claustrum: what does structure tell us about function?,"['Baizer, Joan S', 'Sherwood, Chet C', 'Noonan, Michael', 'Hof, Patrick R']",Frontiers in systems neuroscience,10.3389/fnsys.2014.00117,2014,5,"The claustrum is a subcortical nucleus present in all placental mammals. Many anatomical studies have shown that its inputs are predominantly from the cerebral cortex and its outputs are back to the cortex. This connectivity thus suggests that the claustrum serves to amplify or facilitate information processing in the cerebral cortex. The size and the complexity of the cerebral cortex varies dramatically across species. Some species have lissencephalic brains, with few cortical areas, while others have a greatly expanded cortex and many cortical areas. This evolutionary diversity in the cerebral cortex raises several questions about the claustrum. Does its volume expand in coordination with the expansion of cortex and does it acquire new functions related to the new cortical functions? Here we survey the organization of the claustrum in animals with large brains, including great apes and cetaceans. Our data suggest that the claustrum is not always a continuous structure. In monkeys and gorillas there are a few isolated islands of cells near the main body of the nucleus. In cetaceans, however, there are many isolated cell islands. These data suggest constraints on the possible function of the claustrum. Some authors propose that the claustrum has a more global role in perception or consciousness that requires intraclaustral integration of information. These theories postulate mechanisms like gap junctions between claustral cells or a ""syncytium"" to mediate intraclaustral processing. The presence of discontinuities in the structure of the claustrum, present but minimal in some primates, but dramatically clear in cetaceans, argues against the proposed mechanisms of intraclaustral processing of information. The best interpretation of function, then, is that each functional subdivision of the claustrum simply contributes to the function of its cortical partner."
Optimized Development of Sebaceous Fingermarks on Nonporous Substrates with Conformal Columnar Thin Films,"['Muhlberger, SA', 'Pulsifer, DP', 'Lakhtakia, A', 'Martin-Palma, RJ', 'Shaler, RC']",JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES,10.1111/1556-4029.12307,JAN 2014,5,"A form of physical vapor deposition, called the conformal-evaporated-film-by-rotation (CEFR) method, was optimized for the conformal deposition of columnar thin films (CTFs) on sebaceous fingermarks. Relying on the surface topology of the fingermark, the CTF development technique is different from traditional development techniques. After the optimization of the development conditions, the CTF development technique was found to be superior to traditional development methods on several nonporous substrates: the smooth side of Scotch (R) Multitask, Gorilla (R), and Scotch (R) Duct tapes; clear and black soft plastics; stained and sealed walnut and cherry woods; partial bloody fingermarks on stainless steel; and discharged cartridge casings. It was equally as good as other development techniques on other substrates, but worse on a few. The optimization study is expected to assist in designing a mobile CEFR apparatus capable of on-scene development of fingermarks."

Gorilla Tourism in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda: An Actor-Network Perspective","['van der Duim, R', 'Ampumuza, C', 'Ahebwa, WM']",SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES,10.1080/08941920.2014.901459,2014,0,"This article performs actor-network theory (ANT) to examine the development of gorilla tourism at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. We depict a number of translations in which gorillas were designated and enrolled as coexisting with local livelihood practices, as trophies in the hunting network, man's closest neighbor in the scientific network, endangered species in the conservation network, and finally, through habituation processes, became part of the tourism network. These five versions of the gorilla network show how gorillas are shaped in and by the relations in which they reside. By examining Bwindi in terms of ANT's notions of ordering, materiality, and multiplicity, we not only show how gorilla tourism has gained permanence and popularity, but also draw attention to new ways of thinking about actors and agency in tourism, conservation, and development."

Niche differentiation and dietary seasonality among sympatric gorillas and chimpanzees in Loango National Park (Gabon) revealed by stable isotope analysis,"['Oelze, VM', 'Head, JS', 'Robbins, MM', 'Richards, M', 'Boesch, C']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.Thevol.2013.10.003,JAN 2014,6,"The feeding ecology of sympatric great ape species yields valuable information for palaeodietary reconstructions in sympatric early hominin species. However, no isotopic references on sympatrically living apes and their feeding ecology are currently available. Here we present the first isotopic study on sympatric great apes, namely western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) from Loango National Park, Gabon. We successfully analyzed the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in a selection of food plants (n = 31) and hair samples (n = 30) retrieved from sleeping nests to test whether niche partitioning among sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas is detectable using isotope analysis of hair. Ape hair strands with roots were sectioned into sequential segments (n = 100) to investigate temporal isotopic variation related to seasonal variations in food resources. We found significant delta C-13 differences between herbaceous plants and fruits, most likely due to canopy effects. While the delta C-13 values of chimpanzees indicate the consumption of fruit, the low delta C-13 values in gorilla hair indicate folivory, most likely the consumption of C-13-depleted herbaceous vegetation. Our isotopic data also confirmed dietary overlap between chimpanzees and gorillas, which varied by season. Gorillas showed significant variation in delta C-13 values in response to season due to shifting proportions of herbaceous plants versus fruits. In chimpanzees, significant seasonal variation in delta N-15 was likely related to the seasonal availability of fruit species with particularly high delta N-15 values. In summary, we found isotopic evidence for niche partitioning and seasonal dietary variation among sympatric great apes at Loango. These findings provide a valuable reference for palaeodietary research on fossil hominins using delta C-13 analyses, Particularly for studies focusing on sympatric taxa and on temporal isotopic variation within incremental tissues such as tooth enamel.

Mountain gorillas face intense ecologic pressures due to their proximity to humans. Human communities outside the national parks, and numerous human activities within the national parks (including research, tourism, illegal hunting, and anti-poaching patrols), lead to a high degree of contact between mountain gorillas and wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. To assess the pathogen transmission potential between wildlife and livestock, feces of mountain gorillas, forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), and domestic cattle (Bos taurus) in Rwanda were examined for the parasites Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Giardia was found in 9% of mountain gorillas, 6% of cattle, and 2% of forest buffalo. Our study represents the first report of Giardia prevalence in forest buffalo. Cryptosporidium-like particles were also observed in all three species. Molecular characterization of Giardia isolates identified zoonotic genotype assemblage B in the gorilla samples and assemblage E in the cattle samples. Significant spatial clustering of Giardia-positive samples was observed in one sector of the park. Although we did not find evidence for transmission of protozoa from forest buffalo to mountain gorillas, the genotypes of Giardia samples isolated from gorillas have been reported in humans, suggesting that the importance of humans in this ecosystem should be more closely evaluated."
Plant selection for nest building by western lowland gorillas in Cameroon,"['Willie, J', 'Tagg, N', 'Petre, CA', 'Pereboom, Z', 'Lens, L']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-013-0363-5,JAN 2014,6,"We examined 834 nests built by western lowland gorillas in Cameroon between July 2008 and July 2011 to identify the plant species used in their construction. Preference for each plant species for nesting was assessed using a 'preference index' calculated by combining information on the occurrence of each species in the forest and in the nests. Forty-six plant species representing about 15 % of the total number of species in the forest and 26 % of species used for nest building were frequently used by gorillas. Preference levels significantly varied among these species. Nests were mostly built with herbs of the families Marantaceae and Zingiberaceae and woody species such as Manniophyton fulvum (liana) and Alchornea floribunda (shrub). As observed in other gorilla populations, suitability for nest building and availability of gorilla food in stems were the likely determinants of plant selection. The total number of species used per nest ranged from 1 to 11, with an average of 4.9. This is high compared to other sites, emphasizing variability in the availability of nest building materials and habitat differences across the range of the western gorilla. Seasonal changes in the use of different habitat types for nesting did not appear to influence plant use for nest building as there was little variation in plant selection across seasons or the composition of nests. Our findings suggest that gorillas non-randomly select plant species to build nests, and use a particular set of species combined at varying proportions, with no clear seasonal or spatial patterns."
Welfare based primate rehabilitation as a potential conservation strategy: does it measure up?,"['Guy, AJ', 'Curnoe, D', 'Banks, PB']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-013-0386-y,JAN 2014,1,"Many primate species are threatened with extinction and are the focus of extensive conservation efforts including re-introduction, captive breeding and habitat conservation. Welfare-based rehabilitation (hereafter also 'rehabilitation') is a management strategy commonly used for primates, particularly those species targeted by the pet and bush meat trades. Rehabilitation of rescued primates typically has the dual motivation of welfare and conservation, but has not been assessed as a conservation strategy. As the species involved in rehabilitation are often endangered (e.g. chimpanzees, gorillas, orang-utans), it is important for rehabilitation projects to follow a 'best practice' model in order to increase positive outcomes. In this study, we compared the approaches of 28 welfare-based primate rehabilitation projects to the 'IUCN guidelines for nonhuman primate re-introductions', in addition to components of the 'Best practice guidelines for the re-introduction of great apes' in order to assess where additional work might be needed for released animals to contribute to conservation outcomes. Few projects examined complied with the guidelines for re-introduction, failing to incorporate important factors such as quarantine, long term post-release monitoring and training for predator awareness. Further development of species-specific rehabilitation guidelines may improve the outcomes of future rehabilitation projects. To support this, we recommend that detailed methods and results be published for all rehabilitation efforts, regardless of the outcome."

However, extremely large and variable group size and growing evidence for affiliative relationships among males, make them a fascinating subject for studies of male-male tolerance and the evolution of large groups. During a 13-month study of free ranging Guianan bearded sakis (Chiropotes sagulatus) in continuous forest in Suriname, we documented variation in group size seasonally and social behaviour, particularly among males. We found that group size was smaller and more variable in the long dry season than the short wet season, perhaps in response to changes in resource availability. We found clear evidence of affiliative male-male relationships, with males being more social than females (89.2% of events involved one male versus 15.6% that involved one female) and typically socializing with other males (68.7% of events involved 2 or more males). We also found no evidence of hierarchical relationships between males (complete absence of agonistic interactions), and we documented unique male-affiliative behaviours and temporary all-male subgroups for the first time. To investigate potential explanations of male tolerance, we compared bearded saki social patterns to other multi-male group living primates (Ateline and Pan spp.). We found similarities with Brachyteles that suggest high intergroup mating competition and scramble competition for mates within groups."

The stated micromachining techniques are cutting and welding of transparent samples. In addition, cutting and drilling experiments were backed by theoretical modelling giving a deeper insight into the whole process. We demonstrate cut-out holes in soda-lime glass having thickness up to 1 mm and aspect ratios close to 20, moreover, the fabrication time is of the order of tens of seconds, in addition, grooves and holes were fabricated in hardened 1.1 mm thick glass (Corning Gorilla glass).

Sanctuaries play an obvious and vital role in the battle against the illegal trade in wildlife and provide opportunities for local people to learn about the importance of protecting habitat and laws governing wildlife trade. Given the multi-disciplinary role of sanctuaries, the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance provides mechanisms to exchange best practices and establishes links to other conservation partners. In April 2011, the managers of the 22 Pan African Sanctuary Alliance members were surveyed in order to collect detailed information on the conservation activities of each sanctuary. The majority of the 22 sanctuaries conducted both on- and off-site education activities, engaging more than 429,000 people in education activities per year. Sanctuaries reported that they provided employment for over 550 local community members across Africa, as well as resources for community education and infrastructure, with an economic impact over $3 million per year. Sanctuaries were also involved in activities that promote law enforcement and believed that the activities they supported have led to better protection of primate habitats. The results of the survey demonstrate that sanctuaries have moved towards supporting and implementing community development activities aimed at poverty reduction, while conducting conservation activities. While Pan African Sanctuary Alliance sanctuaries were initially established to provide care and housing for orphaned, confiscated and displaced primates, this paper demonstrates how sanctuaries have combined ex-situ with in-situ initiatives to support social, economic, and environmental progress in primate range countries in Africa."

Human diseases are of particular concern, and the costs and benefits of human presence in protected areas with apes are regularly debated. While numerous syndromes with fatal outcomes have recently been described, precise identification of pathogens remains difficult. These diagnostic difficulties are compounded by the fact that direct veterinary intervention on wild apes is quite rare. Here we present the unique case of a wild chimpanzee at Gombe National Park that was observed with a severe illness and was subsequently examined and treated in the field. Multiple specimens were collected and tested with the aim of identifying the pathogen responsible for the illness. Our findings represent the first extensive screening of a living wild chimpanzee, yet despite our efforts, the cause and source of illness remain unknown. Nevertheless, our findings represent valuable baseline data for the ape conservation community and for comparison with other recent findings. In addition, we present the case here to demonstrate the planning required and multiple types of expertise necessary to maximize the amount of data obtained from such a rare intervention, and to provide lessons learned for future studies."
Apes' Tracking of Objects and Collections,"['Cacchione, T', 'Hrubesch, C', 'Call, J']",SWISS JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY,10.1024/1421-0185/a000120,2014,0,"Recent research suggests that great apes are less vulnerable to cohesion violations than human infants are. In contrast to human infants, apes successfully track nonsolid substances or split solid objects through occlusion (Cacchione & Call, 2010a; Cacchione, Hrubesch, & Call, 2012, 2013). The present study aims to investigate whether the lower vulnerability of great apes to cohesion violations also manifests when they are tracking collections. While even very young human infants appreciate the continuous existence of solid bound objects, they fail to show similar intuitions when tracking collections of objects (Chiang & Wynn, 2000). In a manual search task inspired by recent infant research, we tested whether humans' closest relatives, the great apes, showed a similar contrast in their reasoning about single solid objects and objects within collections. The results suggest that, in contrast to human infants, great apes appreciate the continuous existence of objects within collections and successfully track them through occlusion. This confirms the view that great apes are generally less vulnerable to cohesion violations than human infants."

RH5-Basigin interaction plays a major role in the host tropism of Plasmodium falciparum,"['Wanaguru, M', 'Liu, WM', 'Hahn, BH', 'Rayner, JC', 'Wright, GJ']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1320771110,DEC 17 2013,25,"Plasmodium falciparum, the cause of almost all human malaria mortality, is a member of the Laverania subgenus which infects African great apes. Interestingly, Laverania parasites exhibit strict host specificity in their natural environment: P. reichenowi, P. billcollinsi, and P. gaboni infect only chimpanzees; P. praefalciparum, P. blacklocki, and P. adleri are restricted to gorillas, and P. falciparum is pandemic in humans. The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for these host restrictions are not understood, although the interaction between the parasite blood-stage invasion ligand EBA175 and the host erythrocyte receptor Glycophorin-A (GYPA) has been implicated previously. We reexamined the role of the EBA175-GYPA interaction in host tropism using recombinant proteins and biophysical assays and found that EBA175 orthologs from the chimpanzee-restricted parasites P. reichenowi and P. billcollinsi both bound to human GYPA with affinities similar to that of P. falciparum, suggesting that the EBA175-GYPA interaction is unlikely to be the sole determinant of Laverania host specificity. We next investigated the contribution of the recently discovered Reticulocyte-binding protein Homolog 5 (RH5)-Basigin (BSG) interaction in host-species selectivity and found that P. falciparum RH5 bound chimpanzee BSG with a significantly lower affinity than human BSG and did not bind gorilla BSG, mirroring the known host tropism of P. falciparum. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified residues in BSG that are responsible for the species specificity of PfRH5 binding. Consistent with the essential role of the PfRH5-BSG interaction in erythrocyte invasion, we conclude that species-specific differences in the BSG receptor provide a molecular explanation for the restriction of P. falciparum to its human host."
Alzheimer's Disease Pathology in the Neocortex and Hippocampus of the Western Lowland Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Perez, SE', 'Raghanti, MA', 'Hof, PR', 'Kramer, L', 'Ikonomovic, MD', 'Lacor, PN', 'Erwin, JM', 'Sherwood, CC', 'Mufson, EJ']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY,10.1002/cne.23428,DEC 15 2013,8,"The two major histopathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid beta protein (A) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). A pathology is a common feature in the aged nonhuman primate brain, whereas NFT are found almost exclusively in humans. Few studies have examined AD-related pathology in great apes, which are the closest phylogenetic relatives of humans. In the present study, we examined A and tau-like lesions in the neocortex and hippocampus of aged male and female western lowland gorillas using immunohistochemistry and histochemistry. Analysis revealed an age-related increase in A-immunoreactive plaques and vasculature in the gorilla brain. A plaques were more abundant in the neocortex and hippocampus of females, whereas A-positive blood vessels were more widespread in male gorillas. Plaques were also A40-, A42-, and A oligomer-immunoreactive, but only weakly thioflavine S- or 6-CN-PiB-positive in both sexes, indicative of the less fibrillar (diffuse) nature of A plaques in gorillas. Although phosphorylated neurofilament immunostaining revealed a few dystrophic neurites and neurons, choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive fibers were not dystrophic. Neurons stained for the tau marker Alz50 were found in the neocortex and hippocampus of gorillas at all ages. Occasional Alz50-, MC1-, and AT8-immunoreactive astrocyte and oligodendrocyte coiled bodies and neuritic clusters were seen in the neocortex and hippocampus of the oldest gorillas. This study demonstrates the spontaneous presence of both A plaques and tau-like lesions in the neocortex and hippocampus in old male and female western lowland gorillas, placing this species at relevance in the context of AD research.

Within the veterinary community, concern exists that certain anesthetic protocols may exacerbate or artificially induce signs of cardiac disease. Because of potential cardiovascular effects, medetomidine has generally been used cautiously in patients with cardiac disease. The combination of ketamine and medetomidine is frequently used by many institutions because of its reversibility. To date, no published studies have obtained physiologic or echocardiographic parameters comparing different anesthetic protocols. In this study, with the use of seven adult male gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) with and without cardiac disease, echocardiographic and indirect blood pressure data during three phases of an anesthetic protocol were collected. The initial echocardiographic study was completed with ketamine/ medetomidine alone (5- 7 mg/kg, i. m., and 0.05- 0.07 mg/kg, i. m., respectively); the second study was completed after the addition of sevoflurane inhalant anesthesia to this procedure; and the third study was completed after reversal of medetomidine by administration of atipamezole (5: 1 with the medetomidine dose given at induction). Without exception, ejection fractions were 15- 25% lower under anesthesia with medetomidine as compared to ejection fractions after administration of atipamezole. Indirect blood pressures were higher on ketamine/ medetomidine, lower with addition of sevoflurane, and considerably lower after administration of atipamezole."
"RESPIRATORY DISEASE IN MOUNTAIN GORILLAS (GORILLA BERINGEI BERINGEI) IN RWANDA, 1990-2010: OUTBREAKS, CLINICAL COURSE, AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT","['Spelman, LH', 'Gilardi, KVK', 'Lukasik-Braum, M', 'Kinani, JF', 'Nyirakaragire, E', 'Lowenstine, LJ', 'Cranfield, MR']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,DEC 2013,1,"Between 1990 and 2010, 18 outbreaks of respiratory disease occurred in Rwanda's wild human-habituated mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei). An outbreak was defined as clinically observable respiratory illness involving at least one third of all the gorillas in a family group (>30% morbidity) over the course of at least 7 days. Outbreaks lasted 2 wk to 4 mo and affected up to five different gorilla family groups, either concurrently or sequentially. An outbreak was considered over if no further clinical illness was observed in the same or another group for at least 1 mo. Clinical signs varied from nasal discharge, sneezing, and mild intermittent coughing (mild), to spasmodic coughing, lethargy, and partial anorexia (moderate), to dyspnea, tachypnea, respiratory distress, weakness, complete anorexia, and occasionally death (severe). Nearly every mountain gorilla group habituated for tourism or research in Rwanda experienced at least one outbreak, and they may be increasing in frequency. In the first 15 yr of the review period 1990-2005, there were nine outbreaks involving 16 gorilla groups; in the last 5 yr of the review period, 2006-2010, there were nine outbreaks involving 11 groups. Although most gorillas recovered without treatment, 41 veterinary procedures were required to medically manage 35 severely ill individuals. Given the rise of mountain gorilla ecotourism in Rwanda, the possibility that respiratory disease results from contact with infected humans is of great concern, and both the etiology and epidemiology of this problem are active areas of research. The observed clinical signs, response to antimicrobial therapy among the sickest individuals, and postmortem findings are most consistent with viral upper respiratory tract infections complicated in some cases by secondary bacterial infections. The current gorilla visitation rules have been designed to minimize the risk of disease transmission between humans and wild human-habituated great apes."
"UNUSUAL TURNER SYNDROME MOSAIC WITH A TRIPLE X CELL LINE (47, X/49, XXX) IN A WESTERN LOWLAND GORILLA (GORILLA GORILLA GORILLA)","['Bradford, CM', 'Tupa, L', 'Wiese, D', 'Hurley, TJ', 'Zimmerman, R']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,DEC 2013,0,"A 29-yr-old female western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) was evaluated for low fertility and a midterm abortion. Laboratory testing included karyotyping, which revealed an unusual mosaicism for Turner syndrome with Triple X (47, X/49, XXX). This appears to be the first report of Turner syndrome in a great ape. In humans, Turner syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 3,000 females, with half of those monosomic for the X chromosome. A small proportion is mosaic for a triple X cell line (3-4%). In humans, Turner syndrome is associated with characteristic phenotype including short stature, obesity, a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, webbing of the neck, and anteverted ears. This individual gorilla is significantly shorter in stature than conspecifics and is obese despite normal caloric intake. Individuals with Turner syndrome should also be screened for common health issues, including congenital heart defects, obesity, kidney abnormalities, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus. Animals with decreased fertility, multiple miscarriages, fetal losses, unusual phenotypes, or a combination of these symptoms should be evaluated for genetic abnormalities."
APPLYING CLINICALLY PROVEN HUMAN TECHNIQUES FOR CONTRACEPTION AND FERTILITY TO ENDANGERED SPECIES AND ZOO ANIMALS: A REVIEW,"['Silber, SJ', 'Barbey, N', 'Lenahan, K', 'Silber, DZ']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/1042-7260-44.4S.S111,DEC 2013,1,"Reversible contraception that does not alter natural behavior is a critical need for managing zoo populations. In addition to reversible contraception, other fertility techniques perfected in humans may be useful, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or oocyte and embryo banking for endangered species like amphibians and Mexican wolves (Canis lupus baileyi). Furthermore, the genetics of human fertility can give a better understanding of fertility in more exotic species. Collaborations were established to apply human fertility techniques to the captive population. Reversible vasectomy might be one solution for reversible contraception that does not alter behavior. Reversible approaches to vasectomy, avoiding secondary epididymal disruption, were attempted in South American bush dogs (Speothos venaticus), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), Przewalski's horse (Equus przewalski poliakov), and Sika deer (Cervus nippon) in a variety of zoos around the world. These techniques were first perfected in > 4,000 humans before attempting them in zoo animals. In vitro fertilization with gestational surrogacy was used to attempt to break the vicious cycle of hand rearing of purebred orangutans, and egg and ovary vitrification in humans have led to successful gamete banking for Mexican wolves and disappearing amphibians. The study of the human Y chromosome has even explained a mechanism of extinction related to global climate change. The best results with vasectomy reversal (normal sperm counts, pregnancy, and live offspring) were obtained when the original vasectomy was performed ""open-ended,"" so as to avoid pressure-induced epididymal disruption. The attempt at gestational surrogacy for orangutans failed because of severe male infertility and the lack of success with human ovarian hyperstimulation protocols. Vitrification of oocytes is already being employed for the Amphibian Ark Project and for Mexican wolves. Vasectomy can be a reversible contraception option in zoo animals, even in endangered species. Ongoing use of gamete and embryo freezing may salvage vanishing species."
Great Ape Skeletal Collections: Making the Most of Scarce and Irreplaceable Resources in the Digital Age,"['Gordon, AD', 'Marcus, E', 'Wood, B']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22391,DEC 2013,4,"Information about primate genomes has re-emphasized the importance of the great apes (Pan, Gorilla, and Pongo) as, for most purposes, the appropriate comparators when generating hypotheses about the most recent common ancestor of the hominins and panins, or the most recent common ancestor of the hominin clade. Great ape skeletal collections are thus an important and irreplaceable resource for researchers conducting these types of comparative analyses, yet the integrity of these collections is threatened by unnecessary use and their availability is threatened by financial pressures on the institutions in which the collections reside. We discuss the general history of great ape skeletal collections, and in order to get a better sense of the utility and potential of these important sources of data we assemble the equivalent of a biography of the Powell-Cotton Collection. We explore the history of how this collection of chimpanzee and gorilla skeletons was accumulated, how it came to be recognized as a potentially important source of comparative information, who has made use of it, and what types of data have been collected. We present a protocol for collecting information about each individual animal (e.g., which bones are preserved, their condition, etc.) and have made that information about the Powell-Cotton Collection freely available in an online relational database (Human Origins Database, www.humanoriginsdatabase.org). As an illustration of the practical application of these data, we developed a tabular summary of ontogenetic information about each individual (see Appendices A and B). Collections like the Powell-Cotton are irreplaceable sources of material regarding the hard-tissue evidence and recent history of the closest living relatives of modern humans. We end this contribution by suggesting ways that curators and the researchers who use and rely on these reference collections could work together to help preserve and protect them so that future generations can use and benefit from these priceless resources.

Sexual Dimorphism in Relative Sacral Breadth Among Catarrhine Primates,"['Moffett, EA', 'Maddux, SD', 'Ward, CV', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22372,DEC 2013,0,"As the sacrum contributes to the size and shape of the birth canal, the sexually dimorphic sacrum of humans is frequently interpreted within obstetric contexts. However, while the human sacrum has been extensively studied, comparatively little is known about sacral morphology in nonhuman primates. Thus, it remains unclear whether sacral sexual dimorphism exists in other primates, and whether potential dimorphism is primarily related to obstetrics or other factors such as body size dimorphism. In this study, sacra of Homo sapiens, Hylobates lar, Nasalis larvatus, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, Pan troglodytes, and Pan paniscus were evaluated for sexual dimorphism in relative sacral breadth (i.e., the ratio of overall sacral breadth to first sacral vertebral body breadth). Homo sapiens, H. lar, N. larvatus, and G. gorilla exhibit dimorphism in this ratio. Of these, the first three species have large cephalopelvic proportions, whereas G. gorilla has small cephalopelvic proportions. P. pygmaeus, P. troglodytes, and P. paniscus, which all have small cephalopelvic proportions, were not dimorphic for relative sacral breadth. We argue that among species with large cephalopelvic proportions, wide sacral alae in females facilitate birth by increasing the pelvic inlet's transverse diameter. However, given the small cephalopelvic proportions among gorillas, an obstetric basis for dimorphism in relative sacral breadth appears unlikely. This raises the possibility that sacral dimorphism in gorillas is attributable to selection for relatively narrow sacra in males rather than relatively broad sacra in females. Accordingly, these results have implications for interpreting pelvic dimorphism among fossil primates, including hominins. Am J Phys Anthropol 152:435-446, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Hominoid Humeral Morphology: 3D Morphometric Analysis,"['Holliday, TW', 'Friedl, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22385,DEC 2013,2,"Variation in humeral morphology among hominoids has long been recognized in relation to both phylogeny and behavior. Here, we use 3D landmark data to analyze humeral shape among hominoids, including hylobatids (n=37), Pongo (n=33), Homo (n=74), Pan (n=55), and Gorilla (n=45) to examine the relative influence of phylogenetic history vs. locomotor adaptation on humeral shape. Principal components analysis (PCA) of Procrustes shape data derived from 19 humeral type II or type III landmarks (Bookstein, 1991) for these taxa reveals the following: PC1, which primarily reflects the humeral torsion (or lack thereof) and relative diaphyseal and epiphyseal breadths, separates the relatively narrow-shafted, small articular dimensions and low humeral torsion Hylobates, and to a lesser extent, Pongo, humeri from those of the African hominoids. PC2, which largely contrasts shafts that are posteriorly convex (high PC2 scores) with antero-posteriorly straight humeral shafts (low PC2 scores) separates Homo, who tend to have A-P straighter shafts, from the more A-P bowed humeral shafts of the apes. These shape patterns suggest that the bowed shafts of Pan, Pongo, and Gorilla (and to a lesser extent, hylobatids) are due to the fact that in each of these taxa, the humerus is a weight-bearing bone, whereas the shafts of Homo are freed from locomotion. More subtle behavioral indicators are also elucidated, whereas cluster analyses (minimum spanning tree fit to a principal coordinates [PCO] plot and UPGMA dendrogram) reveal strong phylogenetic signals in the hominoid humerus as well.

Assessment of Landscape-Scale Distribution of Sympatric Great Apes in African Rainforests: Concurrent Use of Nest and Camera-Trap Surveys,"['Nakashima, Y', 'Iwata, Y', 'Ando, C', 'Nkoguee, CN', 'Inoue, E', 'Akomo, EFO', 'Nguema, PM', 'Bineni, TD', 'Banak, LN', 'Takenoshita, Y', 'Ngomanda, A', 'Yamagiwa, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22185,DEC 2013,5,"Information on the distribution and abundance of sympatric great apes (Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla) are important for effective conservation and management. Although much research has been done to improve the precision of nest-surveys, trade-offs between data-reliability and research-efficiency have not been solved. In this study, we used different approaches to assess the landscape-scale distribution patterns of great apes. We conducted a conventional nest survey and a camera-trap survey concurrently, and checked the consistency of the estimates. We divided the study area (ca. 500km(2)), containing various types of vegetation and topography, into thirty 16-km(2) grids (4kmx4km) and performed both methods along 2-km transects centered in each grid. We determined the nest creator species according to the definitions by Tutin & Fernandez [Tutin & Fernandez, 1984, Am J Primatol 6:313-336] and estimated nest-site densities of each species by using the conventional distance-sampling approach. We calculated the mean capture rate of 3 camera traps left for 3 months at each grid as the abundance index. Our analyses showed that both methods provided roughly consistent results for the distribution patterns of the species; chimpanzee groups (parties) were more abundant in the montane forest, and gorilla groups were relatively homogeneously distributed across vegetation types. The line-transect survey also showed that the number of nests per nest site did not vary among vegetation types for either species. These spatial patterns seemed to reflect the ecological and sociological features of each species. Although the consistent results may be largely dependent on site-specific conditions (e.g., high density of each species, distinct distribution pattern between the two species), conventional nest-surveys and a subsequent check of their consistency with independent estimates may be a reasonable approach to obtain certain information on the species distribution patterns. Further analytical improvement is necessary for camera-traps to be considered a stand-alone method. Am. J. Primatol. 75:1220-1230, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
New facets of keratin K77: interspecies variations of expression and different intracellular location in embryonic and adult skin of humans and mice,"['Langbein, L', 'Reichelt, J', 'Eckhart, L', 'Praetzel-Wunder, S', 'Kittstein, W', 'Gassler, N', 'Schweizer, J']",CELL AND TISSUE RESEARCH,10.1007/s00441-013-1716-5,DEC 2013,4,"The differential expression of keratins is central to the formation of various epithelia and their appendages. Structurally, the type II keratin K77 is closely related to K1, the prototypical type II keratin of the suprabasal epidermis. Here, we perform a developmental study on K77 expression in human and murine skin. In both species, K77 is expressed in the suprabasal fetal epidermis. While K77 appears after K1 in the human epidermis, the opposite is true for the murine tissue. This species-specific pattern of expression is also found in conventional and organotypic cultures of human and murine keratinocytes. Ultrastructure investigation shows that, in contrast to K77 intermediate filaments of mice, those of the human ortholog are not attached to desmosomes. After birth, K77 disappears without deleterious consequences from human epidermis while it is maintained in the adult mouse epidermis, where its presence has so far gone unnoticed. After targeted Krt1 gene deletion in mice, K77 is normally expressed but fails to functionally replace K1. Besides the epidermis, both human and mouse K77 are present in luminal duct cells of eccrine sweat glands. The demonstration of a K77 ortholog in platypus but not in non-mammalian vertebrates identifies K77 as an evolutionarily ancient component of the mammalian integument that has evolved different patterns of intracellular distribution and adult tissue expression in primates."

Thyroid Autoantibodies Are Rare in Nonhuman Great Apes and Hypothyroidism Cannot Be Attributed to Thyroid Autoimmunity,"['Aliesky, H', 'Courtney, CL', 'Rapoport, B', 'McLachlan, SM']",ENDOCRINOLOGY,10.1210/en.2013-1717,DEC 2013,2,"The great apes include, in addition to Homo, the genera Pongo (orangutans), Gorilla (gorillas), and Pan, the latter comprising two species, P. troglodytes (chimpanzees) and P. paniscus (bonobos). Adult-onset hypothyroidism was previously reported in 4 individual nonhuman great apes. However, there is scarce information on normal serum thyroid hormone levels and virtually no data for thyroid autoantibodies in these animals. Therefore, we examined thyroid hormone levels and TSH in all nonhuman great ape genera including adults, adolescents, and infants. Because hypothyroidism in humans is commonly the end result of thyroid autoimmunity, we also tested healthy and hypothyroid nonhuman great apes for antibodies to thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and the TSH receptor (TSHR). We established a thyroid hormone and TSH database in orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos (447 individuals). The most striking differences are the greatly reduced free-T-4 and free-T-3 levels in orangutans and gorillas vs chimpanzees and bonobos, and conversely, elevated TSH levels in gorillas vs Pan species. Antibodies to Tg and TPO were detected in only 2.6% of adult animals vs approximately 10% in humans. No animals with Tg, TPO, or TSHR antibodies exhibited thyroid dysfunction. Conversely, hypothyroid nonhuman great apes lacked thyroid autoantibodies. Moreover, thyroid histology in necropsy tissues was similar in euthyroid and hypothyroid individuals, and lymphocytic infiltration was absent in 2 hypothyroid animals. In conclusion, free T-4 and free T-3 are lower in orangutans and gorillas vs chimpanzees and bonobos, the closest living human relatives. Moreover, thyroid autoantibodies are rare and hypothyroidism is unrelated to thyroid autoimmunity in nonhuman great apes."
Different selective pressures shape the evolution of Toll-like receptors in human and African great ape populations,"['Quach, H', 'Wilson, D', 'Laval, G', 'Patin, E', 'Manry, J', 'Guibert, J', 'Barreiro, LB', 'Nerrienet, E', 'Verschoor, E', 'Gessain, A', 'Przeworski, M', 'Quintana-Murci, L']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/ddt335,DEC 1 2013,12,"The study of the genetic and selective landscape of immunity genes across primates can provide insight into the existing differences in susceptibility to infection observed between human and non-human primates. Here, we explored how selection has driven the evolution of a key family of innate immunity receptors, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), in African great ape species. We sequenced the 10 TLRs in various populations of chimpanzees and gorillas, and analysed these data jointly with a human data set. We found that purifying selection has been more pervasive in great apes than in humans. Furthermore, in chimpanzees and gorillas, purifying selection has targeted TLRs irrespectively of whether they are endosomal or cell surface, in contrast to humans where strong selective constraints are restricted to endosomal TLRs. These observations suggest important differences in the relative importance of TLR-mediated pathogen sensing, such as that of recognition of flagellated bacteria by TLR5, between humans and great apes. Lastly, we used a population genetics-phylogenetics method that jointly analyses polymorphism and divergence data to detect fine-scale variation in selection pressures at specific codons within TLR genes. We identified different codons at different TLRs as being under positive selection in each species, highlighting that functional variation at these genes has conferred a selective advantage in immunity to infection to specific primate species. Overall, this study showed that the degree of selection driving the evolution of TLRs has largely differed between human and non-human primates, increasing our knowledge on their respective biological contribution to host defence in the natural setting."
Ontogenetic changes in limb bone structural proportions in mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei berirtgei),"['Ruff, CB', 'Burgess, ML', 'Bromage, TG', 'Mudakikwa, A', 'McFarlin, SC']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.06.008,DEC 2013,8,"Behavioral studies indicate that adult mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) are the most terrestrial of all nonhuman hominoids, but that infant mountain gorillas are much more arboreal. Here we examine ontogenetic changes in diaphyseal strength and length of the femur, tibia, humerus, radius, and ulna in 30 Virunga mountain gorillas, including 18 immature specimens and 12 adults. Comparisons are also made with 14 adult western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), which are known to be more arboreal than adult mountain gorillas. Infant mountain gorillas have significantly stronger forelimbs relative to hind limbs than older juveniles and adults, but are nonsignificantly different from western lowland gorilla adults. The change in inter-limb strength proportions is abrupt at about two years of age, corresponding to the documented transition to committed terrestrial quadrupedalism in mountain gorillas. The one exception is the ulna, which shows a gradual increase in strength relative to the radius and other long bones during development, possibly corresponding to the gradual adoption of stereotypical fully pronated knuckle-walking in older juvenile gorillas. Inter-limb bone length proportions show a contrasting developmental pattern, with hind limb/forelimb length declining rapidly from birth to five months of age, and then showing no consistent change through adulthood. The very early change in length proportions, prior to significant independent locomotion, may be related to the need for relatively long forelimbs for climbing in a large-bodied hominoid. Virunga mountain gorilla older juveniles and adults have equal or longer forelimb relative to hind limb bones than western lowland adults. These findings indicate that both ontogenetically and among closely related species of Gorilla, long bone strength proportions better reflect actual locomotor behavior than bone length proportions.

"New evidence for diet and niche partitioning in Rudapithecus and Anapithecus from Rudabanya, Hungary","['Deane, AS', 'Nargolwalla, MC', 'Kordos, L', 'Begun, DR']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.08.003,DEC 2013,0,"Rudabanya is rare among Eurasian Miocene fossil primate localities in preserving both a hominid and pliopithecoid, and as such provides the unique opportunity to reconstruct the nature of sympatry and niche partitioning in these taxa. Rudapithecus and Anapithecus have similar locomotor and positional behavior and overlapping body mass ranges. While -prior analyses of molar occlusal anatomy and microwear identify Rudapithecus as a soft-object frugivore, reconstructing the dietary behavior of Anapithecus has been more problematic. This taxon has been interpreted to be more folivorous by some, and more frugivorous by others. Here, we use high-resolution polynomial curve fitting (HR-PCF) to quantify and evaluate the mesiodistal and cervico-incisal curvatures of the incisor crowns of Rudapithecus and Anapithecus to identify diet-specific morphological variation in these taxa. Results are consistent with the interpretation that Anapithecus and Rudapithecus were primarily frugivorous and had diets that included similar resource types. However, Anapithecus may have consumed greater amounts of foliage, similar to extant mixed folivore frugivores (i.e., Gorilla gorilla gorilla, Symphalangus syndactylus), while Rudapithecus generated elevated compressive loads in the incisor region consistent with a specialized role for the anterior dentition in food processing (i.e., removal of tough protective fruit pericarps). We interpret these findings in light of the paleoecology at Rudabanya and conclude that, if these taxa Were indeed sympatric, Anapithecus may have used additional leaf consumption as a seasonal fallback resource to avoid direct competition with Rudapithecus. Conversely, Rudapithecus may have relied on less preferred and harder fruiting resources as a seasonal fallback resource during periods of fruit scarcity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Proximal metatarsal articular surface shape and the evolution of a rigid lateral foot in hominins,"['Proctor, DJ', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.09.004,DEC 2013,6,"This study quantifies the proximal articular surface shape of metatarsal (MT) 4 and MT 5 using three-dimensional morphometrics. Humans and apes are compared to test whether they have significantly different shapes that are skeletal correlates to comparative lateral foot function. In addition, shod and unshod humans are compared to test for significant differences in surface shape. The MT 4 fossils OH 8, Stw 628, and AL 333-160, and the MT 5 fossils AL 333-13, AL 333-78, OH 8, and Stw 114/115 are compared with humans and apes to assess whether they bear greater similarities to humans, which would imply a relatively stable lateral foot, or to apes, which would imply a flexible foot with a midfoot break. Apes have a convex curved MT 4 surface, and humans have a flat surface. The MT 4 fossils show greater similarity to unshod humans, suggesting a stable lateral foot. Unshod humans have a relatively flatter MT 4 surface compared with shod humans. There is much overlap in MT 5 shape between humans and apes, with more similarity between humans and Gorilla. The fossil MT 5 surfaces are generally flat, most similar to humans and Gorilla. Because of the high degree of shape overlap between humans and apes, one must use caution in interpreting lateral foot function from the proximal MT 5 surface alone. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Possible origins and evolution of the hepatitis B virus (HBV),"['Locarnini, S', 'Littlejohn, M', 'Aziz, MN', 'Yuen, L']",SEMINARS IN CANCER BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.semcancer.2013.08.006,DEC 2013,15,"All members of the family Hepadnaviridae are primarily viruses which contain double-stranded DNA genomes that are replicated via reverse transcription of a pregenomic RNA template. There are two subgroups within this family: mammalian and avian. The avian member's include the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), heron hepatitis B virus, Ross goose hepatitis B virus, stork hepatitis B virus and the recently identified parrot hepatitis B virus. More recently, the detection of endogenous avian hepadnavirus DNA integrated into the genomes of zebra finches has revealed a deep evolutionary origin of hepadnaviruses that was not previously recognised, dating back over 40 million years ago. The non-primate mammalian members of the Hepadnaviridae include the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), the ground squirrel hepatitis virus and arctic squirrel virus, as well as the recently described bat hepatitis virus. The identification of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in higher primates such as chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbons that cluster with the human genotypes further implies a more complex origin of this virus. By studying the molecular epidemiology of HBV in indigenous and relict populations in Asia-Pacific we propose a model for the origin and evolution of HBV that involves multiple cross-species transmissions and subsequent recombination events on a background of genotype C HBV infection.

Evidence for Divergence in Populations of Bonobos (Pan paniscus) in the Lomami-Lualaba and Kasai-Sankuru Regions Based on Preliminary Analysis of Craniodental Variation,"['Pilbrow, V', 'Groves, C']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-013-9737-1,DEC 2013,0,"Historical climatic events and riverine barriers influence the distribution of primates. The River Congo exerts the most significant influence on primate distribution in equatorial Africa, but the extent to which the inner basin of the Congo provided a refuge against Plio-Pleistocene climatic fluctuation is poorly understood. In this study we use cranial and dental morphometrics to examine how riverine barriers affect population patterns in bonobos (Pan paniscus). Bonobos and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are sister species and share the distinction of being the closest evolutionary relatives of humans, yet comparatively little is known about bonobo morphological diversity. We selected 55 adult bonobo crania with well-preserved postcanine dentitions and divided them into regions separated by the rivers Lukenie, Kasai, Lomami, and Lualaba. We found good discrimination among these regions in cranial and dental metrics, but whereas the discriminant functions from cranial metrics were statistically significant, the discriminant functions from dental metrics were not. Mean classification accuracy was 89% for craniometrics, and ranged between 72% and 93% for dental metrics. On average 84-97% of phenetic variation was encountered within regions. Our results mirror molecular studies in suggesting that bonobos are characterized by a long-term stable demographic history allowing strong gene flow between regions and precluding drift and population differentiation. There are some indications that the bonobos from the Lomami-Lualaba and the Kasai-Sankuru regions are divergent, but modest sample sizes do not allow us to be conclusive. We would welcome the opportunity to work with field researchers to augment our sample sizes and reanalyze our data."
Feeding Ecology of Cross River Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla diehli) at Mawambi Hills: The Influence of Resource Seasonality,"['Etiendem, DN', 'Tagg, N']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-013-9739-z,DEC 2013,2,"Determining the composition of primate diet and identifying factors that affect food choice are important in understanding habitat requirements of primates and designing conservation plans. We studied the diet of Cross River gorillas (Gorilla gorilla diehli) in relation to availability of food resources, in a semideciduous lowland forest site (Mawambi Hills) in Cameroon, from November 2009 to September 2011. Based on 109 d of feeding trail data, 203 fecal samples, and 22 mo of phenological monitoring, we determined that gorillas consumed a total of 242 food items, including 240 plant items from 186 species and 55 taxonomic families. Mawambi gorillas diversified fruit consumption when fruit availability increased, and consumed more fibrous foods (pith, leaf, bark) during times of fruit scarcity, consistent with results of other gorilla studies. However, fruit availability was not related to rainfall, and the period of fruit scarcity was more pronounced at Mawambi than at other gorilla study sites, due to a single long dry season and extreme rainfall at the end of the rainy season that delayed fruit production and ripening. We found no relationship between the daily path length of the gorillas and fruit consumption. We found feeding habits of Mawambi gorillas to be notably similar to those of a population of Cross River gorillas at Afi Mountain, Nigeria, although subtle differences existed, possibly due to site-specific differences in forest composition and altitude. At both sites the liana Landolphia spp. was the single most important food species: the leaves are a staple and the fruits are consumed during periods of fruit scarcity. Snails and maggots were consumed but we observed no further faunivory. We suggest that tree leaves and lianas are important fallback food sources in the gorilla diet in seasonally dry forests."
Gorillas in the closet? Public and private actors in the enforcement of transnational private regulation,"['Verbruggen, P']",REGULATION & GOVERNANCE,10.1111/rego.12026,DEC 2013,3,"This paper examines to what extent the background presence of state regulatory capacity - at times referred to as the regulatory gorilla in the closet - is a necessary precondition for the effective enforcement of transnational private regulation. By drawing on regulatory regimes in the areas of advertising and food safety, it identifies conditions under which (the potential of) public regulatory intervention can bolster the capacity of private actors to enforce transnational private regulation. These involve the overlap between norms, objectives, and interests of public and private regulation; the institutional design of regulatory enforcement; compliance with due process standards; and information management and data sharing. The paper argues that while public intervention remains important for the effective enforcement of transnational private regulation, governmental actors - both national and international - should create the necessary preconditions to strengthen private regulatory enforcement, as it can also enhance their own regulatory capacity, in particular, in transnational contexts."
Significance of Grooming Behavior in Two Polygynous Groups of Western Black Crested Gibbons: Implications for Understanding Social Relationships Among Immigrant and Resident Group Members,"['Guan, ZH', 'Huang, B', 'Ning, WH', 'Ni, QY', 'Sun, GZ', 'Jiang, XL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22178,DEC 2013,4,"In primates, grooming is considered among the most common behaviors for maintaining social bonds; however, to date, few studies have examined grooming behavior in gibbon species in detail. We used both a 5-min interval scan method and social network analysis to study grooming in two groups of polygynous western black-crested gibbon (Nomascus concolor) in Wuliang Mountain, Central Yunnan, China. Individuals in both groups spent little time in social grooming (1.45% and 1.97% of active time). We compared the two groups' grooming networks and found that the group that maintained a more stable social unit had a more complex grooming network while the group with new immigrants had a grooming network characterized by fewer grooming pairs. Females in both groups played important roles in the grooming network. A newly immigrant female spent the most time grooming others and chose the resident adult female as her main adult grooming partner. Other females from both groups chose the adult male as their primary grooming partner (except their offspring). A sub-adult male who had resided in his natal group for 2 years after maturing into an adult also groomed more and was at the center of the network. This male finally replaced the breeding male in his group 3 years after our data collection period ended. We hypothesize that the immigrant female and the resident young adult male engaged in more extensive grooming interactions as a behavioral strategy to gain tolerance from long-term residents. Our results suggest that female gibbons in polygynous groups actively cooperate in maintaining social relationships rather than co-exist through tolerance or avoidance. Our observations indicate that grooming networks in crested gibbons reflect individual dynamics and partly support the social cohesion hypothesis for primate grooming. In this regard, we suggest that changes in gibbon grooming networks can be used to predict social change. Am. J. Primatol. 75:1165-1173, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Gorilla Mothers Also Matter! New Insights on Social Transmission in Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Captivity","['Luef, EM', 'Pike, S']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0079600,NOV 27 2013,0,"The present paper describes two distinct behaviors relating to food processing and communication that were observed in a community of five separately housed groups of lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in captivity during two study periods one decade apart: (1) a food processing technique to separate wheat from chaff, the so-called PUFF-BLOWING technique; and (2) a male display used to attract the attention of visitors, the so-called THROW-KISS-DISPLAY. We investigated (a) whether the behaviors were transmitted within the respective groups; and if yes, (b) their possible mode of transmission. Our results showed that only the food processing technique spread from three to twenty-one individuals during the ten-year period, whereas the communicative display died out completely. The main transmission mode of the PUFF-BLOWING technique was the mother-offspring dyad: offspring of PUFF-BLOWING mothers showed the behavior, while the offspring of non- PUFF-BLOWING mothers did not. These results strongly support the role mothers play in the acquisition of novel skills and vertical social transmission. Furthermore, they suggest that behaviors, which provide a direct benefit to individuals, have a high chance of social transmission while the loss of benefits can result in the extinction of behaviors."
"Preliminary Insights into the Impact of Dietary Starch on the Ciliate, Neobalantidium coli, in Captive Chimpanzees","['Schovancova, K', 'Pomajbikova, K', 'Prochazka, P', 'Modry, D', 'Bolechova, P', 'Petrzelkova, KJ']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0081374,NOV 25 2013,1,"Infections caused by the intestinal ciliate Neobalantidium coli are asymptomatic in most hosts. In humans and captive African great apes clinical infections occasionally occur, manifested mainly by dysentery; however, factors responsible for development of clinical balantidiasis have not been fully clarified. We studied the effect of dietary starch on the intensities of infection by N. coli in two groups of captive chimpanzees. Adult chimpanzees infected by N. coli from the Hodonin Zoo and from the Brno Zoo, Czech Republic, were fed with a high starch diet (HSD) (average 14.7% of starch) for 14 days, followed by a five-day transition period and subsequently with a period of low starch diet (LoSD) (average 0.1% of starch) for another 14 days. We collected fecal samples during the last seven days of HSD and LoSD and fixed them in 10% formalin. We quantified trophozoites of N. coli using the FLOTAC method. The numbers of N. coli trophozoites were higher during the HSD (mean +/- SD: 49.0 +/- 134.7) than during the LoSD (3.5 +/- 6.8). A generalized linear mixed-effects model revealed significantly lower numbers of the N. coli trophozoites in the feces during the LoSD period in comparison to the HSD period (treatment contrast LoSD vs. HSD: 2.7 +/- 0.06 (SE), z = 47.7; p<<0.001). We conclude that our data provide a first indication that starch-rich diet might be responsible for high intensities of infection of N. coli in captive individuals and might predispose them for clinically manifested balantidiasis. We discuss the potential nutritional modifications to host diets that can be implemented in part to control N. coli infections."
Analysis of western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) specific Alu repeats,"['McLain, AT', 'Carman, GW', 'Fullerton, ML', 'Beckstrom, TO', 'Gensler, W', 'Meyer, TJ', 'Faulk, C', 'Batzer, MA']",MOBILE DNA,10.1186/1759-8753-4-26,NOV 22 2013,0,"Background: Research into great ape genomes has revealed widely divergent activity levels over time for Alu elements. However, the diversity of this mobile element family in the genome of the western lowland gorilla has previously been uncharacterized. Alu elements are primate-specific short interspersed elements that have been used as phylogenetic and population genetic markers for more than two decades. Alu elements are present at high copy number in the genomes of all primates surveyed thus far. The AluY subfamily and its derivatives have been recognized as the evolutionarily youngest Alu subfamily in the Old World primate lineage.

Results: Here we use a combination of computational and wet-bench laboratory methods to assess and catalog AluY subfamily activity level and composition in the western lowland gorilla genome (gorGor3.1). A total of 1,075 independent AluY insertions were identified and computationally divided into 10 subfamilies, with the largest number of gorilla-specific elements assigned to the canonical AluY subfamily.

Conclusions: The retrotransposition activity level appears to be significantly lower than that seen in the human and chimpanzee lineages, while higher than that seen in orangutan genomes, indicative of differential Alu amplification in the western lowland gorilla lineage as compared to other Homininae."

Trabecular Bone Structure Correlates with Hand Posture and Use in Hominoids,"['Tsegai, ZJ', 'Kivell, TL', 'Gross, T', 'Nguyen, NH', 'Pahr, DH', 'Smaers, JB', 'Skinner, MM']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0078781,NOV 14 2013,12,"Bone is capable of adapting during life in response to stress. Therefore, variation in locomotor and manipulative behaviours across extant hominoids may be reflected in differences in trabecular bone structure. The hand is a promising region for trabecular analysis, as it is the direct contact between the individual and the environment and joint positions at peak loading vary amongst extant hominoids. Building upon traditional volume of interest-based analyses, we apply a whole-epiphysis analytical approach using high-resolution microtomographic scans of the hominoid third metacarpal to investigate whether trabecular structure reflects differences in hand posture and loading in knuckle-walking (Gorilla, Pan), suspensory (Pongo, Hylobates and Symphalangus) and manipulative (Homo) taxa. Additionally, a comparative phylogenetic method was used to analyse rates of evolutionary changes in trabecular parameters. Results demonstrate that trabecular bone volume distribution and regions of greatest stiffness (i.e., Young's modulus) correspond with predicted loading of the hand in each behavioural category. In suspensory and manipulative taxa, regions of high bone volume and greatest stiffness are concentrated on the palmar or distopalmar regions of the metacarpal head, whereas knuckle-walking taxa show greater bone volume and stiffness throughout the head, and particularly in the dorsal region; patterns that correspond with the highest predicted joint reaction forces. Trabecular structure in knuckle-walking taxa is characterised by high bone volume fraction and a high degree of anisotropy in contrast to the suspensory brachiators. Humans, in which the hand is used primarily for manipulation, have a low bone volume fraction and a variable degree of anisotropy. Finally, when trabecular parameters are mapped onto a molecular-based phylogeny, we show that the rates of change in trabecular structure vary across the hominoid clade. Our results support a link between inferred behaviour and trabecular structure in extant hominoids that can be informative for reconstructing behaviour in fossil primates."
Impact of Male Infanticide on the Social Structure of Mountain Gorillas,"['Robbins, AM', 'Gray, M', 'Basabose, A', 'Uwingeli, P', 'Mburanumwe, I', 'Kagoda, E', 'Robbins, MM']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0078256,NOV 6 2013,7,"Infanticide can be a major influence upon the social structure of species in which females maintain long-term associations with males. Previous studies have suggested that female mountain gorillas benefit from residing in multimale groups because infanticide occurs when one-male groups disintegrate after the dominant male dies. Here we measure the impact of infanticide on the reproductive success of female mountain gorillas, and we examine whether their dispersal patterns reflect a strategy to avoid infanticide. Using more than 40 years of data from up to 70% of the entire population, we found that only 1.7% of the infants that were born in the study had died from infanticide during group disintegrations. The rarity of such infanticide mainly reflects a low mortality rate of dominant males in one-male groups, and it does not dispel previous observations that infanticide occurs during group disintegrations. After including infanticide from causes other than group disintegrations, infanticide victims represented up to 5.5% of the offspring born during the study, and they accounted for up to 21% of infant mortality. The overall rates of infanticide were 2-3 times higher in one-male groups than multimale groups, but those differences were not statistically significant. Infant mortality, the length of interbirth intervals, and the age of first reproduction were not significantly different between one-male versus multimale groups, so we found no significant fitness benefits for females to prefer multimale groups. In addition, we found limited evidence that female dispersal patterns reflect a preference for multimale groups. If the strength of selection is modest for females to avoid group disintegrations, than any preference for multimale groups may be slow to evolve. Alternatively, variability in male strength might give some one-male groups a lower infanticide risk than some multimale groups, which could explain why both types of groups remain common."
Reassessing Manual Proportions in Australopithecus afarensis,"['Rolian, C', 'Gordon, AD']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22365,NOV 2013,11,"Previous analyses of hand morphology in Australopithecus afarensis have concluded that this taxon had modern human-like manual proportions, with relatively long thumbs and short fingers. These conclusions are based on the A.L.333 composite fossil assemblage from Hadar, Ethiopia, and are premised on the ability to assign phalanges to a single individual, and to the correct side and digit. Neither assignment is secure, however, given the taphonomy and sample composition at A.L.333. We use a resampling approach that includes the entire assemblage of complete hand elements at Hadar, and takes into account uncertainties in identifying phalanges by individual, side and digit number. This approach provides the most conservative estimates of manual proportions in Au. afarensis. We resampled hand long bone lengths in Au. afarensis and extant hominoids, and obtained confidence limits for distributions of manual proportions in the latter. Results confirm that intrinsic manual proportions in Au. afarensis are dissimilar to Pan and Pongo. However, manual proportions in Au. afarensis often fall at the upper end of the distribution in Gorilla, and very lower end in Homo, corresponding to disproportionately short thumbs and long medial digits in Homo. This suggests that manual proportions in Au. afarensis, particularly metacarpal proportions, were not as derived towards Homo as previously described, but rather are intermediate between gorillas and humans. Functionally, these results suggest Au. afarensis could not produce precision grips with the same efficiency as modern humans, which may in part account for the absence of lithic technology in this fossil taxon.

"Possible tool use in a mountain gorilla

At the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund's Karisoke Research Center in Volcanoes National Park (Rwanda), an adult female was observed using a bamboo culm as a ladder for her offspring. This is one of only a few documented cases of possible tool use in wild gorillas, although tool use behavior is commonly observed in captive gorillas. Although the behavior observed may have been incidental, the present report in combination with previous evidence (Breuer et al., 2005) suggests that tool use in gorillas occurs outside the context of food acquisition and may be directed at overcoming physical obstacles in complex rugged microhabitats such as bamboo forest and swamps.

Human-associated Staphylococcus aureus strains within great ape populations in Central Africa (Gabon),"['Nagel, M', 'Dischinger, J', 'Turck, M', 'Verrier, D', 'Oedenkoven, M', 'Ngoubangoye, B', 'Le Flohic, G', 'Drexler, JF', 'Bierbaum, G', 'Gonzalez, JP']",CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION,10.1111/1469-0691.12119,NOV 2013,2,"The risk of serious infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus is well-known. However, most studies regarding the distribution of (clinically relevant) S.aureus among humans and animals took place in the western hemisphere and only limited data are available from (Central) Africa. In this context, recent studies focused on S.aureus strains in humans and primates, but the question of whether humans and monkeys share related S.aureus strains or may interchange strains remained largely unsolved. In this study we aimed to evaluate the distribution and spread of human-like S.aureus strains among great apes living in captivity. Therefore, a primate facility at the International Centre for Medical Research of Franceville (Gabon) was screened. We detected among the primates a common human S.aureus strain, belonging to the spa-type t148. It was isolated from three different individuals of the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), of which one individual showed a large necrotizing wound. This animal died, most probably of a staphylococcal sepsis. Additionally, we discovered the t148 type among chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) that were settled in the immediate neighbourhood of the infected gorillas. A detailed analysis by pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed that the gorilla and chimpanzee isolates represented two closely related strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a human-associated S.aureus strain causing disease in great apes. The simultaneous detection in gorillas and chimpanzees indicated an interspecies transmission of this S.aureus strain. Our results recommend that protection of wild animals must not only be based on habitat conservation, but also on the assessment of the risk of contact with human pathogens."
RNA-DNA differences in human mitochondria restore ancestral form of 16S ribosomal RNA,"['Bar-Yaacov, D', 'Avital, G', 'Levin, L', 'Richards, AL', 'Hachen, N', 'Jaramillo, BR', 'Nekrutenko, A', 'Zarivach, R', 'Mishmar, D']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.161265.113,NOV 2013,4,"RNA transcripts are generally identical to the underlying DNA sequences. Nevertheless, RNA-DNA differences (RDDs) were found in the nuclear human genome and in plants and animals but not in human mitochondria. Here, by deep sequencing of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and RNA, we identified three RDD sites at mtDNA positions 295 (C-to-U), 13710 (A-to-U, A-to-G), and 2617 (A-to-U, A-to-G). Position 2617, within the 16S rRNA, harbored the most prevalent RDDs (>30% A-to-U and similar to 15% A-to-G of the reads in all tested samples). The 2617 RDDs appeared already at the precursor polycistrone mitochondrial transcript. By using traditional Sanger sequencing, we identified the A-to-U RDD in six different cell lines and representative primates (Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pigmaeus, and Macaca mulatta), suggesting conservation of the mechanism generating such RDD. Phylogenetic analysis of more than 1700 vertebrate mtDNA sequences supported a thymine as the primate ancestral allele at position 2617, suggesting that the 2617 RDD recapitulates the ancestral 16S rRNA. Modeling U or G (the RDDs) at position 2617 stabilized the large ribosomal subunit structure in contrast to destabilization by an A (the pre-RDDs). Hence, these mitochondrial RDDs are likely functional."
Endowment Effects in Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla),"['Drayton, LA', 'Brosnan, SF', 'Carrigan, J', 'Stoinski, TS']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0031902,NOV 2013,2,"Reports of endowment effects in nonhuman primates have received considerable attention in the comparative literature in recent years. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying these effects. Continuing to explore endowment effects across different species of primate may reveal subtle differences in behavior that can help formulate specific hypotheses about the relevant mechanisms and the social and ecological factors that have shaped them. In this study, we use a paradigm that has previously been used to test chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and orangutans (Pongo spp.) to explore whether western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) exhibit comparable endowment effects. We find that gorillas exhibit endowment effects when in possession of food, but not nonfood, items, and that they show a statistically stronger effect than chimpanzees but not orangutans. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that mechanisms for endowment effects in primates may be related to inhibitory control or risk aversion."
Vif Proteins from Diverse Primate Lentiviral Lineages Use the Same Binding Site in APOBEC3G,"['Letko, M', 'Silvestri, G', 'Hahn, BH', 'Bibollet-Ruche, F', 'Gokcumen, O', 'Simon, V', 'Ooms, M']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.01944-13,NOV 2013,8,"APOBEC3G (A3G) is a cytidine deaminase that restricts human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other lentiviruses. Most of these viruses encode a Vif protein that directly binds A3G and leads to its proteasomal degradation. Both Vif proteins of HIV-1 and African green monkey simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVagm) bind residue 128 of A3G. However, this position does not control the A3G degradation by Vif variants derived from HIV-2 and SIVmac, which both originated from SIV of sooty mangabey monkeys (SIVsmm), suggesting that the A3G binding site for Vif proteins of the SIVsmm/HIV-2 lineage differs from that of HIV-1. To map the SIVsmm Vif binding site of A3G, we performed immunoprecipitations of individual A3G domains, Vif/A3G degradation assays and a detailed mutational analysis of human A3G. We show that A3G residue 129, but not the adjacent position 128, confers susceptibility to degradation by SIVsmm Vif. An artificial A3G mutant, the P129D mutant, was resistant to degradation by diverse Vifs from HIV-1, HIV-2, SIVagm, and chimpanzee SIV (SIVcpz), suggesting a conserved lentiviral Vif binding site. Gorilla A3G naturally contains a glutamine (Q) at position 129, which makes its A3G resistant to Vifs from diverse lineages. We speculate that gorilla A3G serves as a barrier against SIVcpz strains. In summary, we show that Vif proteins from distinct lineages bind to the same A3G loop, which includes positions 128 and 129. The multiple adaptations within this loop among diverse primates underscore the importance of counteracting A3G in lentiviral evolution."

We developed a new 'paddle-box' task to test the ability of different ape species to plan an appropriate sequence of physical actions (rotating paddles) to retrieve a reward from a goal location. The task had an adjustable difficulty level and was not dependent on species-specific behaviours (e.g. complex tool use). We investigated the planning abilities of captive orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) using the paddle-box. In experiment 1, subjects had to rotate one or two paddles before rotating the paddle with the reward on. Subjects of both species performed poorly, though orangutans rotated more non-food paddles, which may be related to their greater exploratory tendencies and bolder temperament compared with bonobos. In experiment 2 subjects could always rotate the paddle with the reward on first and still succeed, and most subjects of both species performed appropriate sequences of up to three paddle rotations to retrieve the reward. Poor performance in experiment 1 may have been related to subjects' difficulty in inhibiting the prepotent response to act on the reward immediately. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Structured bimanual actions and hand transfers reveal population-level right-handedness in captive gorillas,"['Tabiowo, E', 'Forrester, GS']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.09.010,NOV 2013,2,"There is a common prevailing perception that humans possess a species-unique population-level right-hand bias that has evolutionary links with language. New theories suggest that an early evolutionary division of cognitive function gave rise to a left-hemisphere bias for behaviours underpinned by structured sequences of actions. However, studies of great ape handedness have generated inconsistent results and considerable debate. Additionally, the literature places a heavy focus on chimpanzees, revealing a paucity of handedness findings from other great ape species, and thus limiting the empirical evidence with which we can evaluate evolutionary theory. We observed handedness during spontaneous naturalistic bimanual actions in a captive, biological group of 13 western lowland gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla. Our results demonstrated a significant group-level right-handed bias for bimanual actions as well as for a novel measure of handedness: hand transfer. The two measures revealed similar patterns of handedness, such that a right-hand bias for the majority of individuals was found across both measures. Our findings suggest that human population-level right-handedness is a behavioural trait linked with left-hemisphere dominance for the processing of structured sequences of actions, and was inherited by a common ancestor of both humans and apes.

EVALUATING THE PROSPECTS OF BENEFIT SHARING SCHEMES IN PROTECTING MOUNTAIN GORILLAS IN CENTRAL AFRICA,"['Mukanjari, S', 'Bednar-Friedl, B', 'Muchapondwa, E', 'Zikhali, P']",NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING,10.1111/nrm.12010,NOV 2013,2,"Presently, the mountain gorilla in Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo is endangered mainly by poaching and habitat loss. This paper sets out to investigate the possible resolution of poaching involving the local community by using benefit sharing schemes with local communities. Using a bioeconomic model, the paper demonstrates that the current revenue sharing scheme yields suboptimal conservation outcomes. It is, however, shown that a performance-linked benefit sharing scheme in which the Park Agency makes payment to the local community based on the growth of the gorilla stock can achieve socially optimal conservation. This scheme renders poaching effort by the local community, and therefore poaching fines and antipoaching enforcement toward the local community unnecessary. Given the huge financial outlay requirements for the ideal benefit sharing scheme, the Park Agencies in central Africa could reap more financial benefits for use in conservation if they employ an oligopolistic pricing strategy for gorilla tourism."

Manual Laterality and Strategy Use for a Coordinated Bimanual Task Requiring Precise and Power Grip in Guenons and Mangabeys,"['Maille, A', 'Rossard, A', 'Blois-Heulin, C']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22169,NOV 2013,0,"Bimanual tasks have been repeatedly shown to elicit manual asymmetries supposed to reflect hemispheric specialization. And yet, a coordinated bimanual task, the BOX task, appears to be inefficient in detecting biases of hand preferences. The BOX task involves two sequential actions requiring a precise grip, lift the lid of a box and grasp a small item inside the box (while holding the lid). In the present study, we compared manual laterality exhibited for the classic bimanual BOX task and for a unimanual BOX task in 11 De Brazza's monkeys (Cercopithecus neglectus) and 19 red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus). In addition, we assessed strategy use for solving the bimanual BOX task. We found that left-hand use for grasping the item was higher in the BOX-bimanual task than in the BOX-unimanual task. We propose that this increase in left-hand use for grasping the item results from both a hemispheric specialization for lifting the lid and an advantage in using a skillful strategy. Indeed, we revealed (1) group-level right biases for lifting the lid and (2) a complete differentiation between the roles of the two hands in subjects showing a left-hand preference for grasping the item. Finally, the bimanual BOX task showed age differences in the two species, either in manual laterality for grasping the item or in strategy use. This study provides additional evidence that manual laterality might be sensitive to maturational factors and characteristics of the bimanual tasks such as the order and the features of sequential actions.

SFV actively replicate in the oral cavity and can be transmitted to humans through NHP bites, giving rise to a persistent infection. We aimed at studying the natural history of SFV infection in human. We have analyzed viral load and gene expression in 14 hunters from Cameroon previously shown to be infected with a gorilla SFV strain. Viral DNA could be detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) targeting the pol-in region, in most samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (7.1 +/- 6.0 SFV DNA copies/105 PBMCs) and saliva (2.4 +/- 4.3 SFV DNA copies/105 cells) derived from the hunters. However, quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT)-qPCR revealed the absence of SFV viral gene expression in both PBMCs and saliva, suggesting that SFV was latent in the human samples. Our study demonstrates that a latent infection can occur in humans and persist for years, both in PBMCs and saliva. Such a scenario may contribute to the putative lack of secondary human-to-human transmissions of SFV."
"Comparative Morphology of the Hominin and African Ape Hyoid Bone, a Possible Marker of the Evolution of Speech","['Steele, J', 'Clegg, M', 'Martelli, S']",HUMAN BIOLOGY,NA,OCT 2013,0,"This study examines the morphology of the hyoid in three closely related species, Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Gorilla gorilla. Differences and similarities between the hyoids of these species are characterized and used to interpret the morphology and affinities of the Dikika A. afarensis, Kebara 2 Neanderthal, and other fossil hominin hyoid bones.

Humans and African apes are found to have distinct hyoid morphologies. In humans the maximum width across the distal tips of the articulated greater horns is usually slightly greater than the maximum length (distal greater horn tip to most anterior point of the hyoid body in the midline). A different pattern is usually found in the African ape hyoids, which have much greater maximum lengths. In humans, the hyoid body is also much more anteroposteriorly shallow in proportion to its height and width, and this is true for all age classes.

The Dikika australopithecine hyoid body proportions are chimpanzee-like. A discriminant function analysis, using a larger subadult sample from the three extant species than that reported by Alemseged et al. (2006), confirms this finding. The Kebara hyoid dimensions (body alone, and articulated body and greater horns) are almost all within the observed range for human hyoids. Discriminant functions clearly distinguish human from African ape hyoids and classify the Kebara 2 hyoid as human (confirming the finding of Arensburg et al. 1989).

Our virtual dissection of a chimpanzee air sac system shows its subhyoid extension into the dorsal hyoid body. Following Alemseged et al. (2006), the expanded bulla characteristic of the African ape and australopithecine hyoid body is therefore interpreted as reflecting the presence of such a laryngeal air sac extension. Its absence in the human, Neanderthal, and H. heidelbergensis (Atapuerca SH) hyoids implicates the loss of the laryngeal air sacs as a derived Neanderthal and modern human trait, which evolved no later than the middle Pleistocene. If, as has been argued by de Boer (2012), the loss of the air sac helped to enhance perceptual discrimination of speech sounds, then this derived hyoid morphology can be added to the list of fossil markers of the capacity for speech."
"Variability in the Developmental Life History of the Genus Gorilla
","['Stoinski, TS', 'Perdue, B', 'Breuer, T', 'Hoff, MP']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22301,OCT 2013,5,"Life history is influenced by factors both intrinsic (e.g., body and relative brain size) and extrinsic (e.g., diet, environmental instability) to organisms. In this study, we examine the prediction that energetic risk influences the life history of gorillas. Recent comparisons suggest that the more frugivorous western lowland gorilla shows increased infant dependence, and thus a slower life history, than the primarily folivorous mountain gorilla to buffer against the risk of starvation during periods of food unpredictability. We further tested this hypothesis by incorporating additional life history data from wild western lowland gorillas and captive western lowland gorillas with the assumption that the latter live under ecological conditions of energetic risk that more closely resemble those of mountain gorillas and thus should show faster life histories than wild members of the species. Overall, we found captive western lowland and wild mountain gorillas to have faster developmental life histories than wild western lowland gorillas, weaning their infants approximately a year earlier and thus reducing interbirth intervals by a year. These results provide support that energetic risk plays an important role in determining gorilla life history. Unlike previous assertions, gorillas do not have substantially faster life histories, at least at the genus level, than other great apes. This calls for a re-evaluation of theories concerning comparative ape life history and evolution and highlights the need for data from additional populations that vary in energetic risk.

Ontogeny of the Hominoid Scapula: The Influence of Locomotion on Morphology,"['Green, DJ', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22353,OCT 2013,6,"Primate shoulder morphology has been linked with locomotor habits, oftentimes irrespective of phylogenetic heritage. Among hominoids, juvenile African apes are known to climb more frequently than adults, while orangutans and gibbons maintain an arboreal lifestyle throughout ontogeny. This study examined if these ontogenetic locomotor differences carry a morphological signal, which should be evident in the scapulae of chimpanzees and gorillas but absent in taxa that do not display ontogenetic behavioral shifts. The scapular morphology of five hominoid primates and one catarrhine outgroup was examined throughout ontogeny to evaluate if scapular traits linked with arboreal activities are modified in response to ontogenetic behavioral shifts away from climbing. Specifically, the following questions were addressed: 1) which scapular characteristics distinguish taxa with different locomotor habits; and 2) do these traits show associated changes during development in taxa known to modify their behavioral patterns? Several traits characterized suspensory taxa from nonsuspensory forms, such as cranially oriented glenohumeral joints, obliquely oriented scapular spines, relatively narrow infraspinous fossae, and inferolaterally expanded subscapularis fossae. The relative shape of the dorsal scapular fossae changed in Pan, Gorilla, and also Macaca in line with predictions based on reported ontogenetic changes in locomotor behavior. These morphological changes were mostly distinct from those seen in Pongo, Hylobates, and Homo and imply a unique developmental pattern, possibly related to ontogenetic locomotor shifts. Accordingly, features that sorted taxa by locomotor habits and changed in concert with ontogenetic behavioral patterns should be particularly useful for reconstructing the locomotor habits of fossil forms.

A Geometric Morphometric Analysis of the Medial Tibial Condyle of African Hominids,"['Sylvester, AD', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.22762,OCT 2013,3,"Although the hominid knee has been heavily scrutinized, shape variation of the medial tibial condyle has yet to be described. Humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas differ in the shape of their medial femoral condyles and in their capacity for external and internal rotation of the tibia relative to the femur. I hypothesize that these differences should be reflected in the shape of the medial tibial condyle of these hominids. Here I use geometric morphometric techniques to uncover shape differences between the medial tibial condyles of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Humans are distinguished from the other two species by having a much more oval-shaped medial tibial condyle, while those of chimpanzees and gorillas are more triangular in outline. Gorillas (especially males) are distinguished by having more concavely-curved condyles (mediolateral direction), which is interpreted as an effect of heavy loading through the medial compartment of the knee in conjunction with differences in the degree of arboreality.

Harmonic Radar Tagging for Tracking Movement of Nezara viridula (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae),"['Pilkay, GL', 'Reay-Jones, FPF', 'Greene, JK']",ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,10.1603/EN13095,OCT 2013,2,"Harmonic radar tagging was investigated as a method for monitoring the movement of the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Because adhesive toxicity and tag weight limit the use of this technology, initial efforts focused on selection of the optimal adhesive and design of harmonic radar tags to reduce impact on the movement of stink bugs. A design consisting of a 6-cm-long 0.10-mm-thick silver-plated copper monopole on the anode terminal of a three-contact Schottky barrier diode attached with Gorilla super glue provided a compromise between unimpaired movement and tracking range, adding an additional 8% to the weight of the stink bug while not significantly (P > 0.05) reducing walking or flying mobility in the laboratory. Recovery of tagged stink bugs in cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (L.), and fallow fields ranged from 10 to 75% after 24 h, whereas marked stink bugs were recovered at rates of 0-35% by using sweep net or drop cloth sampling. The distance dispersed in the field was not impacted (P > 0.05) by crop, tagged status, or gender of the insect. Future research should examine possible improvements to the harmonic radar transceiver and the wire antenna to decrease encumbrance."
Sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas harbor convergent gut microbial communities,"['Moeller, AH', 'Peeters, M', 'Ndjango, JB', 'Li, YY', 'Hahn, BH', 'Ochman, H']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.154773.113,OCT 2013,16,"The gut microbial communities within great apes have been shown to reflect the phylogenetic history of their hosts, indicating codiversification between great apes and their gut microbiota over evolutionary timescales. But because the great apes examined to date represent geographically isolated populations whose diets derive from different sources, it is unclear whether this pattern of codiversification has resulted from a long history of coadaptation between microbes and hosts (heritable factors) or from the ecological and geographic separation among host species (environmental factors). To evaluate the relative influences of heritable and environmental factors on the evolution of the great ape gut microbiota, we assayed the gut communities of sympatric and allopatric populations of chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas residing throughout equatorial Africa. Comparisons of these populations revealed that the gut communities of different host species can always be distinguished from one another but that the gut communities of sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas have converged in terms of community composition, sharing on average 53% more bacterial phylotypes than the gut communities of allopatric hosts. Host environment, independent of host genetics and evolutionary history, shaped the distribution of bacterial phylotypes across the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, the four most common phyla of gut bacteria. Moreover, the specific patterns of phylotype sharing among hosts suggest that chimpanzees living in sympatry with gorillas have acquired bacteria from gorillas. These results indicate that geographic isolation between host species has promoted the evolutionary differentiation of great ape gut bacterial communities."
The interplay between genome organization and nuclear architecture of primate evolutionary neo-centromeres,"['Lomiento, M', 'Grasser, F', 'Rocchi, M', 'Muller, S']",GENOMICS,10.1016/j.ygeno.2013.04.017,OCT 2013,0,"An Evolutionary Neo-Centromere (ENC) is a centromere that emerged in an ectopic region of a chromosome during evolution. It is thought that the old centromere must be inactivated because dicentric chromosomes are not viable. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether 3D arrangement in the interphase nucleus of the novel and old centromeric domains was affected by the repositioning event. The data we present here strongly indicate that the ENC phenomenon does not affect the 3D location of either novel or old centromeres. Very likely, other features, such as gene density, rather than the newly acquired or lost functions, define positioning in the nucleus. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Rotator cuff muscle function and its relation to scapular morphology in apes,"['Larson, SG', 'Stern, JT']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.07.010,OCT 2013,4,"It is widely held that many differences among primate species in scapular morphology can be functionally related to differing demands on the shoulder associated with particular locomotor habits. This perspective is largely based on broad scale studies, while more narrow comparisons of scapular form often fail to follow predictions based on inferred differences in shoulder function. For example, the ratio of supraspinous fossa/infraspinous fossa size in apes is commonly viewed as an indicator of the importance of overhead use of the forelimb, yet paradoxically, the African apes, the most terrestrial of the great apes, have higher scapular fossa ratios than the more suspensory orangutan. The recent discovery of several nearly complete early hominin scapular specimens, and their apparent morphological affinities to scapulae of orangutans and gorillas rather than chimpanzees, has led to renewed interest in the comparative analysis of human and extant ape scapular form. To facilitate the functional interpretation of differences in ape scapulae, particularly in regard to relative scapular fossa size, we used electromyography (EMG) to document the activity patterns in all four rotator cuff muscles in orangutans and gibbons, comparing the results with previously published data for chimpanzees.

The EMG results indicate that the distinctive contributions of each cuff muscle to locomotion are the same in the three ape species, failing to support inferences of differences in rotator cuff function based on relative scapular fossa size comparisons. It is also shown that relative scapular fossa size is not in fact a good predictor of either the relative masses or cross-sectional areas of the rotator cuff muscles in apes, and relative fossa size gives a false impression of the importance of individual cuff muscles to locomotor differences among apes. A possible explanation for the disparity between fossa and muscle size relates to the underappreciated role of the scapular spine in structural reinforcement of the blade. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using antibody E06, which binds the phosphocholine (PC) headgroup of OxPLs, Western and ELISA formats revealed that OxPLs were only present in apo(a) with an intact KIV10 LBS. Lipid extracts of purified human Lp(a) contained both E06- and nonE06-detectable OxPLs by tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Trypsin digestion of 17K r-apo(a) showed PC-containing OxPLs covalently bound to apo(a) fragments by LC-MS/MS that could be saponified by ammonium hydroxide. Interestingly, PC-containing OxPLs were also present in 17K r-apo(a) with Asp(57)-> Ala(57) substitution in KIV10 that lacked E06 immunoreactivity. In conclusion, E06- and nonE06-detectable OxPLs are present in the lipid phase of Lp(a) and covalently bound to apo(a). E06 immunoreactivity, reflecting pro-inflammatory OxPLs accessible to the immune system, is strongly influenced by KIV10 LBS and is unique to human apo(a), which may explain Lp(a)'s pro-atherogenic potential."

The functions of these behaviors and the mechanisms of acquisition and spread of these behaviors have been debated frequently. Prompted by animal caretaker reports that great apes [chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), and orangutans (Pongo abelii)] at Leipzig Zoo occasionally wash their food, we conducted a study of food washing behaviors that consisted of two parts. In the first part we assessed the current distribution of the behavior on the basis of caretaker reports. In the second (experimental) part, we provided subjects individually with a water basin and two types of food (apples and cereal) that was either clean or covered/mixed with sand. We found that subjects of all species (except gorillas) placed apples in the water before consumption, and that they did so more often when the apples were dirty than when they were clean. Several chimpanzees and orangutans also engaged in behaviors resembling wheat placer mining."
MicroRNA Expression Profiling of the Porcine Developing Hypothalamus and Pituitary Tissue,"['Zhang, LF', 'Cai, ZW', 'Wei, SJ', 'Zhou, HY', 'Zhou, HM', 'Jiang, XL', 'Xu, NY']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,10.3390/ijms141020326,OCT 2013,4,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNA molecules, play important roles in gene expressions at transcriptional and post-transcriptional stages in mammalian brain. So far, a growing number of porcine miRNAs and their function have been identified, but little is known regarding the porcine developing hypothalamus and pituitary. In the present study, Solexa sequencing analysis showed 14,129,397 yielded reads, 6,680,678 of which were related to 674 unique miRNAs. After a microarray assay, we detected 175 unique miRNAs in the hypothalamus, including 136 previously known miRNAs and 39 novel candidates, while a total of 140 miRNAs, including 104 known and 36 new candidate miRNAs, were discovered in pituitary. More importantly, 37 and 30 differentially expressed miRNAs from several developmental stages of hypothalamus and pituitary were revealed, respectively. The 37 differentially expressed miRNAs in hypothalamus represented 6 different expression patterns, while the 30 differentially expressed miRNAs in pituitary represented 7 different expression patterns. To clarify potential target genes and specific functions of these differentially expressed miRNAs in hypothalamus and pituitary, TargetScan and Gorilla prediction tools were then applied. The current functional analysis showed that the differentially expressed miRNAs in hypothalamus and pituitary shared many biological processes, with the main differences being found in tissue-specific processes including: CDP-diacylglycerol biosynthetic/metabolic process; phosphatidic acid biosynthetic/metabolic process; energy reserve metabolic process for hypothalamus; adult behavior; sterol transport/homeostasis; and cholesterol/reverse cholesterol transport for pituitary. Overall, this study identified miRNA profiles and differentially expressed miRNAs among various developmental stages in hypothalamus and pituitary and indicated miRNA profiles change with age and brain location, enhancing our knowledge about spatial and temporal expressions of miRNAs in the porcine developing brain."
Identification of Novel MicroRNAs in Primates by Using the Synteny Information and Small RNA Deep Sequencing Data,"['Yuan, ZD', 'Liu, HD', 'Nie, YM', 'Ding, SP', 'Yan, ML', 'Tan, SH', 'Jin, YC', 'Sun, X']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,10.3390/ijms141020820,OCT 2013,0,"Current technologies that are used for genome-wide microRNA (miRNA) prediction are mainly based on BLAST tool. They often produce a large number of false positives. Here, we describe an effective approach for identifying orthologous pre-miRNAs in several primates based on syntenic information. Some of them have been validated by small RNA high throughput sequencing data. This approach uses the synteny information and experimentally validated miRNAs of human, and incorporates currently available algorithms and tools to identify the pre-miRNAs in five other primates. First, we identified 929 potential pre-miRNAs in the marmoset in which miRNAs have not yet been reported. Then, we predicted the miRNAs in other primates, and we successfully re-identified most of the published miRNAs and found 721, 979, 650 and 639 new potential pre-miRNAs in chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and rhesus macaque, respectively. Furthermore, the miRNA transcriptome in the four primates have been re-analyzed and some novel predicted miRNAs have been supported by the small RNA sequencing data. Finally, we analyzed the potential functions of those validated miRNAs and explored the regulatory elements and transcription factors of some validated miRNA genes of interest. The results show that our approach can effectively identify novel miRNAs and some miRNAs that supported by small RNA sequencing data maybe play roles in the nervous system."
Use of RNAlater (R) as a preservation method for parasitic coprology studies in wild-living chimpanzees,"['Drakulovski, P', 'Locatelli, S', 'Butel, C', 'Pion, S', 'Krasteva, D', 'Mougdi-Pole, E', 'Delaporte, E', 'Peeters, M', 'Mallie, M']",EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/j.exppara.2013.07.002,OCT 2013,1,"We evaluated the use of an RNA stabilisation buffer, RNAlater (R) (Ambion, Austin, Texas), as a preservation medium for parasitic coprology analysis of faecal samples collected from chimpanzees living in the wild (Pan troglodytes troglodytes).

We identified and counted parasitic elements and assessed their shape, size and morphology in relation to the storage time of the samples. We found that parasite elements were identifiable in RNAlater (R) preserved samples after as many as 7 years, showing that RNAlater (R) could be an effective and reliable preservation medium for coprology. Thus, its use could be an interesting way to optimise sample collection for several types of studies (parasitology and bacteriology/virology) at once, especially considering the logistically challenging and time-consuming field campaigns needed to obtain these faecal samples.

Evolution of life history and behavior in Hominidae: Towards phylogenetic reconstruction of the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor,"['Duda, P', 'Zrzavy, J', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.07.009,OCT 2013,6,"The origin of the fundamental behavioral differences between humans and our closest living relatives is one of the central issues of evolutionary anthropology. The prominent, chimpanzee-based referential model of early hominin behavior has recently been challenged on the basis of broad multispecies comparisons and newly discovered fossil evidence. Here, we argue that while behavioral data on extant great apes are extremely relevant for reconstruction of ancestral behaviors, these behaviors should be reconstructed trait by trait using formal phylogenetic methods. Using the widely accepted hominoid phylogenetic tree, we perform a series of character optimization analyses using 65 selected life-history and behavioral characters for all extant hominid species. This analysis allows us to reconstruct the character states of the last common ancestors of Hominoidea, Hominidae, and the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor. Our analyses demonstrate that many fundamental behavioral and life-history attributes of hominids (including humans) are evidently ancient and likely inherited from the common ancestor of all hominids. However, numerous behaviors present in extant great apes represent their own terminal autapomorphies (both uniquely derived and homoplastic). Any evolutionary model that uses a single extant species to explain behavioral evolution of early hominins is therefore of limited use. In contrast, phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral states is able to provide a detailed suite of behavioral, ecological and life-history characters for each hypothetical ancestor. The living great apes therefore play an important role for the confident identification of the traits found in the chimpanzee human last common ancestor, some of which are likely to represent behaviors of the fossil hominins.

Patterns of Infection with Cryptosporidium sp and Giardia sp in Three Species of Free-Ranging Primates in the Peruvian Amazon,"['West, KA', 'Heymann, EW', 'Mueller, B', 'Gillespie, TR']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-013-9710-z,OCT 2013,0,"Recent evidence of pathogen transmission to humans from wild primates and a greater recognition of the risk of human pathogen transmission to free-ranging primates have raised awareness of the potential impact of zoonotic pathogen transmission on primate conservation and nonhuman primate and human health. Cryptosporidium and Giardia are zoonotic protozoan parasites transmitted via fecal-oral contamination or water that can cause gastritis or enteritis in human and nonhuman primates. From June 2002 to September 2003, we collected fecal samples noninvasively from two species of tamarins (Saguinus mystax and S. nigrifrons) and one species of titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus) at the Estacin Biolgica Quebrada Blanco in the Peruvian Amazon to determine the distribution and prevalence of these potential pathogens. We screened 140 fecal samples representing known individuals of each species for Cryptosporidium and Giardia using the Merifluor immunoflourescence assay to determine the prevalence and intensity of infection with these organisms. With the exception of two samples we collected during the same week from a juvenile male Saguinus mystax, all samples were negative for Cryptosporidium. None of the fecal samples were positive for Giardia. The low prevalence of infection we observed limited our ability to examine the effects of demographic and environmental variables on patterns of infection; however, the exceptionally low prevalence of Cryptosporidium suggests that it is not a current health threat to these primate populations. Although the origin of infection with Cryptosporidium in the juvenile male Saguinus mystax cannot be determined, its presence alerts us to the potential for cross-species transmission and highlights the need for more detailed research to improve our understanding of the distribution and diversity of potentially pathogenic protozoa in Neotropical primate populations."

Given the abundance and even distribution of leaves in forested habitats, folivorous primates generally spend less time feeding; more time resting; have shorter day ranges; and require smaller home ranges than frugivorous primates. To test the influence of frugivory on ranging behavior, we established the activity budget and home-range size and use in a highly frugivorous population of the Borneo-endemic colobine, Presbytis rubicunda, within Sabangau tropical peat-swamp forest, Central Kalimantan, and examined relationships between fruit availability and ranging patterns. We collected 6848 GPS locations and 10,702 instantaneous focal behavioral scans on a single group between January and December 2011. The group had the largest home-range size recorded in genus Presbytis (kernel density estimates: mean = 108.3 +/- SD 3.8 ha, N = 4 bandwidths). The annual activity budget comprised 48 +/- SD 4.0% resting; 29.3 +/- SD 3.9% feeding, 14.2 +/- SD 2.5% traveling, and 0.4 +/- SD 0.4% social behaviors. Mean monthly day-range length was the highest recorded for any folivorous primate (1645 +/- SD 220.5 m/d). No significant relationships existed between ranging variables and fruit availability, and ranging behaviors did not vary significantly across seasons, potentially owing to low fluctuations in fruit availability. Our results suggest that colobine monkeys maintain larger than average ranges when high-quality food resources are available. Their extensive range requirements imply that protecting large, contiguous tracts of habitat is crucial in future conservation planning for Presbytis rubicunda."

Because nonmetric dental characteristics are manifestations of genetic differences among groups, they vary among geographically distant members of the same species and subspecies. We use 28 nonmetric dental traits in the deciduous molars to compare genetically and geographically distinct groups of extant African apes (Gorilla and Pan). Previous researchers have studied these traits in the adult or juvenile teeth of great apes and humans, and we score our observations according to established standards for hominins. We observe marked differences in trait frequencies between Gorilla and Pan, Pan troglodytes and P. paniscus, and two P. troglodytes subspecies but we find no significant differences between geographically isolated groups within the subspecies. Trait frequencies differ from those found in previous studies that contained fewer individuals. We find that the deciduous molars show similar variation to adult premolars and molars within Pan and Gorilla. This suggests that the deciduous dentition of these and other apes may contain diagnostic traits that are not currently in use."
Hediger Revisited: How Do Zoo Animals See Us?,"['Hosey, G']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,10.1080/10888705.2013.827916,OCT 1 2013,8,"Contact with people, both familiar (e.g., caretakers) and unfamiliar (e.g., members of the public), is a significant part of the lives of nonhuman animals in zoos. The available empirical evidence shows that in many cases this contact represents a source of stress to the animals, although there is sufficient overall ambiguity in these studies to suggest that the effect of people on the animals is much more complex than this. A possible way to try to understand human-animal relationships in the zoo is to ask how the animals might perceive the humans with whom they have contact, and here this question is explored further, using a framework first published by Hediger as a starting point. Hediger suggested that zoo animals might perceive people as an enemy, as part of the inanimate environment, or as a member of the same species. He supported these categories with anecdotal evidence, which was all that was available at the time, but more empirical evidence is available now, so it is appropriate to revisit these categories. The evidence suggests that animals discriminate both conspecific and heterospecific others, rather than just viewing familiar people as members of their own species, and that additional categories (stimulating part of the environment and friendship) may be warranted. These categories are then placed in a general model that suggests how relationships of different qualities, and hence different perceptions of each other, might develop between animals and the people they are in contact with in zoos."

Western Gorilla Vocal Repertoire and Contextual Use of Vocalizations,"['Salmi, R', 'Hammerschmidt, K', 'Doran-Sheehy, DM']",ETHOLOGY,10.1111/eth.12122,OCT 2013,9,"Despite considerable interest in the vocal communication of non-human primates and its possible relevance to theories of language evolution, we know surprisingly little about how vocal communication varies between closely related species inhabiting differing environments. Here, we provide the first quantitative description of the vocal repertoire, calling rates, and call usage in wild western gorillas and compare it to the previous work on mountain gorilla vocal behavior. During 1572h of focal follows (n=533), we collected behavioral data on and recorded vocalizations (n=2163) of eight individuals in one group at Mondika Research Center (Republic of Congo). We supplemented these data with opportunistic recordings of an additional adult male in a second group. We used discriminant function analysis to test how well calls can be categorized by their acoustic structure and used behavioral data to determine the typical usage of western gorilla call types. The vocal repertoire comprised of 17 call types. Twelve of 17 call types were given primarily in a single context. Our results were similar to previous studies of mountain gorillas in that grunts, and grumbles were used most frequently and the silverback male vocalized more frequently than other group members. However, compared to mountain gorillas, western gorillas used an additional call type (sex-whinny), used a second call type (hoot series) in a completely different context and by all age-sex classes, and used many more call types in a more context-specific fashion. Our study suggests that although vocal production is highly constrained by morphology and phylogeny, differing social and ecological conditions can yield differences in the use and function of calls, even between two closely related species such as western and mountain gorillas."
"Frequency of different human mollicutes species in the mucosa of the oropharynx, conjunctiva, and genitalia of free-ranging and captive capuchin monkeys (Cebus spp.)","['Neto, RL', 'Marques, LM', 'Guimaraes, AMS', 'Yamaguti, M', 'Oliveira, RC', 'Gaetti-Jardim, E', 'Medina, AO', 'Sanfilippo, LF', 'Timenetsky, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22164,OCT 2013,0,"This study is the first to evaluate the occurrence of several Mollicutes species in Brazilian capuchin monkeys (Cebus spp.). Mollicutes were detected by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in samples of the oropharyngeal, conjuctiva, and genital mucosae of 58 monkeys. In the oropharynx, Mollicutes in general (generic PCR to the Class), and those of the genus Ureaplasma (genus PCR), were detected in 72.4% and 43.0% of the samples, respectively. The identified species in this site included: Mycoplasma arginini (43.1%), M. salivarium (41.4%), and M. pneumoniae (19.0%). Both Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma are genera of the order Mycoplasmatales. In the preputial/vaginal mucosa, PCR detected Mollicutes in general in 27.58% of the samples, the genus Ureaplasma in 32.7%, the species M. arginini in 8.6%, and Acholeplasma laidlawii of the order Acholeplasmatales in 1.7% In the conjunctiva, Mollicutes in general were detected in 29.3% of the samples, with 1.7% being identified as A. laidlawii. Culturing was difficult due to contamination, but two isolates were successfully obtained. The Mollicutes species of this study provided new insights into these bacteria in Brazilian Cebus. Studies are lacking of the actual risk of Mollicutes infection or the frequency at which primates serve as permanent or temporary reservoirs for Mollicutes. In the present study, the samples were collected from monkeys without clinical signs of infection. The mere presence of Mollicutes, particularly those also found in humans, nevertheless signals a need for studies to evaluate the impact of these microorganisms on the health of non-human primates (NHPs) and the possibility of cross-species transmission between NHPs and humans.

Chimpanzee nesting patterns in savanna habitat: Environmental influences and preferences,"['Hernandez-Aguilar, RA', 'Moore, J', 'Stanford, CB']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22163,OCT 2013,8,"Data on chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) nesting patterns were collected in Issa, Ugalla, western Tanzania. Ugalla is one of the driest, most open, and seasonal habitats inhabited by chimpanzees. We investigated the physical characteristics of nests and trees used for nesting to understand environmental influences on nest building and identify the characteristics preferred by the chimpanzees and the basis for such preferences. We analyzed 2,167 nests and 1,523 nesting trees. Most nests were built in the middle section of the tree crown and close to the tree trunk, and used a single tree in construction. Some physical characteristics of nests (e.g., distance from tree trunk) seemed to be the result of constraints imposed by tree structure. Issa chimpanzees preferred tall trees with high first branches for nesting supporting the hypothesis that elevated height of a sleeping place is a predator defense strategy. The height from the ground to the first branch showed less variation than either tree height or crown height and correlated weakly with tree height, suggesting that height from the ground to the first branch may be a more important factor than tree height alone in selecting a tree in which to nest. As in other study sites, the chimpanzees used tree species in proportions that did not correspond to their abundance suggesting tree species preference. We report for the first time that chimpanzees directionally oriented their nests and propose that this may be to maximize sunlight. We compare our data to those of other chimpanzee study sites. Am.

Priority Areas for Large Mammal Conservation in Equatorial Guinea,"['Murai, M', 'Ruffler, H', 'Berlemont, A', 'Campbell, G', 'Esono, F', 'Agbor, A', 'Mbomio, D', 'Ebana, A', 'Nze, A', 'Kuhl, HS']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0075024,SEP 27 2013,6,"Hunting is one of the main driving forces behind large mammal density distribution in many regions of the world. In tropical Africa, urban demand for bushmeat has been shown to dominate over subsistence hunting and its impact often overrides spatial-ecological species characteristics. To effectively protect remaining mammal populations the main factors that influence their distribution need to be integrated into conservation area prioritisation and management plans. This information has been lacking for Rio Muni, Equatorial Guinea, as prior studies have been outdated or have not systematically covered the continental region of the country. In this study we evaluated: 1) the relative importance of local vs. commercial hunting; 2) wildlife density of protected vs. non-protected areas; and 3) the importance of ecological factors vs. human influence in driving mammal density distribution in Rio Muni. We adopted a systematic countrywide line transect approach with particular focus on apes and elephants, but also including other mammal species. For analysis of field data we used generalised linear models with a set of predictor variables representing ecological conditions, anthropogenic pressure and protected areas. We estimate that there are currently 884 (437-1,789) elephants and 11,097 (8,719-13,592) chimpanzees and gorillas remaining in Rio Muni. The results indicate strong hunting pressures on both local and commercial levels, with roads demonstrating a negative impact on elephants and overall mammal body mass. Protected areas played no role in determining any of the mammal species distributions and significant human hunting signs were found inside these protected areas, illustrating the lack of environmental law enforcement throughout the country. Rio Muni is currently under-represented in conservation efforts in Western Equatorial Africa, and we recommend a focus on cross-boundary conservation, in particular in the Monte Alen-Monts de Cristal and Rio Campo Ma'an conservation landscapes, where the highest densities and diversity of large mammals remain."
Close association between paralogous multiple isomiRs and paralogous/orthologues miRNA sequences implicates dominant sequence selection across various animal species,"['Guo, L', 'Zhao, Y', 'Zhang, H', 'Yang, S', 'Chen, F']",GENE,10.1016/j.gene.2013.06.083,SEP 25 2013,9,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial negative regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Next-generation sequencing technologies have identified a series of miRNA variants (named isomiRs). In this study, paralogous isomiR assemblies (from the miRNA locus) were systematically analyzed based on data acquired from deep sequencing data sets. Evolutionary analysis of paralogous (members in miRNA gene family in a specific species) and orthologues (across different animal species) miRNAs was also performed. The sequence diversity of paralogous isomiRs was found to be similar to the diversity of paralogous and orthologues miRNAs. Additionally, both isomiRs and paralogous/orthologues miRNAs were implicated in 5' and 3' ends (especially 3' ends), nucleotide substitutions, and insertions and deletions. Generally, multiple isomiRs can be produced from a single miRNA locus, but most of them had lower enrichment levels, and only several dominant isomiR sequences were detected. These dominant isomiR groups were always stable, and one of them would be selected as the most abundant miRNA sequence in specific animal species. Some isomiRs might be consistent to miRNA sequences in some species but not the other. Homologous miRNAs were often detected in similar isomiR repertoires, and showed similar expression patterns, while dominant isomiRs showed complex evolutionary patterns from miRNA sequences across the animal kingdom. These results indicate that the phenomenon of multiple isomiRs is not a random event, but rather the result of evolutionary pressures. The existence of multiple isomiRs enables different species to express advantageous sequences in different environments. Thus, dominant sequences emerge in response to functional and evolutionary pressures, allowing an organism to adapt to complex intra- and extra-cellular events. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Matching based on biological categories in Orangutans (Pongo abelii) and a Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Vonk, J']",PEERJ,10.7717/peerj.158,SEP 10 2013,3,"Following a series of experiments in which six orangutans and one gorilla discriminated photographs of different animal species in a two-choice touch screen procedure, Vonk & MacDonald (2002) and Vonk & MacDonald (2004) concluded that orangutans, but not the gorilla, seemed to learn intermediate level category discriminations, such as primates versus non-primates, more rapidly than they learned concrete level discriminations, such as orangutans versus humans. In the current experiments, four of the same orangutans and the gorilla were presented with delayed matching-to-sample tasks in which they were rewarded for matching photos of different members of the same primate species; golden lion tamarins, Japanese macaques, and proboscis monkeys, or family; gibbons, lemurs (Experiment 1), and subsequently for matching photos of different species within the following classes: birds, reptiles, insects, mammals, and fish (Experiment 2). Members of both Great Ape species were rapidly able to match the photos at levels above chance. Orangutans matched images from both category levels spontaneously whereas the gorilla showed effects of learning to match intermediate level categories. The results show that biological knowledge is not necessary to form natural categories at both concrete and intermediate levels."
Manual Pressure Distribution Patterns of Knuckle-Walking Apes,"['Matarazzo, S']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22325,SEP 2013,1,"Differences in how the hands of gorillas and chimpanzees contact the ground while knuckle walking have been noted but generally not quantified. It is widely believed that gorillas maintain a pronated arm and contact the ground with digits 2-5 consistently, while chimpanzees have variable arm position and digit contact. To further test these generalizations, distribution of pressure across the manus, peak digital pressures, and hand position were quantified using a pressure mat in eight captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and seven gorillas (Gorilla gorilla). Chimpanzees and gorillas make initial ground contact with the ulnar aspect of the hand and pressure moves radially. They differ in which digit usually makes final contact and receives maximum pressure, and hand position during contact. Gorillas regularly use a palm-back hand position and touch-off with digit 2. They show less variation in pressure application across the digits. Chimpanzees are more variable in hand position and pressure application. In both, hand position plays a key role in determining which digit acts as the final touch-off element. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Monkeys perform as well as apes and humans in a size discrimination task,"['Schmitt, V', 'Kroger, I', 'Zinner, D', 'Call, J', 'Fischer, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-013-0616-0,SEP 2013,1,"Whether the cognitive competences of monkeys and apes are rather similar or whether the larger-brained apes outperform monkeys in cognitive experiments is a highly debated topic. Direct comparative analyses are therefore essential to examine similarities and differences among species. We here compared six primate species, including humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas (great apes), olive baboons, and long-tailed macaques (Old World monkeys) in a task on fine-grained size discrimination. Except for gorillas, subjects of all taxa (i.e. humans, apes, and monkeys) were able to discriminate three-dimensional cubes with a volume difference of only 10 % (i.e. cubes of 50 and 48 mm side length) and performed only slightly worse when the cubes were presented successively. The minimal size discriminated declined further with increasing time delay between presentations of the cubes, highlighting the difficulty to memorize exact size differences. The results suggest that differences in brain size, as a proxy for general cognitive abilities, did not account for variation in performance, but that differential socio-ecological pressures may better explain species differences. Our study highlights the fact that differences in cognitive abilities do not always map neatly onto phylogenetic relationships and that in a number of cognitive experiments monkeys do not fare significantly worse than apes, casting doubt on the assumption that larger brains per se confer an advantage in such kinds of tests."

HIV-1 M is subdivided into nine subtypes and a wide diversity of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms. The heterogenic HIV-1 M subtype/CRF distribution is the result of founder effects. The genetic diversity of HIV-1 continues to increase overtime due to demographic factors such as travel and migration and frequent co/superinfections. In addition, the expanded access to antiretrovirals leads to an increasing number of drug-resistant strains, especially in resource limited countries."

Material and methods. - Bony pelves from fossil material (Australopithecus afarensis AL 288-1, Australopithecus africanus Sts14, Australopithecus Stw 431 and Mh2), 133 modern humans (82 adult females and 51 adult males) and 67 anthropoid primates (36 gorilla, 26 Pan troglodytes, 5 Pongo pygmaeus) were reconstructed and compared (shape and morphometric analysis) using 16 pelvimetric mesasurements.

Results. - Pelves of australopithecines were characterized by lower anteroposterior (AP) and transverse (TRV) diameters in inlet pelvis than in other species. Index (AP/TRV) of pelvic inlet, midpelvis and pelvic outlet in the australopithecines were the lowest (<100) and the pelvic shape was platypelloid. A logarithmic factorial analysis showed that the pelvic morphology of australopithecines was different from humans and non-hominid primates but nearer the humans.

Discussion and conclusion. - In contrast with apes where obstetrical mechanics seem to be easier, and because of platypelloidy, mechanism of birth in australopithecines was as difficult as in modern homo sapiens. Birth without cesarean was probably possible in an asynclitic TRV orientation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."

Yet, most studies concentrate on the type of grip used. Moreover, kinematic studies remain limited to a few investigations of the distal elements in constrained conditions in humans and macaques. In order to improve our understanding of the prehension movement in primates, we analyse here the behavioural strategies (e.g., types of grip, body postures) as well as the 3D kinematics of the whole forelimb and the trunk during the prehension of small static food items in five primate species in unconstrained conditions. All species preferred the quadrupedal posture except lemurs, which used a typical crouched posture. Grasp type differed among species, with smaller animals (capuchins and lemurs) using a whole-hand grip and larger animals (humans, gorillas, chimpanzees) using predominantly a precision grip. Larger animals had lower relative wrist velocities and spent a larger proportion of the movement decelerating. Humans grasped food items with planar motions involving small joint rotations, more similar to the smaller animals than to gorillas and chimpanzees, which used greater rotations of both the shoulder and forearm. In conclusion, the features characterising human food prehension are present in other primates, yet differences exist in joint motions. These results provide a good basis to suggest hypotheses concerning the factors involved in driving the evolution of grasping abilities in primates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
The Invisible Gorilla Strikes Again Sustained Inattentional Blindness in Expert Observers,"['Drew, T', 'Vo, MLH', 'Wolfe, JM']",PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE,10.1177/0956797613479386,SEP 2013,29,"Researchers have shown that people often miss the occurrence of an unexpected yet salient event if they are engaged in a different task, a phenomenon known as inattentional blindness. However, demonstrations of inattentional blindness have typically involved naive observers engaged in an unfamiliar task. What about expert searchers who have spent years honing their ability to detect small abnormalities in specific types of images? We asked 24 radiologists to perform a familiar lung-nodule detection task. A gorilla, 48 times the size of the average nodule, was inserted in the last case that was presented. Eighty-three percent of the radiologists did not see the gorilla. Eye tracking revealed that the majority of those who missed the gorilla looked directly at its location. Thus, even expert searchers, operating in their domain of expertise, are vulnerable to inattentional blindness."
Sex differences in tool use acquisition in bonobos (Pan paniscus),"['Boose, KJ', 'White, FJ', 'Meinelt, A']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22155,SEP 2013,6,"All the great ape species are known tool users in both the wild and captivity, although there is great variation in ability and behavioral repertoire. Differences in tool use acquisition between chimpanzees and gorillas have been attributed to differing levels of social tolerance as a result of differences in social structure. Chimpanzees also show sex differences in acquisition and both chimpanzees and bonobos demonstrate a female bias in tool use behaviors. Studies of acquisition are limited in the wild and between species comparisons are complicated in captivity by contexts that often do not reflect natural conditions. Here we investigated tool use acquisition in a captive group of naive bonobos by simulating naturalistic conditions. We constructed an artificial termite mound fashioned after those that occur in the wild and tested individuals within a social group context. We found sex differences in latencies to attempt and to succeed where females attempted to fish, were successful more quickly, and fished more frequently than males. We compared our results to those reported for chimpanzees and gorillas. Males across all three species did not differ in latency to attempt or to succeed. In contrast, bonobo and chimpanzee females succeeded more quickly than did female gorillas. Female bonobos and female chimpanzees did not differ in either latency to attempt or to succeed. We tested the social tolerance hypothesis by investigating the relationship between tool behaviors and number of neighbors present. We also compared these results to those reported for chimpanzees and gorillas and found that bonobos had the fewest numbers of neighbors present. The results of this study do not support the association between number of neighbors and tool behavior reported for chimpanzees. However, bonobos demonstrated a similar sex difference in tool use acquisition, supporting the hypothesis of a female bias in tool use in Pan. Am. J. Primatol. 75:917-926, 2013.

Effective sociodemographic population assessment of elusive species in ecology and conservation management,"['Head, JS', 'Boesch, C', 'Robbins, MM', 'Rabanal, LI', 'Makaga, L', 'Kuhl, HS']",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1002/ece3.670,SEP 2013,7,"Wildlife managers are urgently searching for improved sociodemographic population assessment methods to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented conservation activities. These need to be inexpensive, appropriate for a wide spectrum of species and straightforward to apply by local staff members with minimal training. Furthermore, conservation management would benefit from single approaches which cover many aspects of population assessment beyond only density estimates, to include for instance social and demographic structure, movement patterns, or species interactions. Remote camera traps have traditionally been used to measure species richness. Currently, there is a rapid move toward using remote camera trapping in density estimation, community ecology, and conservation management. Here, we demonstrate such comprehensive population assessment by linking remote video trapping, spatially explicit capture- recapture (SECR) techniques, and other methods. We apply it to three species: chimpanzees Pan troglodytes troglodytes, gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla, and forest elephants Loxodonta cyclotis in Loango National Park, Gabon. All three species exhibited considerable heterogeneity in capture probability at the sex or group level and density was estimated at 1.72, 1.2, and 1.37 individuals per km 2 and male to female sex ratios were 1:2.1, 1:3.2, and 1:2 for chimpanzees, gorillas, and elephants, respectively. Association patterns revealed four, eight, and 18 independent social groups of chimpanzees, gorillas, and elephants, respectively: key information for both conservation management and studies on the species' ecology. Additionally, there was evidence of resident and nonresident elephants within the study area and intersexual variation in home range size among elephants but not chimpanzees. Our study highlights the potential of combining camera trapping and SECR methods in conducting detailed population assessments that go far beyond documenting species diversity patterns or estimating single species population size. Our study design is widely applicable to other species and spatial scales, and moderately trained staff members can collect and process the required data. Furthermore, assessments using the same method can be extended to include several other ecological, behavioral, and demographic aspects: fission and fusion dynamics and intergroup transfers, birth and mortality rates, species interactions, and ranging patterns."

Alternative biological assumptions strongly influence models of climate change effects on mountain gorillas,"['Thorne, JH', 'Seo, C', 'Basabose, A', 'Gray, M', 'Belfiore, NM', 'Hijmans, RJ']",ECOSPHERE,10.1890/ES13-00123.1,SEP 2013,2,"Endangered species conservation planning needs to consider the effects of future climate change. Species distribution models are commonly used to predict future shifts in habitat suitability. We evaluated the effects of climate change on the highly endangered mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) using a variety of modeling approaches, and assessing model outputs from the perspective of three spatial habitat management strategies: status quo, expansion and relocation. We show that alternative assumptions about the ecological niche of mountain gorillas can have a very large effect on model predictions. ` Standard' correlative models using 18 climatic predictor variables suggested that by 2090 there would be no suitable habitat left for the mountain gorilla in its existing parks, whereas a `limiting-factor' model, that uses a proxy of primary productivity, suggested that climate suitability would not change much. Species distribution models based on fewer predictor variables, on alternative assumptions about niche conservatism (including or excluding the other subspecies Gorilla beringii graueri), and a model based on gorilla behavior, had intermediate predictions. These alternative models show strong variation, and, in contrast to the standard approach with 18 variables, suggest that mountain gorilla habitat in the parks may remain suitable, that protected areas could be expanded into lower (warmer) areas, and that there might be climactically suitable habitat in other places where new populations could possibly be established. Differences among model predictions point to avenues for model improvement and further research. Similarities among model predictions point to possible areas for climate change adaptation management. For species with narrow distributions, such as the mountain gorilla, modeling the impact of climate change should be based on careful evaluation of their biology, particularly of the factors that currently appear to limit their distribution, and should avoid the naive application of standard correlative methods with many predictor variables."
Dynamics of DNA Methylation in Recent Human and Great Ape Evolution,"['Hernando-Herraez, I', 'Prado-Martinez, J', 'Garg, P', 'Fernandez-Callejo, M', 'Heyn, H', 'Hvilsom, C', 'Navarro, A', 'Esteller, M', 'Sharp, AJ', 'Marques-Bonet, T']",PLOS GENETICS,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003763,SEP 2013,25,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification involved in regulatory processes such as cell differentiation during development, X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting and susceptibility to complex disease. However, the dynamics of DNA methylation changes between humans and their closest relatives are still poorly understood. We performed a comparative analysis of CpG methylation patterns between 9 humans and 23 primate samples including all species of great apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and orangutan) using Illumina Methylation450 bead arrays. Our analysis identified similar to 800 genes with significantly altered methylation patterns among the great apes, including similar to 170 genes with a methylation pattern unique to human. Some of these are known to be involved in developmental and neurological features, suggesting that epigenetic changes have been frequent during recent human and primate evolution. We identified a significant positive relationship between the rate of coding variation and alterations of methylation at the promoter level, indicative of co-occurrence between evolution of protein sequence and gene regulation. In contrast, and supporting the idea that many phenotypic differences between humans and great apes are not due to amino acid differences, our analysis also identified 184 genes that are perfectly conserved at protein level between human and chimpanzee, yet show significant epigenetic differences between these two species. We conclude that epigenetic alterations are an important force during primate evolution and have been under-explored in evolutionary comparative genomics."
Genome-wide temporal responses of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to MPP+ neurotoxicity,"['Kim, IS', 'Choi, DK', 'Do, JH']",BIOCHIP JOURNAL,10.1007/s13206-013-7308-3,SEP 2013,3,"The development of a stable and reliable dopaminergic (DAergic) neuronal injury model is particularly necessary for studying the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and developing therapeutic strategies. As SH-SY5Y cells express the dopamine transporter (DAT), a protein expressed in DAergic neurons within the central nervous system, SH-SY5Y cells has been widely used in studies of mechanisms of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium (MPP+)-induced neurotoxicity and the pathogenesis underlying MPP+-induced PD mimics. However, the genome-wide time dependent gene expression change of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells by MPP+ toxicity has not been characterized. Here, we carried out a time series microarray experiment consisting of eight time points including time 0 (control) and 0.5, 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h after MPP+ treatment using IIlumina human HT-12 expression v.4 bead array. The differentially expressed genes from time series microarray data were identified using the EDGE (Extraction of Differential Gene Expression) software package. In this study, 79 and 838 genes are considered significant at a 0.1% and 1% false-discovery rate level, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of these genes was carried out with the GOrilla web-server interactive software.

Adenoviruses isolated from wild gorillas are closely related to human species C viruses,"['McVey, D', 'Cranfield, MR', 'Torano, H', 'Kuete, HM', 'Lee, GP', 'Glenn, A', 'Bruder, JT', 'Rangel, D', 'Brough, DE', 'Gall, JG']",VIROLOGY,10.1016/j.virol.2013.05.041,SEP 2013,0,"We have isolated and cultured three distinct adenoviruses from wild gorillas. Phylogenetic analysis grouped the viruses with human adenovirus species C based on DNA polymerase, hexon, and E4ORF6 genes. The three wild gorilla adenoviruses clustered with the other species C captive gorilla adenoviruses, forming a branch separate from human and chimpanzee/bonobo adenoviruses. Animal sera to the three newly isolated viruses did not cross-neutralize, demonstrating serological distinctiveness. The human adenovirus 5 fiber knob blocked infection, suggesting use of the Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor. These viruses may provide viral vectors with properties distinct from chimpanzee adenovirus and human adenovirus vectors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Pigeons learn virtual patterned-string problems in a computerized touch screen environment,"['Wasserman, EA', 'Nagasaka, Y', 'Castro, L', 'Brzykcy, SJ']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-013-0608-0,SEP 2013,5,"For many decades, developmental and comparative psychologists have used a variety of string tasks to assess the perceptual and cognitive capabilities of human children of different ages and different species of nonhuman animals. The most important and widely used of these problems are patterned-string tasks, in which the organism is shown two or more strings, only one of which is connected to a reward. The organism must determine which string is attached to the reward and pull it. We report a new way to implement patterned-string tasks via a computerized touch screen apparatus. Pigeons successfully learned such virtual patterned-string tasks and exhibited the same general performance profile as animals given conventional patterned-string tasks. In addition, variations in the length, separation, and alignment of the strings reliably affected the pigeons' virtual string-pulling behavior. These results not only testify to the power and versatility of our computerized string task, but they also demonstrate that pigeons can concurrently contend with a broad range of demanding patterned-string problems, thereby eliminating many alternative interpretations of their behavior. The virtual patterned-string task may thus permit expanded exploration of other species and variables which would be unlikely to be undertaken either because of inadequacies of conventional methodology or sensorimotor limitations of the studied organisms."

The origins of human parasites: Exploring the evidence for endoparasitism throughout human evolution,"['Mitchell, PD']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PALEOPATHOLOGY,10.1016/j.ijpp.2013.08.003,SEP 2013,4,"It is important to determine the origins of human parasites if we are to understand the health of past populations and the effects of parasitism upon human evolution. It also helps us to understand emerging infectious diseases and the modern clinical epidemiology of parasites. This study aims to distinguish those heirloom parasites that have infected humans and their ancestors throughout their evolution in Africa from those recent souvenir species to which humans have only become exposed following contact with animals during their migration across the globe. Ten such heirloom parasites are proposed, which appear to have been spread across the globe. Six further heirlooms are noted to have limited spread due to the constraints of their life cycle. Twelve souvenir parasites of humans are described, along with their animal reservoirs. While the origins of 28 species of endoparasite have been determined, many more species require further assessment once a more systematic analysis of ancient parasites in other regions of Africa has been undertaken.

Natural category discrimination in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at three levels of abstraction,"['Vonk, J', 'Jett, S', 'Mosteller, K', 'Galvan, M']",LEARNING & BEHAVIOR,10.3758/s13420-013-0103-0,SEP 2013,2,"Two adult chimpanzees were presented with a series of natural category discrimination tasks on a touch screen computer, in which the discriminations varied in degree of abstraction. At the concrete level, discriminations could be made on the basis of single perceptual features, but at the more abstract level, categories were more inclusive, containing exemplars with variant perceptual features. For instance, at the most abstract level, the chimpanzees were required to select images of animals rather than nonanimals, and exemplars within both categories were perceptually diverse. One chimpanzee showed positive transfer at each level of abstraction but required more sessions to reach criterion as the discriminations became more abstract. The other chimpanzee failed to demonstrate consistent significant acquisition of a concept. The results indicate that unlike other apes and black bears, tested previously, chimpanzees found the most abstract discriminations the most difficult to acquire. Analyses of the features of pictures that yielded high or low accuracy revealed no significant differences on several key features, suggesting that the presence of facial features, eyes, or specific coloration did not control responding. In addition, the chimpanzees performed more accurately with photos judged as less typical exemplars of the category by human raters. However, responses to pictures of particular species suggest that chimpanzees may rely on perceptual similarity to familiar exemplars when acquiring experimenter-defined natural categories."
Considering the role of social dynamics and positional behavior in gestural communication research,"['Smith, LW', 'Delgado, RA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22151,SEP 2013,2,"While the hominin fossil record cannot inform us on either the presence or extent of social and cognitive abilities that may have paved the way for the emergence of language, studying non-vocal communication among our closest living relatives, the African apes, may provide valuable information about how language originated. Although much has been learned from gestural signaling in non-human primates, we have not yet established how and why gestural repertoires vary across species, what factors influence this variation, and how knowledge of these differences can contribute to an understanding of gestural signaling's contribution to language evolution. In this paper, we review arguments surrounding the theory that language evolved from gestural signaling and suggest some important factors to consider when conducting comparative studies of gestural communication among African apes. Specifically, we propose that social dynamics and positional behavior are critical components that shape the frequency and nature of gestural signaling across species and we argue that an understanding of these factors could shed light on how gestural communication may have been the basis of human language. We outline predictions for the influence of these factors on the frequencies and types of gestures used across the African apes and highlight the importance of including these factors in future gestural communication research with primates.

"Population Status of Pan troglodytes verus in Lagoas de Cufada Natural Park, Guinea-Bissau","['Carvalho, JS', 'Marques, TA', 'Vicente, L']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0071527,AUG 7 2013,4,"The western chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes verus, has been classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1988. Intensive agriculture, commercial plantations, logging, and mining have eliminated or degraded the habitats suitable for P. t. verus over a large part of its range. In this study we assessed the effect of land-use change on the population size and density of chimpanzees at Lagoas de Cufada Natural Park (LCNP), Guinea-Bissau. We further explored chimpanzee distribution in relation to landscape-level proxies of human disturbance. Nest count and distance-sampling methods were employed along 11 systematically placed linear transects in 2010 and 2011. Estimated nest decay rate was 293.9 days (%CV = 58.8). Based on this estimate of decay time and using the Standing-Crop Nest Count Method, we obtained a habitat-weighted average chimpanzee density estimate for 2011 of 0.22 nest building chimpanzees/km(2) (95% CI 0.08-0.62), corresponding to 137 (95% CI 51.0-390.0) chimpanzees for LCNP. Human disturbance had a negative influence on chimpanzee distribution as nests were built farther away from human settlements, roads, and rivers than if they were randomly distributed, coinciding with the distribution of the remaining patches of dense canopy forest. We conclude that the continuous disappearance of suitable habitat (e. g. the replacement of LCNP's dense forests by monocultures of cashew plantations) may be compromising the future of one of the most threatened Guinean coastal chimpanzee populations. We discuss strategies to ensure long-term conservation in this important refuge for this chimpanzee subspecies at its westernmost margin of geographic distribution."
"Long-Term Monitoring of Microsporidia, Cryptosporidium and Giardia Infections in Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Different Stages of Habituation in Dzanga Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic","['Sak, B', 'Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Kvetonova, D', 'Mynarova, A', 'Shutt, KA', 'Pomajbikova, K', 'Kalousova, B', 'Modry, D', 'Benavides, J', 'Todd, A', 'Kvac, M']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0071840,AUG 7 2013,12,"Background: Infectious diseases pose one of the greatest threats to endangered species, and a risk of gastrointestinal parasite transmission from humans to wildlife has always been considered as a major concern of tourism. Increased anthropogenic impact on primate populations may result in general changes in communities of their parasites, and also in a direct exchange of parasites between humans and primates.

Aims: To evaluate the impact of close contact with humans on the occurrence of potentially zoonotic protists in great apes, we conducted a long-term monitoring of microsporidia, Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections in western lowland gorillas at different stages of the habituation process, humans, and other wildlife in Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas in the Central African Republic.

Results: We detected Encephalitozoon cuniculi genotypes I and II (7.5%), Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotype D and three novel genotypes (gorilla 1-3) (4.0%), Giardia intestinalis subgroup A II (2.0%) and Cryptosporidium bovis (0.5%) in gorillas, whereas in humans we found only G. intestinalis subgroup A II (2.1%). In other wild and domestic animals we recorded E. cuniculi genotypes I and II (2.1%), G. intestinalis assemblage E (0.5%) and C. muris TS03 (0.5%).

Conclusion: Due to the non-specificity of E. cuniculi genotypes we conclude that detection of the exact source of E. cuniculi infection is problematic. As Giardia intestinalis was recorded primarily in gorilla groups with closer human contact, we suggest that human-gorilla transmission has occurred. We call attention to a potentially negative impact of habituation on selected pathogens which might occur as a result of the more frequent presence of humans in the vicinity of both gorillas under habituation and habituated gorillas, rather than as a consequence of the close contact with humans, which might be a more traditional assumption. We encourage to observe the sections concerning hygiene from the IUCN best practice guidelines for all sites where increased human-gorilla contact occurs."
Memory for Distant Past Events in Chimpanzees and Orangutans,"['Martin-Ordas, G', 'Berntsen, D', 'Call, J', 'INVOLUNTARY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORIES']",CURRENT BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cub.2013.06.017,AUG 5 2013,12,"Determining the memory systems that support nonhuman animals' capacity to remember distant past events is currently the focus an intense research effort and a lively debate [1-3]. Comparative psychology has largely adopted Tulving's framework by focusing on whether animals remember what-where-when something happened (i.e., episodic-like memory) [4-6]. However, apes have also been reported to recall other episodic components [7] after single-trial exposures [8, 9]. Using a new experimental paradigm we show that chimpanzees and orangutans recalled a tool-finding event that happened four times 3 years earlier (experiment 1) and a tool-finding unique event that happened once 2 weeks earlier (experiment 2). Subjects were able to distinguish these events from other tool-finding events, which indicates binding of relevant temporal-spatial components. Like in human involuntary autobiographical memory, a cued, associative retrieval process triggered apes' memories: when presented with a particular setup, subjects instantaneously remembered not only where to search for the tools (experiment 1), but also the location of the tool seen only once (experiment 2). The complex nature of the events retrieved, the unexpected and fast retrieval, the long retention intervals involved, and the detection of binding strongly suggest that chimpanzees and orangutans' memories for past events mirror some of the features of human autobiographical memory."
Male genetic structure and paternity in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Inoue, E', 'Akomo-Okoue, EF', 'Ando, C', 'Iwata, Y', 'Judai, M', 'Fujita, S', 'Hongo, S', 'Nze-Nkogue, C', 'Inoue-Murayama, M', 'Yamagiwa, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22312,AUG 2013,12,"The male dispersal patterns of western lowland gorillas (WLGs, Gorilla gorilla gorilla) are not well understood. To determine whether most silverbacks stay close to their relatives, we analyzed autosomal and Y-chromosomal microsatellites (STRs) in wild WLGs at Moukalaba, Gabon. We obtained STR genotypes for 38 individuals, including eight silverbacks and 12 adult females in an approximately 40 km(2) area. Among them, 20 individuals were members of one identified group (Group Gentil; GG), including one silverback and six adult females. The silverback sired all 13 of the offspring in GG and no Y-STR polymorphism within GG was found, as expected in a one-male group structure. Over all silverbacks sampled, Y-STR diversity was high considering the limited sampling area, and silverbacks with similar Y-STR haplotypes were not always located in nearby areas. Although the misclassification rate of kinship estimates in this study was not negligible, there were no kin dyads among all silverbacks sampled. These results suggest that silverbacks born in the same group do not stay close to each other after maturation. The Y-STR diversity in this study was similar to that of a previous study conducted in an area that was approximately 150 times larger than our study area. Similarity of WLG Y-STR diversity between studies at different sampling scales suggests that male gene flow may not be geographically limited. These results suggest that WLG males normally disperse from their natal areas after maturation, at least, in Moukalaba. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
"Postnatal temporal bone ontogeny in Pan, Gorilla, and Homo, and the implications for temporal bone ontogeny in Australopithecus afarensis","['Terhune, CE', 'Kimbel, WH', 'Lockwood, CA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22318,AUG 2013,3,"Assessments of temporal bone morphology have played an important role in taxonomic and phylogenetic evaluations of fossil taxa, and recent three-dimensional analyses of this region have supported the utility of the temporal bone for testing taxonomic and phylogenetic hypotheses. But while clinical analyses have examined aspects of temporal bone ontogeny in humans, the ontogeny of the temporal bone in non-human taxa is less well documented. This study examines ontogenetic allometry of the temporal bone in order to address several research questions related to the pattern and trajectory of temporal bone shape change during ontogeny in the African apes and humans. We further apply these data to a preliminary analysis of temporal bone ontogeny in Australopithecus afarensis. Three-dimensional landmarks were digitized on an ontogenetic series of specimens of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla. Data were analyzed using geometric morphometric methods, and shape changes throughout ontogeny in relation to size were compared. Results of these analyses indicate that, despite broadly similar patterns, African apes and humans show marked differences in development of the mandibular fossa and tympanic portions of the temporal bone. These findings indicate divergent, rather than parallel, postnatal ontogenetic allometric trajectories for temporal bone shape in these taxa. The pattern of temporal bone shape change with size exhibited by A. afarensis showed some affinities to that of humans, but was most similar to extant African apes, particularly Gorilla.

How Effective Are Geometric Morphometric Techniques for Assessing Functional Shape Variation? An Example From the Great Ape Temporomandibular Joint,"['Terhune, CE']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.22724,AUG 2013,3,"Functional shape analyses have long relied on the use of shape ratios to test biomechanical hypotheses. This method is powerful because of the ease with which results are interpreted, but these techniques fall short in quantifying complex morphologies that may not have a strong biomechanical foundation but may still be functionally informative. In contrast, geometric morphometric methods are continually being adopted for quantifying complex shapes, but they tend to prove inadequate in functional analyses because they have little foundation in an explicit biomechanical framework. The goal of this study was to evaluate the intersection of these two methods using the great ape temporomandibular joint as a case study. Three-dimensional coordinates of glenoid fossa and mandibular condyle shape were collected using a Microscribe digitizer. Linear distances extracted from these landmarks were analyzed using a series of one-way ANOVAs; further, the landmark configurations were analyzed using geometric morphometric techniques. Results suggest that the two methods are broadly similar, although the geometric morphometric data allow for the identification of shape differences among taxa that were not immediately apparent in the univariate analyses. Furthermore, this study suggests several new approaches for translating these shape data into a biomechanical context by adjusting the data using a biomechanically relevant variable.

Scottish wildcat (Felis silvestris grampia) personality and subjective well-being: Implications for captive management,"['Gartner, MC', 'Weiss, A']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2012.11.002,AUG 2013,5,"Research in animal personality has been increasing over the last decade, as scientists realize its importance to health outcomes. In particular, personality has sometimes been used, in conjunction with other tools, for aspects of captive management, including decreasing stress, increasing positive health outcomes, successful breeding, and infant survival. A few such studies have focused on felids, and have shown that there are possible applications for personality in that taxon. This study looked at the Scottish wildcat (Felis silvestris grampia), a critically endangered species, with only an estimated 400 left in the wild. Raters assessed 25 Scottish wildcats on 42 traits and on a subjective well-being questionnaire. Mean inter-rater reliability on the personality items was 0.59 and 0.53 on the subjective well-being items. Three personality components were found using principal-components analysis: Dominance, Agreeableness, and Self Control. Higher Self Control was related to higher subjective well-being (r = 0.67, P < 0.01). Implications for the results of this and other similar studies are discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Behavioral correlates and welfare implications of informal interactions between caretakers and zoo-housed chimpanzees and gorillas,"['Chelluri, GI', 'Ross, SR', 'Wagner, KE']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2012.06.008,AUG 2013,5,"In captive animal facilities, human staff members are a relevant part of the animals' social environment in addition to providing care and managing the social group. Structured, predictable interactions and relaxed, spontaneous contacts may all affect the animals' behavior and well-being, both immediately and in the long term. This study examined the association between unstructured, affiliative caretaker-animal interactions and the behavior of zoo-housed chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). The interactions in question included play, spontaneous feeding, and other positive vocal and visual interactions performed through a protective mesh barrier. Behavioral data collected over 48 months were used to identify correlates of caretaker interactions among key behaviors relevant to welfare assessment, including agonism, sexual behavior, abnormal behavior, prosocial behavior, and self-directed behavior, as well as the presence of wounds. In observational sessions containing one or more caretaker interactions, chimpanzees and gorillas both showed higher agonism (P = 0.044 and P = 0.042, respectively) and lower self-directed behavior (P = 0.035 for chimpanzees and P = 0.001 for gorillas) than in control samples. Agonism rose in chimpanzees from an average of 0.01-0.12% of overall behaviors, and in gorillas from 0% to 0.1%, while self-directed behavior decreased in chimpanzees from an average of 9:54-7.81% and in gorillas from 11.02% to 7.38%. Chimpanzees also showed lower intraspecific prosocial behavior in samples with caretaker interactions (P = 0.044), decreasing from an average of 11.5% to 5.52% of overall behaviors. Finally, gorillas exhibited less abnormal behavior in caretaker interaction samples than in control samples (P = 0.029), decreasing from a mean of 2.42-1.77% of overall behaviors. In chimpanzees, higher agonism and lower prosocial behavior are indicative of greater arousal, although we would expect self-directed behavior to rise rather than decrease in that situation. The results in gorillas are mixed with respect to welfare outcomes: higher agonism is indicative of arousal, but lower abnormal and self-directed behaviors suggest a decrease in stress and anxiety. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the influence of all forms of interaction with heterospecifics and demonstrate a need for welfare assessments that include even positively intended interactions.

Effects of age and group type on social behaviour of male western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in North American zoos,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Lukas, KE', 'Kuhar, CW']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2013.07.003,AUG 2013,2,"The long-term management of male gorillas in zoos is a significant challenge. The demographics of the population - specifically a 50/50 sex ratio and the desire to form breeding groups that contain a single male and multiple females - necessitates housing a majority of adult males outside of mixed-sex groups. The primary approach for socially housing these individuals within the North American population has been the formation of all-male groups. Our previous research had found that captive all-male groups were cohesive and showed behavioural patterns similar to what had been observed in the wild. To gain a more complete understanding of male social dynamics as a function of group type, we examined social interactions among male gorillas living in either bachelor or mixed-sex groups. Subjects included 48 individuals ranging in age from 6 to 94 years. Overall, we found age to be the primary predictor of social behaviour. Rates of affiliative behaviour were highest in immaturity with a gradual shift to more dominance related behaviours (displacements, non-contact aggression) in young adulthood. Non-contact aggression increased as a function of number of adult males in the group, which likely accounts for higher rates of non-contact aggression in silverbacks living in all-male as compared to mixed-sex groups. The results further reiterate that all-male groups are a feasible, long-term housing strategy for male gorillas in zoos and highlight important considerations for male management including: introduction of males in immaturity, delayed formation of breeding groups until males reach social as well as physical maturity, and the role of dominance-related behaviours, as opposed to escalated aggression, in adult male interactions.

Influence of Food Resources on the Ranging Pattern of Northern Pig-tailed Macaques (Macaca leonina),"['Albert, A', 'Huynen, MC', 'Savini, T', 'Hambuckers, A']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-013-9690-z,AUG 2013,5,"Food availability may influence primates' home range size and use. Understanding this relationship may facilitate the design of conservation strategies. We aimed to determine how fruit availability influences the ranging patterns of a group of northern pig-tailed macaques (Macaca leonina) living around the visitor center of Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. We predicted that macaques would increase their range during low fruit abundance periods to gather high-quality food and that they would go where there are more fruits or more fruits of particular species. We also predicted that human food, linked to human presence, would attract the macaques. We followed the macaques and recorded their diet and movements within their home range. We superimposed a grid on kernels defining the monthly home range surface to compare spatially macaques' travel and the availability of fruits measured on botanical transects. Our results showed that the macaques increased their monthly home range in March, probably to obtain newly available fruits. During high fruit abundance seasons, they spent more time near particular fruit species. In August and September, although fruits became rare again, macaques kept their home range large, perhaps to find enough fruits as supplies dwindled. Finally, from October to February, they decreased their monthly home range size while consuming human food, a high-quality item. In conclusion, the macaques used several ranging strategies according to fruit availability. However, we think that, without human food, macaques would tend to increase their range during low fruit abundance periods, as predicted."
Identifying Species in Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) Feces: A Methodological Lost Cause?,"['Phillips, CA', 'McGrew, WC']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-013-9696-6,AUG 2013,5,"Ascertaining the full range of dietary constituents of a primate population allows the identification of habitats with important food resources and can assist efforts to conserve primates. For unhabituated populations, we can acquire otherwise unobtainable dietary information from macroscopic inspection of fecal samples. This method has made a significant contribution to understanding food intake in various primate species. Increasing knowledge of the omnivorous diet of our closest living relatives, the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and the bonobo (P. paniscus), which range and forage in various habitats to meet daily nutrient requirements, provides more scope to assess human omnivory and its evolution from our last common ancestor. However, macroscopic inspection may lead to bias toward undigested and therefore identifiable food items, e.g., fruit seeds, vs. pulverized components, e.g., leaves, that are unidentifiable at this level. This study seeks to validate findings from macroscopic inspection by comparing species identified in fecal samples from select individuals vs. data from direct observations of their feeding. We collected data from 10 adult chimpanzees of the Kanyawara community in Kibale National Park. We identified 86% of species from which fruit had been eaten vs. only 21% from which leaves had been eaten in fecal samples analyzed. This study provides empirical support for previous assumptions and confirms the limitations of macroscopic inspection of feces for identifying the nonfrugivorous dietary elements to species level. However, valuable insights into seasonality of diet can be gleaned from macroscopic inspection. Also, if we combine data on species identified in feces with direct observation of food intake, we can establish when food items were eaten, which enables estimations of gut passage rates for wild populations. Finally, analyzing fecal samples collected from various group members can provide insight into the dietary repertoire at the individual level."
"Applying resource selection functions at multiple scales to prioritize habitat use by the endangered Cross River gorilla
","['Sawyer, SC', 'Brashares, JS']",DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,10.1111/ddi.12046,AUG 2013,4,"Aim The critically endangered Cross River gorilla is a patchily distributed taxon for which habitat selection has been modelled only at coarse spatial scales, using remotely sensed landscape data and large-scale species distribution maps. These coarse-scale models fail to explain why Cross River gorillas (CRG) display a highly fragmented distribution within what appears to be a large, continuous area of suitable habitat. This study aimed to refine our understanding of CRG habitat use to inform conservation planning both for the subspecies and for other fragmented species of conservation concern.

Location Cross River gorillas occur only in a discontinuous distribution in the southern portion of the Cameroon-Nigeria border region, an area that represents one of Africa's biodiversity hotspots. This study was carried out in the Northern Mone-Mt. Oko region, part of the Mone/Mbulu forest system located in the Manyu division of the South-west Province of Cameroon.

Methods We used resource selection functions to understand habitat use by CRG at multiple scales. Specifically, we employed generalized additive models at the scale of the annual subpopulation range and conditional logistic regression at the scale of individual movements.

Results Cross River gorillas habitat selection is highly scale dependent. Localized measures of habitat quality strongly influenced selection at the subpopulation or landscape scale, while human activity and food availability were the best predictors of selection at finer scales.

Main conclusions Understanding why CRG do not occur in seemingly suitable habitat is crucial for designating critical habitat both within and between CRG subpopulations. Our results indicate that conservation planning to maintain critical habitat and connectivity among CRG populations will require an integrative, multi-scale planning approach incorporating large-scale landscape characteristics, human use patterns and CRG food availability."
Structure and properties of sodium aluminosilicate glasses from molecular dynamics simulations,"['Xiang, Y', 'Du, JC', 'Smedskjaer, MM', 'Mauro, JC']",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS,10.1063/1.4816378,JUL 28 2013,9,"Addition of alumina to sodium silicate glasses considerably improves the mechanical properties and chemical durability and changes other properties such as ionic conductivity and melt viscosity. As a result, aluminosilicate glasses find wide industrial and technological applications including the recent Corning (R) R Gorilla (R) R Glass. In this paper, the structures of sodium aluminosilicate glasses with a wide range of Al/Na ratios (from 1.5 to 0.6) have been studied using classical molecular dynamics simulations in a system containing around 3000 atoms, with the aim to understand the structural role of aluminum as a function of chemical composition in these glasses. The short- and medium-range structures such as aluminum coordination, bond angle distribution around cations, Q(n) distribution (n bridging oxygen per network forming tetrahedron), and ring size distribution have been systematically studied. In addition, the mechanical properties including bulk, shear, and Young's moduli have been calculated and compared with experimental data. It is found that aluminum ions are mainly four-fold coordinated in peralkaline compositions (Al/Na < 1) and form an integral part of the rigid silicon-oxygen glass network. In peraluminous compositions (Al/Na > 1), small amounts of five-fold coordinated aluminum ions are present while the concentration of six-fold coordinated aluminum is negligible. Oxygen triclusters are also found to be present in peraluminous compositions, and their concentration increases with increasing Al/Na ratio. The calculated bulk, shear, and Young's moduli were found to increase with increasing Al/Na ratio, in good agreement with experimental data. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC."

Here we sequence to high coverage a total of 79 wild-and captive-born individuals representing all six great ape species and seven subspecies and report 88.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. Our analysis provides support for genetically distinct populations within each species, signals of gene flow, and the split of common chimpanzees into two distinct groups: Nigeria-Cameroon/western and central/eastern populations. We find extensive inbreeding in almost all wild populations, with eastern gorillas being the most extreme. Inferred effective population sizes have varied radically over time in different lineages and this appears to have a profound effect on the genetic diversity at, or close to, genes in almost all species. We discover and assign 1,982 loss-of-function variants throughout the human and great ape lineages, determining that the rate of gene loss has not been different in the human branch compared to other internal branches in the great ape phylogeny. This comprehensive catalogue of great ape genome diversity provides a framework for understanding evolution and a resource for more effective management of wild and captive great ape populations."
30 Days in the Life: Daily Nutrient Balancing in a Wild Chacma Baboon,"['Johnson, CA', 'Raubenheimer, D', 'Rothman, JM', 'Clarke, D', 'Swedell, L']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0070383,JUL 24 2013,13,"For most animals, the ability to regulate intake of specific nutrients is vital to fitness. Recent studies have demonstrated nutrient regulation in nonhuman primates over periods of one observation day, though studies of humans indicate that such regulation extends to longer time frames. Little is known about longer-term regulation in nonhuman primates, however, due to the challenges of multiple-day focal follows. Here we present the first detailed study of nutrient intake across multiple days in a wild nonhuman primate. We conducted 30 consecutive all day follows on one female chacma baboon (Papio hamadryas ursinus) in the Cape Peninsula of South Africa. We documented dietary composition, compared the nutritional contribution of natural and human-derived foods to the diet, and quantified nutrient intake using the geometric framework of nutrition. Our focus on a single subject over consecutive days allowed us to examine daily dietary regulation within an individual over time. While the amounts varied daily, our subject maintained a strikingly consistent balance of protein to non-protein (fat and carbohydrate) energy across the month. Human-derived foods, while contributing a minority of the diet, were higher in fat and lower in fiber than naturally-derived foods. Our results demonstrate nutrient regulation on a daily basis in our subject, and demonstrate that she was able to maintain a diet with a constant proportional protein content despite wide variation in the composition of component foods. From a methodological perspective, the results of this study suggest that nutrient intake is best estimated over at least an entire day, with longer-term regulatory patterns (e. g., during development and reproduction) possibly requiring even longer sampling. From a management and conservation perspective, it is notable that nearly half the subject's daily energy intake derived from exotic foods, including those currently being eradicated from the study area for replacement by indigenous vegetation."
Unravelling the Functional Biomechanics of Dental Features and Tooth Wear,"['Benazzi, S', 'Nguyen, HN', 'Kullmer, O', 'Hublin, JJ', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0069990,JUL 23 2013,5,"Most of the morphological features recognized in hominin teeth, particularly the topography of the occlusal surface, are generally interpreted as an evolutionary functional adaptation for mechanical food processing. In this respect, we can also expect that the general architecture of a tooth reflects a response to withstand the high stresses produced during masticatory loadings. Here we use an engineering approach, finite element analysis (FEA), with an advanced loading concept derived from individual occlusal wear information to evaluate whether some dental traits usually found in hominin and extant great ape molars, such as the trigonid crest, the entoconid-hypoconulid crest and the protostylid have important biomechanical implications. For this purpose, FEA was applied to 3D digital models of three Gorilla gorilla lower second molars (M-2) differing in wear stages. Our results show that in unworn and slightly worn M(2)s tensile stresses concentrate in the grooves of the occlusal surface. In such condition, the trigonid and the entoconid-hypoconulid crests act to reinforce the crown locally against stresses produced along the mesiodistal groove. Similarly, the protostylid is shaped like a buttress to suffer the high tensile stresses concentrated in the deep buccal groove. These dental traits are less functional in the worn M-2, because tensile stresses decrease physiologically in the crown with progressing wear due to the enlargement of antagonistic contact areas and changes in loading direction from oblique to nearly parallel direction to the dental axis. This suggests that the wear process might have a crucial influence in the evolution and structural adaptation of molars enabling to endure bite stresses and reduce tooth failure throughout the lifetime of an individual."
Ultra-Smooth and Ultra-Strong Ion-Exchanged Glass as Substrates for Organic Electronics,"['Kafer, D', 'He, MQ', 'Li, JF', 'Pambianchi, MS', 'Feng, JW', 'Mauro, JC', 'Bao, ZN']",ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS,10.1002/adfm.201202009,JUL 5 2013,10,"The introduction of new substrate materials into the world of electronics has previously opened up new possibilities for novel applications and device designs. Here, the use of ion-exchanged sodium aluminosilicate (NAS) glass is presented as a new type of substrate that is not only highly damage resistant, but also allows the fabrication of high performance organic electronic devices. The smoothness of the NAS glass surface enables favorable growth of the semiconductor layer, enabling high charge carrier mobilities for typical organic semiconductors, such as pentacene or C60, and a polymer semiconductor. No degradation of the device performance is observed as a result of ion migration into the active device region, and no compromise in substrate strength due to the processing conditions is made. This work suggests the possibility of new, highly durable electronic devices on glass in large area format."
Non-M Variants of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1,"['Mourez, T', 'Simon, F', 'Plantier, JC']",CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS,10.1128/CMR.00012-13,JUL 2013,11,"The AIDS pandemic that started in the early 1980s is due to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) group M (HIV-M), but apart from this major group, many divergent variants have been described (HIV-1 groups N, O, and P and HIV-2). The four HIV-1 groups arose from independent cross-species transmission of the simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) SIVcpz, infecting chimpanzees, and SIVgor, infecting gorillas. This, together with human adaptation, accounts for their genomic, phylogenetic, and virological specificities. Nevertheless, the natural course of non-M HIV infection seems similar to that of HIV-M. The virological monitoring of infected patients is now possible with commercial kits, but their therapeutic management remains complex. All non-M variants were principally described for patients linked to Cameroon, where HIV-O accounts for 1% of all HIV infections; only 15 cases of HIV-N infection and 2 HIV-P infections have been reported. Despite improvements in our knowledge, many fascinating questions remain concerning the origin, genetic evolution, and slow spread of these variants. Other variants may already exist or may arise in the future, calling for close surveillance. This review provides a comprehensive, up-to-date summary of the current knowledge on these pathogens, including the historical background of their discovery; the latest advances in the comprehension of their origin and spread; and clinical, therapeutic, and laboratory aspects that may be useful for the management and the treatment of patients infected with these divergent viruses."

The role of many wildlife species as reservoirs for arthropod-borne viral pathogens is poorly understood. We investigated the exposure history of various African wildlife species from the Congo basin to mosquito-borne flaviviruses and alphaviruses by testing archived serum samples. Sera from 24 African forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), 34 African elephants (Loxodonta africana), 40 duikers (Cephalophus and Philantomba spp.), 25 mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx), 32 mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), five Grauer's gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri), two L'Hoest's monkeys (Cercopithecus lhoesti), two golden monkeys (Cercopithecus kandti), and three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) sampled between 1991 and 2009 were tested for antibodies against chikungunya virus (CHIKV), o'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), West Nile virus (WNV), dengue 2 virus (DENV-2), and yellow fever virus (YFV) by plaque reduction neutralization test. Specific neutralizing antibodies against ONNV were found in African forest buffalo in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Gabon, duikers in the DRC, and mandrills in Gabon, providing novel evidence of enzootic circulation of ONNV in these countries. African forest buffalo in the DRC and Gabon also demonstrated evidence of exposure to CHIKV, WNV, and DENV-2, while mandrills in Gabon were antibody positive for CHIKV, DENV-2, WNV, and YFV. All of the elephants tested had a strong neutralizing antibody response to WNV. We also document results from a survey of gorillas for arboviruses, of which 4/32 (13%) had antibody to an alphavirus or flavivirus. Overall, our results demonstrate a high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against multiple arboviruses in wildlife in equatorial Africa."

Sorting into outsourcing: Are profits taxed at a gorilla's arm's length?,"['Bauer, CJ', 'Langenmayr, D']",JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,10.1016/j.jinteco.2012.12.002,JUL 2013,2,"This article analyzes profit taxation according to the arm's length principle in a model where heterogeneous firms sort into foreign outsourcing. We show that multinational firms are able to shift profits abroad even if they fully comply with the tax code. This is because, in equilibrium, intra-firm transactions occur in firms that are better than the market at input production. Moreover, market input prices include a mark-up that arises from the bargaining between the firm and the independent supplier. Transfer prices set at market values following the arm's length principle thus systematically exceed multinationals' marginal costs, leading to a reduction of tax payments for each unit sold. The optimal organization of firms hence provides a new rationale for the empirically observed lower tax burden of multinational corporations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Here, we studied one of these palindromes, P6, in order to illuminate the dynamics of the gene conversion process. We genotyped ten paralogous sequence variants (PSVs) within the arms of P6 in 378 Y chromosomes whose evolutionary relationships within the SNP-defined Y phylogeny are known. This allowed the identification of 146 historical gene conversion events involving individual PSVs, occurring at a rate of 2.9-8.4x10(-4) events per generation. A consideration of the nature of nucleotide change and the ancestral state of each PSV showed that the conversion process was significantly biased towards the fixation of G or C nucleotides (GC-biased), and also towards the ancestral state. Determination of haplotypes by long-PCR allowed likely co-conversion of PSVs to be identified, and suggested that conversion tract lengths are large, with a mean of 2068 bp, and a maximum in excess of 9 kb. Despite the frequent formation of recombination intermediates implied by the rapid observed gene conversion activity, resolution via crossover is rare: only three inversions within P6 were detected in the sample. An analysis of chimpanzee and gorilla P6 orthologs showed that the ancestral state bias has existed in all three species, and comparison of human and chimpanzee sequences with the gorilla outgroup confirmed that GC bias of the conversion process has apparently been active in both the human and chimpanzee lineages."

Humans may nonetheless share a subset of non-verbal numerical skills, available soon after birth and considered the evolutionary foundation of more complex numerical reasoning, with other animals. These skills are thought to be based on the two systems: the object file system which processes small values (< 3) and the analogue magnitude system which processes large magnitudes (> 4). Infants' ability to discriminate 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3, 2 vs. 3, but not 1 vs. 4, seems to indicate that the two systems are independent, implying that the conception of a continuous number processing system is based on precursors that appear to be interrupted at or about the number four. The findings from the study being presented here indicating that chicks are able to make a series of discriminations regarding that borderline number (1 vs. 4, 1 vs. 5, 2 vs. 4) support the hypothesis that there is continuity in the number system which processes both small and large numerousness."

Whole genome assembly projects have provided an invaluable foundation for understanding genetics in all four genera, but to date genetic studies of multiple individuals within great ape species have largely been confined to mitochondrial DNA and a small number of other loci. Here, we present a genome-wide survey of genetic variation in gorillas using a reduced representation sequencing approach, focusing on the two lowland subspecies. We identify 3,006,670 polymorphic sites in 14 individuals: 12 western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and 2 eastern lowland gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri). We find that the two species are genetically distinct, based on levels of heterozygosity and patterns of allele sharing. Focusing on the western lowland population, we observe evidence for population substructure, and a deficit of rare genetic variants suggesting a recent episode of population contraction. In western lowland gorillas, there is an elevation of variation towards telomeres and centromeres on the chromosomal scale. On a finer scale, we find substantial variation in genetic diversity, including a marked reduction close to the major histocompatibility locus, perhaps indicative of recent strong selection there. These findings suggest that despite their maintaining an overall level of genetic diversity equal to or greater than that of humans, population decline, perhaps associated with disease, has been a significant factor in recent and long-term pressures on wild gorilla populations."

This study examined the degree of anisotropy, the elongation, and primary orientation of trabecular bone in the KNM-ER 1464 Early Pleistocene hominin talus as compared with extant hominoid taxa. Modern human tali were found to have a pattern of relatively anisotropic and elongated trabeculae on the lateral aspect, which was not found in Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, or KNM-ER 1464. Trabecular anisotropy in the fossil talus most closely resembled that of the African apes except for a region of high anisotropy in the posteromedial talus. The primary orientation of trabeculae in the anteromedial region of KNM-ER 1464 was strikingly different from that of the great apes and very similar to that of modern humans in being directed parallel to the talar neck. These results suggest that, relative to that of modern humans, the anteromedial region of the KNM-ER 1464 talus may have transmitted body weight to the midfoot in a similar manner while the lateral aspect may have been subjected to more variable loading conditions.

Simian Foamy Virus in Non-Human Primates and Cross-Species Transmission to Humans in Gabon: An Emerging Zoonotic Disease in Central Africa?,"['Mouinga-Ondeme, A', 'Kazanji, M']",VIRUSES-BASEL,10.3390/v5061536,JUN 2013,4,"It is now known that all human retroviruses have a non-human primate counterpart. It has been reported that the presence of these retroviruses in humans is the result of interspecies transmission. Several authors have described the passage of a simian retrovirus, simian foamy virus (SFV), from primates to humans. To better understand this retroviral ""zoonosis"" in natural settings, we evaluated the presence of SFV in both captive and wild non-human primates and in humans at high risk, such as hunters and people bitten by a non-human primate, in Gabon, central Africa. A high prevalence of SFV was found in blood samples from non-human primates and in bush meat collected across the country. Mandrills were found to be highly infected with two distinct strains of SFV, depending on their geographical location. Furthermore, samples collected from hunters and non-human primate laboratory workers showed clear, extensive cross-species transmission of SFV. People who had been bitten by mandrills, gorillas and chimpanzees had persistent SFV infection with low genetic drift. Thus, SFV is presumed to be transmitted from non-human primates mainly through severe bites, involving contact between infected saliva and blood. In this review, we summarize and discuss our five-year observations on the prevalence and dissemination of SFV in humans and non-human primates in Gabon."

Currently, twelve polyomaviruses are known to circulate within the human population. To further examine the diversity of human polyomaviruses, we have utilized a combinatorial approach comprised of initial degenerate primer-based PCR identification and phylogenetic analysis of nonhuman primate (NHP) polyomavirus species, followed by polyomavirus-specific serological analysis of human sera. Using this approach we identified twenty novel NHP polyomaviruses: nine in great apes (six in chimpanzees, two in gorillas and one in orangutan), five in Old World monkeys and six in New World monkeys. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that only four of the nine chimpanzee polyomaviruses (six novel and three previously identified) had known close human counterparts. To determine whether the remaining chimpanzee polyomaviruses had potential human counterparts, the major viral capsid proteins (VP1) of four chimpanzee polyomaviruses were expressed in E. coli for use as antigens in enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Human serum/plasma samples from both Cote d'Ivoire and Germany showed frequent seropositivity for the four viruses. Antibody pre-adsorption-based ELISA excluded the possibility that reactivities resulted from binding to known human polyomaviruses. Together, these results support the existence of additional polyomaviruses circulating within the human population that are genetically and serologically related to existing chimpanzee polyomaviruses."

Using Escherichia coli as a model organism, we evaluated fecal bacterial transmission between banded mongoose (Mungos mungo) and humans in northern Botswana. Fecal samples were collected from banded mongoose living in protected areas (n = 87, 3 troops) and surrounding villages (n = 92, 3 troops). Human fecal waste was collected from the same environment (n = 46). Isolates were evaluated for susceptibility to 10 antibiotics. Resistant E. coli isolates from mongoose were compared to human isolates using rep-PCR fingerprinting and MLST-PCR. Antimicrobial resistant isolates were identified in 57 % of the mongoose fecal samples tested (range 31-78% among troops). At least one individual mongoose fecal sample demonstrated resistance to each tested antibiotic, and multidrug resistance was highest in the protected areas (40.9%). E. coli isolated from mongoose and human sources in this study demonstrated an extremely high degree of genetic similarity on rep-PCR (AMOVA, F (ST) = 0.0027, p = 0.18) with a similar pattern identified on MLST-PCR. Human waste may be an important source of microbial exposure to wildlife. Evidence of high levels of antimicrobial resistance even within protected areas identifies an emerging health threat and highlights the need for improved waste management in these systems."
Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 10B (TNFRSF10B): an insight from structure modeling to virtual screening for designing drug against head and neck cancer,"['Tahir, RA', 'Sehgal, SA', 'Khattak, NA', 'Khattak, JZK', 'Mir, A']",THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICAL MODELLING,10.1186/1742-4682-10-38,JUN 1 2013,2,"Background: Head and neck cancer (HNC) belongs to a group of heterogeneous disease with distinct patterns of behavior and presentation. TNFRSF10B, a tumor suppressor gene mapped on chromosome 8. Mutation in candidate gene is responsible for the loss of chromosome p arm which is frequently observed in head and neck tumors. TNFRSF10B inhibits tumor formation through apoptosis but deregulation encourages metastasis, migration and invasion of tumor cell tissues.

Results: Structural modeling was performed by employing MODELLER (9v10). A suitable template [2ZB9] was retrieved from protein databank with query coverage and sequence identity of 84% and 30% respectively. Predicted Model evaluation form Rampage revealed 93.2% residues in favoured region, 5.7% in allowed region while only 1 residue is in outlier region. ERRAT and ProSA demonstrated 51.85% overall quality with a -1.08 Z-score of predicted model. Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA 5) tool was executed to infer an evolutionary history of TNFRSF10B candidate gene. Orthologs and paralogs [TNFRSF10A & TNFRSF10D] protein sequences of TNFRSF10B gene were retrieved for developed ancestral relationship. Topology of tree presenting TNFRSF10A gene considered as outgroup. Human and gorilla shared more than 90% similarities with conserved amino acid sequence. Virtual screening approach was applied for identification of novel inhibitors. Library (Mcule) was screened for novel inhibitors and utilized the scrutinized lead compounds for protein ligand docking. Screened lead compounds were further investigated for molecular docking studies. STRING server was employed to explore protein-protein interactions of TNFRSF10B target protein. TNFSF10 protein showed highest 0.999 confidence score and selected protein-protein docking by utilizing GRAMM-X server. In-silico docking results revealed I-58, S-90 and A-62 as most active interacting residues of TNFRSF10B receptor protein with R-130, S-156 and R-130 of TNFSF10B ligand protein.

Conclusion: Current research may provide a backbone for understanding structural and functional insights of TNFRSF10B protein. The designed novel inhibitors and predicted interactions might serve to inhibit the disease. Effective in-vitro potent ligands are required which will be helpful in future to design a drug to against Head and neck cancer disease. There is an urgent need for affective drug designing of head and neck cancer and computational tools for examining candidate genes more efficiently and accurately are required."

Wild chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas have been observed to swallow rough leaves without chewing, a behavior proposed to be self-medicative and to aid control of intestinal parasites. Researchers have hypothesized that the presence of hairs on the leaf surface elicits the behavior. We investigated the acquisition and the underlying mechanisms of leaf swallowing. We provided 42 captive great apes (24 chimpanzees, six bonobos, six gorillas, and six orangutans) with both rough-surfaced and hairless plants. None of the subjects had previously been observed to engage in leaf swallowing behavior and were therefore assumed na < ve. Two chimpanzees and one bonobo swallowed rough-surfaced leaves spontaneously without chewing them. In a social setup six more chimpanzees acquired the behavior. None of the gorillas or orangutans showed leaf swallowing. Because this behavior occurred in na < ve individuals, we conclude that it is part of the behavioral repertoire of chimpanzees and bonobos. Social learning is thus not strictly required for the acquisition of leaf swallowing, but it may still facilitate its expression. The fact that apes always chewed leaves of hairless control plants before swallowing, i.e., normal feeding behavior, indicates that the surface structure of leaves is indeed a determinant for initiating leaf swallowing in apes where it occurs."
The Influence of Transect Use by Local People and Reuse of Transects for Repeated Surveys on Nesting in Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and Central Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in Southeast Cameroon,"['Tagg, N', 'Willie, J']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-013-9681-0,JUN 2013,5,"Monitoring populations of endangered species over time is necessary to guide and evaluate conservation efforts. This is particularly important for nonprotected areas that ensure connectivity between protected populations but are prone to uncontrolled hunting pressure. We investigated whether use of transects by local people and transect reuse for repeated surveys influence great ape nesting and bias results. We conducted simultaneous marked nest count surveys over 12 mo on established and newly opened transects in a nonprotected area subject to traditional heavy use by local people and recorded forest composition and signs of human activity. Chimpanzee and gorilla density estimates and encounter rates per kilometer were lower on established transects than on new ones. A generalized linear model indicated that hunting activity, distance to a regularly used forest trail, and transect type (old or new) predicted chimpanzee nest abundance, and distance to the trail and transect type predicted gorilla nest abundance, with no effect of habitat type (percentage suitable habitat) for either species. We, therefore, suggest that the difference in great ape nesting is a result of high levels of hunting by local people on established transects and forest trails. Our results support the use of repeated line transect surveys for monitoring great ape populations in many circumstances, although we advocate taking precautions in nonprotected areas, to avoid the bias imposed by use of established transects for hunting."
The genome sequencing of an albino Western lowland gorilla reveals inbreeding in the wild,"['Prado-Martinez, J', 'Hernando-Herraez, I', 'Lorente-Galdos, B', 'Dabad, M', 'Ramirez, O', 'Baeza-Delgado, C', 'Morcillo-Suarez, C', 'Alkan, C', 'Hormozdiari, F', 'Raineri, E', 'Estelle, J', 'Fernandez-Callejo, M', 'Valles, M', 'Ritscher, L', 'Schoneberg, T', 'de la Calle-Mustienes, E', 'Casillas, S', 'Rubio-Acero, R', 'Mele, M', 'Engelken, J', 'Caceres, M', 'Gomez-Skarmeta, JL', 'Gut, M', 'Bertranpetit, J', 'Gut, IG', 'Abello, T', 'Eichler, EE', 'Mingarro, I', 'Lalueza-Fox, C', 'Navarro, A', 'Marques-Bonet, T']",BMC GENOMICS,10.1186/1471-2164-14-363,MAY 31 2013,9,"Background: The only known albino gorilla, named Snowflake, was a male wild born individual from Equatorial Guinea who lived at the Barcelona Zoo for almost 40 years. He was diagnosed with non-syndromic oculocutaneous albinism, i.e. white hair, light eyes, pink skin, photophobia and reduced visual acuity. Despite previous efforts to explain the genetic cause, this is still unknown. Here, we study the genetic cause of his albinism and making use of whole genome sequencing data we find a higher inbreeding coefficient compared to other gorillas.

Results: We successfully identified the causal genetic variant for Snowflake's albinism, a non-synonymous single nucleotide variant located in a transmembrane region of SLC45A2. This transporter is known to be involved in oculocutaneous albinism type 4 (OCA4) in humans. We provide experimental evidence that shows that this amino acid replacement alters the membrane spanning capability of this transmembrane region. Finally, we provide a comprehensive study of genome-wide patterns of autozygogosity revealing that Snowflake's parents were related, being this the first report of inbreeding in a wild born Western lowland gorilla.

Conclusions: In this study we demonstrate how the use of whole genome sequencing can be extended to link genotype and phenotype in non-model organisms and it can be a powerful tool in conservation genetics (e.g., inbreeding and genetic diversity) with the expected decrease in sequencing cost."
Bushmeat hunting changes regeneration of African rainforests,"['Effiom, EO', 'Nunez-Iturri, G', 'Smith, HG', 'Ottosson, U', 'Olsson, O']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rspb.2013.0246,MAY 22 2013,20,"To assess ecological consequences of bushmeat hunting in African lowland rainforests, we compared paired sites, with high and low hunting pressure, in three areas of southeastern Nigeria. In hunted sites, populations of important seed dispersers-both small and large primates (including the Cross River gorilla, Gorilla gorilla diehli)-were drastically reduced. Large rodents were more abundant in hunted sites, even though they are hunted. Hunted and protected sites had similar mature tree communities dominated by primate-dispersed species. In protected sites, seedling communities were similar in composition to the mature trees, but in hunted sites species with other dispersal modes dominated among seedlings. Seedlings emerging 1 year after clearing of all vegetation in experimental plots showed a similar pattern to the standing seedlings. This study thus verifies the transforming effects of bushmeat hunting on plant communities of tropical forests and is one of the first studies to do so for the African continent."
The Quaternary megafaunal extinction and the fate of Neanderthals: An integrative working hypothesis,"['Hortola, P', 'Martinez-Navarro, B']",QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL,10.1016/j.quaint.2012.02.037,MAY 8 2013,5,"The last great extinction that has happened throughout the Earth's life history (the Quaternary Megafaunal Extinction) exterminated more than 178 species of the world's largest mammals. Different hypotheses to explain this extinction have been proposed, from environmental catastrophes to predator avoidance, or even volcanic activity and meteorite impact. Currently, many researchers see the Sixth Extinction as a total or partial result of past climatic changes. The mechanism of Neanderthal extinction is a controversial issue of broad interest among human palaeontologists and evolutionary biologists. This paper presents an integrative working hypothesis to elucidate this extinction, based on their killing/predation as habitual part of the competition strategy of anatomically modern humans, and in the context of the wider Quaternary Megafaunal Extinction. Following this working hypothesis, Neanderthal extinction should be seen as being a mere branch of the Quaternary Megafaunal Extinction. The ecologically K early Homo sapiens would exterminate other K species, most of them megafauna, including the medium-sized non-sapiens human species. Neanderthals were part of the large mammal prey potentially hunted by our species, in the same way that historically orang-utans, gorillas and chimpanzees still are. Most probably, the same happened whenever a technologically more evolved Homo species overlapped with other less technologically evolved one. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved."

Does habitat disturbance increase infectious disease risk for primates?,"['Young, H', 'Griffin, RH', 'Wood, CL', 'Nunn, CL']",ECOLOGY LETTERS,10.1111/ele.12094,MAY 2013,20,"Many studies have suggested that ecosystem conservation protects human and wildlife populations against infectious disease. We tested this hypothesis using data on primates and their parasites. First, we tested for relationships between species' resilience to human disturbance and their parasite richness, prevalence and immune defences, but found no associations. We then conducted a meta-analysis of the effects of disturbance on parasite prevalence, which revealed no overall effect, but a positive effect for one of four types of parasites (indirectly transmitted parasites). Finally, we conducted intraspecific analyses of malaria prevalence as a function of mammalian species richness in chimpanzees and gorillas, and an interspecific analysis of geographic overlap and parasite species richness, finding that higher levels of host richness favoured greater parasite risk. These results suggest that anthropogenic effects on disease transmission are complex, and highlight the need to define the conditions under which environmental change will increase or decrease disease transmission."
"The Relationships Among Jaw-Muscle Fiber Architecture, Jaw Morphology, and Feeding Behavior in Extant Apes and Modern Humans","['Taylor, AB', 'Vinyard, CJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22260,MAY 2013,6,"The jaw-closing muscles are responsible for generating many of the forces and movements associated with feeding. Muscle physiologic cross-sectional area (PCSA) and fiber length are two architectural parameters that heavily influence muscle function. While there have been numerous comparative studies of hominoid and hominin craniodental and mandibular morphology, little is known about hominoid jaw-muscle fiber architecture. We present novel data on masseter and temporalis internal muscle architecture for small-and large-bodied hominoids. Hominoid scaling patterns are evaluated and compared with representative New- (Cebus) and Old-World (Macaca) monkeys. Variation in hominoid jaw-muscle fiber architecture is related to both absolute size and allometry. PCSAs scale close to isometry relative to jaw length in anthropoids, but likely with positive allometry in hominoids. Thus, large-bodied apes may be capable of generating both absolutely and relatively greater muscle forces compared with smaller-bodied apes and monkeys. Compared with extant apes, modern humans exhibit a reduction in masseter PCSA relative to condyle-M-1 length but retain relatively long fibers, suggesting humans may have sacrificed relative masseter muscle force during chewing without appreciably altering muscle excursion/contraction velocity. Lastly, craniometric estimates of PCSAs underestimate hominoid masseter and temporalis PCSAs by more than 50% in gorillas, and overestimate masseter PCSA by as much as 30% in humans. These findings underscore the difficulty of accurately estimating jaw-muscle fiber architecture from craniometric measures and suggest models of fossil hominin and hominoid bite forces will be improved by incorporating architectural data in estimating jaw-muscle forces.

NPY has been implicated in learning and memory and the density of NPY-expressing cortical neurons and axons is reduced in depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. Due to the role that NPY plays in both cognition and neurodegenerative diseases, we tested the hypothesis that the density of cortical and interstitial neurons expressing NPY was increased in humans relative to other primate species. The study sample included great apes (chimpanzee and gorilla), Old World monkeys (pigtailed macaque, moor macaque, and baboon) and New World monkeys (squirrel monkey and capuchin). Stereologic methods were used to estimate the density of NPY-immunoreactive (-ir) neurons in layers I-VI of area Tpt and the subjacent white matter. Adjacent Nissl-stained sections were used to calculate local densities of all neurons. The ratio of NPY-ir neurons to total neurons within area Tpt and the total density of NPY-ir neurons within the white matter were compared among species. Overall, NPY-ir neurons represented only an average of 0.006% of the total neuron population. While there were significant differences among species, phylogenetic trends in NPY-ir neuron distributions were not observed and humans did not differ from other primates. However, variation among species warrants further investigation into the distribution of this neuromodulator system. Am. J. Primatol. 75:415-424, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

At present, however, data on how brain size changes over the course of development are only available from chimpanzees and modern humans. In this study, we examined brain growth in wild Virunga mountain gorillas using data derived from necropsy reports (N = 34) and endocranial volume (EV) measurements (N = 86). The youngest individual in our sample was a 10-day-old neonatal male with a brain mass of 208 g, representing 42% of the adult male average. Our results demonstrate that Virunga mountain gorillas reach maximum adult-like brain mass by 3-4 years of age; adult-sized EV is reached by the time the first permanent molars emerge. This is in contrast to the pattern observed in chimpanzees, which despite their smaller absolute brain size, reportedly attain adult brain mass approximately 1 year later than Virunga mountain gorillas. Our findings demonstrate that brain growth is completed early in Virunga mountain gorillas compared to other great apes studied thus far, in a manner that appears to be linked with other life history characteristics of this population.

Studying the impact of such structural variations on defined molecular processes can provide valuable insights on how genome structural organization contributes to organismal evolution. Here, we show that telomeres on chromosome arms carrying subtelomeric heterochromatic caps in the chimpanzee, which are completely absent in humans, replicate later than telomeres on chromosome arms without caps. In gorilla, on the other hand, a proportion of the subtelomeric heterochromatic caps present in most chromosome arms are associated with large blocks of telomere-like sequences that follow a replication program different from that of bona fide telomeres. Strikingly, telomere-containing RNA accumulates extrachromosomally in gorilla mitotic cells, suggesting that at least some aspects of telomere-containing RNA biogenesis have diverged in gorilla, perhaps in concert with the evolution of heterochromatic caps in this species."
Initiation of Joint Attention is Associated with Morphometric Variation in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex of Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Hopkins, WD', 'Taglialatela, JP', 'AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22120,MAY 2013,5,"In developing human children, joint attention (JA) is an important preverbal skill fundamental to the development of language. Poor JA skills have been described as a behavioral risk factor for some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder. It has been hypothesized that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays an important role in the development of JA in human children. Here, we tested whether the morphometry and lateralization of the ACC differed between chimpanzees that were classified as either consistently or inconsistently engaging in JA with a human experimenter. Results showed that chimpanzees that performed poorly on the JA task had larger gray matter (GM) volumes in the ACC compared to apes that performed well on the task. In addition, both population-level asymmetries and sex differences in the volume of GM were found within the ACC. Specifically, females had relatively larger GM volumes in two of the three subregions of the ACC compared to males, and significant leftward asymmetries were found for two of the subregions whereas a rightward bias was observed in the third. Based on these findings, we suggest that the ACC plays an important role in mediating JA, not just in humans, but also chimpanzees. We further suggest that the differences found between groups may reflect inherent differences in the amount of white matter within the ACC, thereby suggesting reduced connectivity between the ACC and other cortical regions in chimpanzees with poor JA skills.

In 2008, a new exhibit was constructed to house and display a group of six proboscis monkey males born in Singapore Zoo. To document and monitor the all-male group establishment in the new exhibit, we conducted observations on intragroup interactions between the monkeys, spatial use of their new exhibit, and visitor effects on their behavior. We found contact aggressive interactions between the monkeys to be consistently lower than noncontact aggressive interactions and by week six of introduction to the new exhibit, contact aggression was almost nonevident. Affiliative interactions also developed between individuals in the group, with an interface of aggressive and socioreconcilatory behavior influenced by food competition and a dominance hierarchy. This was evident from significantly higher overall aggression and affiliation during feeding times compared to nonfeeding times, and this was reduced when food competition was mitigated by modifying the feeding regime. We measured the groups' spatial use of the exhibit and the relation to behavior, crowd size, and density. Our results showed that the proboscis monkeys utilized the available exhibit space, were largely unaffected by visitor crowd size and density, and were able to exhibit a variety of natural behaviors, including swimming. Our accomplishment in maintaining and displaying an all-male group of proboscis monkeys in captivity provides viable options for more comprehensive captive management and breeding programs for this endangered species.

However, little research has been conducted to determine how they know what is or is not relevant in the instances in which they quantify stimuli. We assessed how four chimpanzees chose between two sets of food items when the items were distributed across separate spatial arrays. Each item was covered by a container, and then was revealed in sequence so that neither whole set was visible at one time. After all containers were revealed, some were revealed again. The chimpanzees should have ignored items that were seen a second time and instead enumerated each item only once. In another test, some of the items were transposed in location and then uncovered again. Here, the chimpanzees needed to recognize that the newly shown food items were ones they already had seen. Overall, the chimpanzees were successful in selecting the truly larger array of items despite these potential distracting representations of items. Discrimination performance also reflected analogue magnitude estimation because comparisons of sets that differed by larger amounts were easier than comparisons that differed by smaller amounts. Thus, chimpanzee quantity judgments for nonvisible sets of items are inexact, but they include an aspect of control for determining when items are uniquely presented versus represented.

Object Permanence in Domestic Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and Gray Wolves (Canis lupus),"['Fiset, S', 'Plourde, V']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0030595,MAY 2013,5,"Recent evidence suggests that phylogenetic constraints exerted on dogs by the process of domestication have altered the ability of dogs to represent the physical world and the displacement of objects. In this study, invisible (Experiment 1) and visible (Experiment 2) displacement problems were administered to determine whether domestic dogs' and gray wolves' cognitive capacities to infer the position of a hidden object differ. The results revealed that adult dogs and wolves performed similarly in searching for disappearing objects: Both species succeeded the visible displacement tasks but failed the invisible displacement problems. We conclude that physical cognition for finding hidden objects in domestic dogs and gray wolves is alike and unrelated to the process of domestication."

The EEA represents a multitude of different geographic and temporal environments, of which a large number often need to be surveyed in order to draw sound conclusions. We examine a large number of both hunter-gatherer (N = 20) and historical (N = 43) infant and child mortality rates to generate a reliable quantitative estimate of their levels in the EEA. Using data drawn from a wide range of geographic locations, cultures, and times, we estimate that approximately 27% of infants failed to survive their first year of life, while approximately 47.5% of children failed to survive to puberty across in the EEA. These rates represent a serious selective pressure faced by humanity that may be underappreciated by many evolutionary psychologists. Additionally, a cross-species comparison found that human child mortality rates are roughly equivalent to Old World monkeys, higher than orangutan or bonobo rates and potentially higher than those of chimpanzees and gorillas. These findings are briefly discussed in relation to life history theory and evolved adaptations designed to lower high childhood mortality. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Assessing the prevalence and characteristics of hair-plucking behaviour in captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Less, EH', 'Kuhar, CW', 'Lukas, KE']",ANIMAL WELFARE,10.7120/09627286.22.2.175,MAY 2013,3,"Non-human primates occasionally exhibit behaviours thought to occur only in captivity that are considered abnormal. In particular, hair-plucking behaviour occurs across many species of mammals and birds. This study was the first to assess the phenomenology, demography and aetiology of this behaviour in captive gorillas across the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) population. A survey was sent to 52 AZA institutions housing western lowland gorillas. Hair-plucking behaviour occurred in 15% of the surveyed population with 62% of institutions housing a hair plucker. Individuals were most likely to self-pluck using their fingers. Individuals that were exposed as youngsters to a hair-plucking group member were significantly more likely to develop the behaviour themselves. There was also a trend toward solitary individuals being more likely to perform this behaviour. Future research needs include identifying hormonal correlates to this behaviour, understanding its relationship to acute or chronic stressors, and examining what causes this behaviour to fluctuate in frequency once it has developed."

Despite the magnitude of this reservoir, it is unknown whether apes represent a source of human infections. Here, we used Plasmodium species-specific PCR, single-genome amplification, and 454 sequencing to screen humans from remote areas of southern Cameroon for ape Laverania infections. Among 1,402 blood samples, we found 1,000 to be Plasmodium mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) positive, all of which contained human parasites as determined by sequencing and/or restriction enzyme digestion. To exclude low-abundance infections, we subjected 514 of these samples to 454 sequencing, targeting a region of the mtDNA genome that distinguishes ape from human Laverania species. Using algorithms specifically developed to differentiate rare Plasmodium variants from 454-sequencing error, we identified single and mixed-species infections with P. falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, and/or Plasmodium ovale. However, none of the human samples contained ape Laverania parasites, including the gorilla precursor of P. falciparum. To characterize further the diversity of P. falciparum in Cameroon, we used single-genome amplification to amplify 3.4-kb mtDNA fragments from 229 infected humans. Phylogenetic analysis identified 62 new variants, all of which clustered with extant P. falciparum, providing further evidence that P. falciparum emerged following a single gorilla-to-human transmission. Thus, unlike Plasmodium knowlesi-infected macaques in southeast Asia, African apes harboring Laverania parasites do not seem to serve as a recurrent source of human malaria, a finding of import to ongoing control and eradication measures."
A review of the medicinal potentials of plants of the genus Vernonia (Asteraceae),"['Toyang, NJ', 'Verpoorte, R']",JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY,10.1016/j.jep.2013.01.040,APR 19 2013,22,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: The Vernonia genus has about one thousand species and members of the genus are widely used as food and medicine. The aim of this review is to analyze published data on the ethnomedicinal, ethnoveterinary and zoopharmacognostic uses of plants of the Vernonia genus. This will help to identify the state of ethnopharmacological knowledge in regard to this genus and to propose future research priorities.

Materials and methods: The major scientific databases including SciFinder, Sciencedirect, Medline and Google Scholar were queried for information on Vernonia genus using various keyword combinations. The International Plant Name Index was also used to verify the names of species and authors.

Results: A total of 109 Vernonia species were reported in the literature to have medicinal properties. One hundred and five (105) plants were linked to the treatment or management of 44 human diseases or health conditions. Plants of the genus also feature in ethnoveterinary and zoopharmacognostic practices. A total of 12 vernonia species were identified to be used in ethnoveterinary medicine while 2 species are used in self medication practices by chimpanzees and gorillas. In vitro and in vivo research studies reporting the validation of the medicinal properties of some species were also reviewed. One hundred and three bioactive compounds isolated from various Vernonia species were also identified. Vernonia amygdalina was identified as the most frequently used member of the Vernonia genus. The Vernolides, a class of sesquiterpene lactone were identified as the most studied compounds from the genus and show interesting bioactivity in antiplasmodial, antileishmanial, antischistosomial, cytotoxicity, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory assays.

Conclusion: On the basis of results from a combination of in vitro and in vivo efficacy and toxicity studies reported, Vernonia amygdalina holds the most promise for development into a nutraceutical against diabetes and malaria while Vernonia cinerea has potential against cancer and inflammatory conditions. Vernolide A is so far the most promising single agent from a Vernonia species that has potential for development into an anticancer agent. The other Vernonia species and isolated compounds require further studies to ascertain their medicinal potentials. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
Measurements of Salivary Alpha Amylase and Salivary Cortisol in Hominoid Primates Reveal Within-Species Consistency and Between-Species Differences,"['Behringer, V', 'Borchers, C', 'Deschner, T', 'Mostl, E', 'Selzer, D', 'Hohmann, G']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0060773,APR 17 2013,5,"Salivary alpha amylase (sAA) is the most abundant enzyme in saliva. Studies in humans found variation in enzymatic activity of sAA across populations that could be linked to the copy number of loci for salivary amylase (AMY1), which was seen as an adaptive response to the intake of dietary starch. In addition to diet dependent variation, differences in sAA activity have been related to social stress. In a previous study, we found evidence for stress-induced variation in sAA activity in the bonobos, a hominoid primate that is closely related to humans. In this study, we explored patterns of variation in sAA activity in bonobos and three other hominoid primates, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan to (a) examine if within-species differences in sAA activity found in bonobos are characteristic for hominoids and (b) assess the extent of variation in sAA activity between different species. The results revealed species-differences in sAA activity with gorillas and orangutans having higher basal sAA activity when compared to Pan. To assess the impact of stress, sAA values were related to cortisol levels measured in the same saliva samples. Gorillas and orangutans had low salivary cortisol concentrations and the highest cortisol concentration was found in samples from male bonobos, the group that also showed the highest sAA activity. Considering published information, the differences in sAA activity correspond with differences in AMY1 copy numbers and match with general features of natural diet. Studies on sAA activity have the potential to complement molecular studies and may contribute to research on feeding ecology and nutrition."

Although this seems to be supported by studies on a range of domesticated (including dogs, goats and horses) and wild (including wolves and chimpanzees) animals, there is also evidence that exposure to humans positively influences the ability of both wild and domesticated animals to follow these same cues. Here, we test the performance of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) on an object choice task that provides them with visual-only cues given by humans about the location of hidden food. Captive elephants are interesting candidates for investigating how both domestication and human exposure may impact cue-following as they represent a non-domesticated species with almost constant human interaction. As a group, the elephants (n = 7) in our study were unable to follow pointing, body orientation or a combination of both as honest signals of food location. They were, however, able to follow vocal commands with which they were already familiar in a novel context, suggesting the elephants are able to follow cues if they are sufficiently salient. Although the elephants' inability to follow the visual cues provides partial support for the domestication hypothesis, an alternative explanation is that elephants may rely more heavily on other sensory modalities, specifically olfaction and audition. Further research will be needed to rule out this alternative explanation."

Because the MHC is subject to extensive variation, both structural and sequence-wise, it is not readily amenable to study in whole genome shotgun sequence such as the recently published gorilla genome. The variation of the MHC also makes it of evolutionary interest and therefore we analyse the sequence in the context of human and chimpanzee. In our comparisons with human and re-annotated chimpanzee MHC sequence we find that gorilla has a trimodular RCCX cluster, versus the reference human bimodular cluster, and additional copies of Class I (pseudo) genes between Gogo-K and Gogo-A (the orthologues of HLA-K and -A). We also find that Gogo-H (and Patr-H) is coding versus the HLA-H pseudogene and, conversely, there is a Gogo-DQB2 pseudogene versus the HLA-DQB2 coding gene. Our analysis, which is freely available through the VEGA genome browser, provides the research community with a comprehensive dataset for comparative and evolutionary research of the MHC."

The new nonmetric data are then qualitatively and phenetically compared with those in eight other African hominin samples, before cladistic analyses using a gorilla outgroup. There is some distinction, largely driven by contrasting molar traits, from East African australopiths. However, Au. sediba links with Au. africanus to form a South African australopith clade. These species present five apomorphies, including shared expressions of Carabelli's upper first molar (UM1) and protostylid lower first molar (LM1). Five synapomorphies are also evident between them and monophyletic Homo habilis/rudolfensis + H. erectus. Finally, a South African australopith + Homo clade is supported by four shared derived states, including identical LM1 cusp 7 expression."

Brain macroscopic changes by MRI investigation during aging were observed in humans and dogs but chimpanzees did not display significant changes. This suggestion led to the statement that brain aging is different in various species. Although human brain changes, e. g. beta-amyloid storage, neurofibrillary tangle formation, lipofuscin, are relatively well known, we are still looking for a suitable animal model to study the mechanisms of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this paper presents a comparative analysis of the changes described in the brains of senile dog, horse and gorilla. In addition we present the latest, non-invasive methods that can be applied in the diagnosis of old age in mammals. Our considerations have shown that the best animal model for further studies and observations on aging is the dog."

The precision of the hominid timescale estimated by relaxed clock methods,"['Schrago, CG', 'Voloch, CM']",JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1111/jeb.12076,APR 2013,5,"The chronological scenario of the evolution of hominoid primates has been thoroughly investigated since the advent of the molecular clock hypothesis. With the availability of genomic sequences for all hominid genera and other anthropoids, we may have reached the point at which the information from sequence data alone will not provide further evidence for the inference of the hominid evolution timescale. To verify this conjecture, we have compiled a genomic data set for all of the anthropoid genera. Our estimate places the Homo/Pan divergence at approximately 7.4Ma, the Gorilla lineage divergence at approximately 9.7Ma, the basal Hominidae divergence at 18.1Ma and the basal Hominoidea divergence at 20.6Ma. By inferring the theoretical limit distribution of posterior densities under a Bayesian framework, we show that it is unlikely that lengthier alignments or the availability of new genomic sequences will provide additional information to reduce the uncertainty associated with the divergence time estimates of the four hominid genera. A reduction of this uncertainty will be achieved only by the inclusion of more informative calibration priors."
Comparative Population Genomics of the Ejaculate in Humans and the Great Apes,"['Good, JM', 'Wiebe, V', 'Albert, FW', 'Burbano, HA', 'Kircher, M', 'Green, RE', 'Halbwax, M', 'Andre, C', 'Atencia, R', 'Fischer, A', 'Paabo, S']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/mst005,APR 2013,15,"The rapid molecular evolution of reproductive genes is nearly ubiquitous across animals, yet the selective forces and functional targets underlying this divergence remain poorly understood. Humans and closely related species of great apes show strongly divergent mating systems, providing a powerful system to investigate the influence of sperm competition on the evolution of reproductive genes. This is complemented by detailed information on male reproductive biology and unparalleled genomic resources in humans. Here, we have used custom microarrays to capture and sequence 285 genes encoding proteins present in the ejaculate as well as 101 randomly selected control genes in 21 gorillas, 20 chimpanzees, 20 bonobos, and 20 humans. In total, we have generated > 25x average genomic coverage per individual for over 1 million target base pairs. Our analyses indicate high levels of evolutionary constraint across much of the ejaculate combined with more rapid evolution of genes involved in immune defense and proteolysis. We do not find evidence for appreciably more positive selection along the lineage leading to bonobos and chimpanzees, although this would be predicted given more intense sperm competition in these species. Rather, the extent of positive and negative selection depended more on the effective population sizes of the species. Thus, general patterns of male reproductive protein evolution among apes and humans depend strongly on gene function but not on inferred differences in the intensity of sperm competition among extant species."
"Distribution of a Community of Mammals in Relation to Roads and Other Human Disturbances in Gabon, Central Africa","['Vanthomme, H', 'Kolowski, J', 'Korte, L', 'Alonso, A']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/cobi.12017,APR 2013,9,"We present the first community-level study of the associations of both roads and other human disturbances with the distribution of mammals in Gabon (central Africa). Our study site was in an oil concession within a littoral mosaic landscape. We conducted surveys along 199 line transects and installed camera traps on 99 of these transects to document mammal presence and abundance. We used generalized linear mixed-effect models to document associations between variables related to the ecosystem (land cover, topography, and hydrology), roads (coating, width of rights of way, condition, type of vehicle used on the road, traffic level, affiliation of users, and general type of road), and other human disturbances (urbanization, agriculture, hunting, logging, gathering, and industrial activities) and the abundance or presence of 17 species or groups of mammals including elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), buffalo (Syncerus caffer), sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekei), red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), smaller ungulates, gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), side-striped jackal (Canis adustus), carnivores, monkeys, and large rodents. Some types of roads and other human disturbances were negatively associated with the abundance or presence of elephants, buffalos, gorillas, sitatungas, some monkeys, and duikers. The pattern of associations of mammals with roads and other human disturbances was diverse and included positive associations with road presence (red river hog, some monkeys, and duikers), agriculture (sitatunga, small carnivores, and large rodents) and industrial activities (sitatunga, red river hog, red duikers, and side-striped jackal). Our results suggest that the community of mammals we studied was mostly affected by hunting, agriculture, and urbanization, which are facilitated by road presence. We recommend increased regulation of agriculture, hunting, and road building in the area."
A Comparison of Qualitative and Quantitative Methodological Approaches to Characterizing the Dorsal Side of the Scapula in Hominoidea and Its Relationship to Locomotion,"['Bello-Hellegouarch, G', 'Potau, JM', 'Arias-Martorell, J', 'Pastor, JF', 'Perez-Perez, A']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-013-9660-5,APR 2013,9,"Hominoidea have adapted to various forms of locomotion, each of which has specific requirements that are reflected in the shape of the scapula. We compared several qualitative and quantitative methods for characterizing the dorsal side of the scapula to detect morphological differences that reflect the adaptations of the scapula to locomotor behaviors. Our sample included 55 specimens of Hominoidea, representing five genera, including Homo, focusing specifically on the relative sizes of the scapular supraspinous and infranspinous fossae. In addition, we weighed the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles of 23 of the specimens to examine the feasibility of extrapolating muscle characteristics from osteological data. Our findings confirmed that the five genera exhibit significant differences in the relative size of the supraspinous and the infraspinous fossae that are related to their forms of locomotion. The supraspinous fossa was relatively small in Homo and Pongo but large in Pan, Gorilla, and Hylobates. The analysis of muscle weights showed that a substantial amount of information about soft tissues is lost in osteological analyses, leading us to recommend caution when drawing conclusions regarding forms of locomotion based only on osteological analyses."
Sexual Dimorphism and Facial Growth Beyond Dental Maturity in Great Apes and Gibbons,"['Balolia, KL', 'Soligo, C', 'Lockwood, CA']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-013-9666-z,APR 2013,2,"The great apes and gibbons are characterized by extensive variation in degree of body size and cranial dimorphism, but although some studies have investigated how sexual dimorphism in body mass is attained in these species, for the majority of taxa concerned, no corresponding work has explored the full extent of how sexual dimorphism is attained in the facial skeleton. In addition, most studies of sexual dimorphism combine dentally mature individuals into a single ""adult"" category, thereby assuming that no substantial changes in size or dimorphism take place after dental maturity. We investigated degree and pattern of male and female facial growth in Pan troglodytes troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, and Hylobates lar after dental maturity through cross-sectional analyses of linear measurements and geometric mean values of the facial skeleton and age-ranking of individuals based on molar occlusal wear. Results show that overall facial size continues to increase after dental maturity is reached in males and females of Gorilla gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus, as well as in the females of Hylobates lar. In male Pongo pygmaeus, adult growth patterns imply the presence of a secondary growth spurt in craniofacial dimensions. There is suggestive evidence of growth beyond dental maturity in the females of Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Pan paniscus, but not in the males of those species. The results show the presence of statistically significant facial size dimorphism in young adults of Pan paniscus and Hylobates lar, and of near statistical significance in Pan troglodytes troglodytes, but not in older adults of those species; adults of Gorilla gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus are sexually dimorphic at all ages after dental maturity. The presence of sex-specific growth patterns in these hominoid taxa indicates a complex relationship between socioecological selective pressures and growth of the facial skeleton."
Humeral Cross-Sectional Shape in Suspensory Primates and Sloths,"['Patel, BA', 'Ruff, CB', 'Simons, ELR', 'Organ, JM']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.22669,APR 2013,2,"Studies on the cross-sectional geometry of long bones in African apes have documented that shape ratios derived from second moments of area about principle axes (e.g., Imax/Imin) are often correlated with habitual locomotor behaviors. For example, humeral cross-sections tend to appear more circular in more arboreal and forelimb suspensory chimpanzees compared with terrestrial quadrupedal gorillas. These data support the hypothesis that cross-sections that are more circular in shape are adapted for multidirectional loading regimes and bending moments encountered when using acrobatic locomotor behaviors. Whether a more circular humerus reflects greater use of forelimb suspension in other primates and nonprimate mammals is unknown. In this study, cross-sections at or near midshaft of the humerus were obtained from anthropoid primates that differ in their use of forelimb suspension, as well as from two genera of suspensory sloths. Imax/Imin ratios were compared within and between groups, and correlations were made with behavioral data. In broad comparisons, observed differences in morphology follow predicted patterns. Humeri of suspensory sloths are circular. Humeri of the more suspensory hominoids tend to be more circular than those of quadrupedal taxa. Humeri of the suspensory atelines are similar to hominoids, while those of Cebus are more like nonsuspensory cercopithecoids. There is, however, considerable overlap between taxa and within finer comparisons variation between species are not in the predicted direction. Thus, although Imax/Imin ratios of the humerus are informative for characterizing generalized locomotor modes (i.e., forelimb suspensory vs. quadrupedal), additional structural information is needed for more fine-grained assessments of locomotion.

Neandertal Origin of Genetic Variation at the Cluster of OAS Immunity Genes,"['Mendez, FL', 'Watkins, JC', 'Hammer, MF']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/mst004,APR 2013,21,"Analyses of ancient DNA from extinct humans reveal signals of at least two independent hybridization events in the history of non-African populations. To date, there are very few examples of specific genetic variants that have been rigorously identified as introgressive. Here, we survey DNA sequence variation in the OAS gene cluster on chromosome 12 and provide strong evidence that a haplotype extending for similar to 185 kb introgressed from Neandertals. This haplotype is nearly restricted to Eurasians and is estimated to have diverged from the Neandertal sequence similar to 125 kya. Despite the potential for novel functional variation, the observed frequency of this haplotype is consistent with neutral introgression. This is the second locus in the human genome, after STAT2, carrying distinct haplotypes that appear to have introgressed separately from both Neandertals and Denisova."

A series of visible and invisible displacement tasks with suitable controls were presented to five adult subjects. Subjects performed significantly above chance on all regular tasks, except for the double invisible displacements. Subjects failed visible and invisible controls. Failure on the control trials did not appear to be because subjects used the last box touched strategy (subjects did not choose the last box touched significantly more than expected by chance). However, a substantial percentage of choices was made to the last box touched by the experimenter. There was no significant difference between this percentage, and the percentage of choices made to the baited box (on both visible and invisible controls), which indicates that subjects were drawn to both boxes which the experimenter visited/touched, and thus failed the controls. Based on the results from the present study, we believe that there is no evidence that black-and-white ruffed lemurs understand visible and invisible tasks in the traditional object permanence battery.

Head-Mounted Eye Tracking of a Chimpanzee under Naturalistic Conditions,"['Kano, F', 'Tomonaga, M']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0059785,MAR 27 2013,5,"This study offers a new method for examining the bodily, manual, and eye movements of a chimpanzee at the micro-level. A female chimpanzee wore a lightweight head-mounted eye tracker (60 Hz) on her head while engaging in daily interactions with the human experimenter. The eye tracker recorded her eye movements accurately while the chimpanzee freely moved her head, hands, and body. Three video cameras recorded the bodily and manual movements of the chimpanzee from multiple angles. We examined how the chimpanzee viewed the experimenter in this interactive setting and how the eye movements were related to the ongoing interactive contexts and actions. We prepared two experimentally defined contexts in each session: a face-to-face greeting phase upon the appearance of the experimenter in the experimental room, and a subsequent face-to-face task phase that included manual gestures and fruit rewards. Overall, the general viewing pattern of the chimpanzee, measured in terms of duration of individual fixations, length of individual saccades, and total viewing duration of the experimenter's face/body, was very similar to that observed in previous eye-tracking studies that used non-interactive situations, despite the differences in the experimental settings. However, the chimpanzee viewed the experimenter and the scene objects differently depending on the ongoing context and actions. The chimpanzee viewed the experimenter's face and body during the greeting phase, but viewed the experimenter's face and hands as well as the fruit reward during the task phase. These differences can be explained by the differential bodily/manual actions produced by the chimpanzee and the experimenter during each experimental phase (i.e., greeting gestures, task cueing). Additionally, the chimpanzee's viewing pattern varied depending on the identity of the experimenter (i.e., the chimpanzee's prior experience with the experimenter). These methods and results offer new possibilities for examining the natural gaze behavior of chimpanzees."
The transmembrane domain of HIV-1 Vpu is sufficient to confer anti-tetherin activity to SIVcpz and SIVgor Vpu proteins: cytoplasmic determinants of Vpu function,"['Kluge, SF', 'Sauter, D', 'Vogl, M', 'Peeters, M', 'Li, YY', 'Bibollet-Ruche, F', 'Hahn, BH', 'Kirchhoff, F']",RETROVIROLOGY,10.1186/1742-4690-10-32,MAR 20 2013,5,"Background: The acquisition of effective Vpu-mediated anti-tetherin activity to promote virion release following transmission of SIVcpzPtt from central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) to humans distinguishes pandemic HIV-1 group M strains from non-pandemic group N, O and P viruses and may have been a prerequisite for their global spread. Some functional motifs in the cytoplasmic region of HIV-1 M Vpus proposed to be important for anti-tetherin activity are more frequently found in the Vpu proteins of SIVcpzPtt than in those of SIVcpzPts infecting eastern chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii), that have not been detected in humans, and SIVgor from gorillas, which is closely related to HIV-1 O and P. Thus, SIVcpzPtt strains may require fewer adaptive changes in Vpu than SIVcpzPts or SIVgor strains to counteract human tetherin.

Results: To examine whether SIVcpzPtt may only need changes in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of Vpu to acquire anti-tetherin activity, whereas SIVcpzPts and SIVgor may also require changes in the cytoplasmic region, we analyzed chimeras between the TMD of an HIV-1 M Vpu and the cytoplasmic domains of SIVcpzPtt (n = 2), SIVcpzPts (n = 2) and SIVgor (n = 2) Vpu proteins. Unexpectedly, all of these chimeras were capable of counteracting human tetherin to enhance virion release, irrespective of the presence or absence of the putative adaptor protein binding sites and the DSGxxS beta-TrCP binding motif reported to be critical for effective anti-tetherin activity of M Vpus. It was also surprising that in three of the six chimeras the gain of anti-tetherin function was associated with a loss of the CD4 degradation activity since this function was conserved among all parental HIV-1, SIVcpz and SIVgor Vpu proteins.

Conclusions: Our results show that changes in the TMD of SIVcpzPtt, SIVcpzPts and SIVgor Vpus are sufficient to render them active against human tetherin. Thus, several previously described domains in the extracellular region of Vpu are not absolutely essential for tetherin antagonism but may be required for other Vpu functions."

In addition, most of them are endangered. For these reasons, non-invasive sampling is especially useful in primates including lemurs. A key issue in conservation and ecological studies is to identify the sex of the sampled individuals to investigate sex-biased dispersal, parentage, social organization and population sex ratio. Several molecular tests of sex are available in apes and monkeys, but only a handful of them work in the lemuriform clade. Among these tests, the coamplification of the SRY gene with the amelogenin X gene using strepsirhine-specific X primers seems particularly promising, but the reliability and validity of this sexing test have not been properly assessed yet. In this study, we (i) show that this molecular sexing test works on three additional lemur species (Microcebus tavaratra, Propithecus coronatus and P. verreauxi) from two previously untested genera and one previously untested family, suggesting that these markers are likely to be universal among lemurs and other strepsirrhines; (ii) provide the first evidence that this PCR-based sexing test works on degraded DNA obtained from noninvasive samples; (iii) validate the approach using a large number of known-sex individuals and a multiple-tubes approach, and show that mismatches between the field sex and the final molecular consensus sex occur in less than 10% of all the samples and that most of these mismatches were likely linked to incorrect sex determinations in the field rather than genotyping errors.

Study design Case series.

Animals Six gorillas, two males and four females, aged 9-52 years and weighing 63-155 kg.

Methods The gorillas were given zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride 0.2 +/- 0.05 mg kg(-1) per os twice daily for 3 days for premedication. On the day of anaesthesia the dose of zuclopenthixol was increased to 0.27 mg kg(-1) and given once early in the morning. Anaesthesia was induced with medetomidine 0.04 +/- 0.004 mg kg(-1), midazolam 0.048 +/- 0.003 mg kg(-1) and ketamine 4.9 +/- 0.4 mg kg(-1) intramuscularly (IM). Upon recumbency, the trachea was intubated and anaesthesia was maintained on 1-2% isoflurane in oxygen. Physiological parameters were monitored every 10 minutes and arterial blood gas analysis was performed once 30-50 minutes after initial darting. At the end of the procedure, 42-115 minutes after initial darting, immobilisation was antagonized with atipamezole 0.21 +/- 0.03 mg kg(-1) and sarmazenil 5 +/- 0.4 mu g kg(-1) IM.

Results Recumbency was reached within 10 minutes in five out of six animals. One animal required two additional darts before intubation was feasible. Heart rate ranged from 60 to 85 beats minute(-1), respiratory rate from 17 to 46 breaths minute(-1) and temperature from 36.9 to 38.3 degrees C. No spontaneous recoveries were observed and anaesthetic level was stable. Blood gas analyses revealed mild respiratory acidosis, and mean PaO2 was 24.87 +/- 17.16 kPa (187 +/- 129 mmHg) with all values being above 13.4 kPa (101 mmHg). Recovery was smooth and gorillas were sitting within 25 minutes.

Conclusion and clinical relevance The drug combination proved to be effective in anaesthetizing captive gorillas of various ages and both sexes, with minimal cardio-respiratory changes."

Four bocavirus genotypes (HBoV1-HBoV4) have been found so far. Since there were no data on the contribution of HBoV to gastroenteritis in Russia, 1781 fecal samples collected from infants hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis in Novosibirsk, Russia during one year were tested for the presence of nucleic acids from HBoV and three major gastrointestinal viruses (rotavirus A, norovirus II, and astrovirus). HBoV was detected only in 1.9% of the samples: HBoV1 was detected in 0.6% and HBoV2, in 1.3%. Complete genome sequencing of three Novosibirsk isolates was performed. An evolutionary analysis of these sequences and the available sequences of human and great apes bocaviruses demonstrated that the current HBoV genotypes diverged comparatively recently, about 60-300 years ago. The independent evolution of bocaviruses from chimpanzees and gorillas commenced at the same time period. This suggests that these isolates of great apes bocaviruses belong to separate genotypes within the species of human bocavirus, which is actually the primate bocavirus. The rate of mutation accumulation in the genome of primate bocaviruses has been estimated as approximately 9 x 10(-4) substitutions/site/year. It has been demonstrated that HBoV1 diverged from the ancestor common with chimpanzee bocavirus approximately 60-80 years ago, while HBoV4 separated from great apes bocaviruses about 200-300 years ago. The hypothesis postulating independent evolution of HBoV1 and HBoV4 genotypes from primate bocaviruses has been proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
A scalable and flexible approach for investigating the genomic landscapes of phylogenetic incongruence,"['Prasad, AB', 'Mullikin, JC', 'Green, ED']",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.ympev.2012.11.023,MAR 2013,2,"Analyses of DNA sequence datasets have repeatedly revealed inconsistencies in phylogenetic trees derived with different data. This is termed phylogenetic incongruence, and may arise from a methodological failure of the inference process or from biological processes, such as horizontal gene transfer, incomplete lineage sorting, and introgression. To better understand patterns of incongruence, we developed a method (PartFinder) that uses likelihood ratios applied to sliding windows for visualizing tree-support changes across genome-sequence alignments, allowing the comparative examination of complex phylogenetic scenarios among many species. As a pilot, we used PartFinder to investigate incongruence in the Homo-Pan-Gorilla group as well as Platyrrhini using high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-derived sequences as well as assembled whole-genome shotgun sequences. Our simulations verified the sensitivity of PartFinder, and our results were comparable to other studies of the Homo-Pan-Gorilla group. Analyses of the whole-genome alignments reveal significant associations between support for the accepted species relationship and specific characteristics of the genomic regions, such as GC-content, alignment score, exon content, and conservation. Finally, we analyzed sequence data generated for five platyrrhine species, and found incongruence that suggests a polytomy within Cebidae, in particular. Together, these studies demonstrate the utility of PartFinder for investigating the patterns of phylogenetic incongruence. Published by Elsevier Inc."

Olive baboons communicate intentionally by pointing,"['Meunier, H', 'Prieur, J', 'Vauclair, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-012-0558-y,MAR 2013,7,"A pointing gesture creates a referential triangle that incorporates distant objects into the relationship between the signaller and the gesture's recipient. Pointing was long assumed to be specific to our species. However, recent reports have shown that pointing emerges spontaneously in captive chimpanzees and can be learned by monkeys. Studies have demonstrated that both human children and great apes use manual gestures (e.g. pointing), and visual and vocal signals, to communicate intentionally about out-of-reach objects. Our study looked at how monkeys understand and use their learned pointing behaviour, asking whether it is a conditioned, reinforcement-dependent response or whether monkeys understand it to be a mechanism for manipulating the attention of a partner (e.g. a human). We tested nine baboons that had been trained to exhibit pointing, using operant conditioning. More specifically, we investigated their ability to communicate intentionally about the location of an unreachable food reward in three contexts that differed according to the human partner's attentional state. In each context, we quantified the frequency of communicative behaviour (auditory and visual signals), including gestures and gaze alternations between the distal food and the human partner. We found that the baboons were able to modulate their manual and visual communicative signals as a function of the experimenter's attentional state. These findings indicate that monkeys can intentionally produce pointing gestures and understand that a human recipient must be looking at the pointing gesture for them to perform their attention-directing actions. The referential and intentional nature of baboons' communicative signalling is discussed."
"How selective are elephants as agents of forest tree damage in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda?","['Ssali, F', 'Sheil, D', 'Nkurunungi, JB']",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,10.1111/aje.12006,MAR 2013,2,"Elephants are locally concentrated in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Vegetation damage attributable to elephants appears to be increasing and may result in the modification of the forest. We examined the implied selectivity of stem damage due to elephants. We followed 26.84km of recent elephant trails and used 122 plots to document tree damage in relation to species, stem sizes and locations. Of 897 trees (DBH2cm), 542 (60.4%) were intact, 22 (2.5%) debarked, 274 (30.5%) toppled and 172 (19.2%) had broken branches. Small trees were more likely to be pushed over or have their branches broken, whereas large trees were more commonly debarked. The species most frequently selected for damage included mid-successional species such as Newtonia buchananii, Myrianthus holstii and Chrysophyllum albidum. These species may be vulnerable to increasing elephant numbers. Our analyses using general linear models indicate that elephants are selective concerning where, how and what tree stems they damage. We found a higher incidence of elephant damage per-tree stem in open areas than in more closed areas, suggesting feedback in which elephants maintain open habitats that may be conducive for other species such as mountain gorillas. More work is needed to better determine how changing elephant numbers may influence Bwindi's conservation values."
Density of herbaceous plants and distribution of western gorillas in different habitat types in south-east Cameroon,"['Willie, J', 'Petre, CA', 'Tagg, N', 'Lens, L']",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,10.1111/aje.12014,MAR 2013,4,"The study of forest herb availability improves knowledge of ecology and conservation of gorillas that depend on such herbs. Density patterns of herbs and location of western gorilla nest sites were studied in different habitat types at a site in south-east Cameroon to assess their relationship. Herb stems of the families Marantaceae and Zingiberaceae were identified and counted in 10,713 1-m2 plots distributed within six habitat types. Stem density correlated with light availability and ranged from 2.38stemsm2 in near primary forest to 4.66stemsm2 in light gaps. Gorillas showed marked preferences for habitats with high herb densities such as light gaps, swamps and young secondary forest. However, no clear relationship exists between terrestrial herbaceous vegetation and gorilla densities across Central Africa. It is suggested that differences in ecological factors and land use history within and between sites may explain differences in herb density and diversity which partly account for variations in the historical and present population distribution and density of western gorillas. Formerly logged and swamp forests, which are characterized by an abundance of herbs, may prove to be of great value in the conservation of western gorillas given appropriate forest management practices, adequate protection from poaching and limited human encroachment."
"Long-Term Temporal and Spatial Dynamics of Food Availability for Endangered Mountain Gorillas in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda","['Grueter, CC', 'Ndamiyabo, F', 'Plumptre, AJ', 'Abavandimwe, D', 'Mundry, R', 'Fawcett, KA', 'Robbins, MM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22102,MAR 2013,2,"Monitoring temporal and spatial changes in the resource availability of endangered species contributes to their conservation. The number of critically endangered mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in the Virunga Volcano population has doubled over the past three decades, but no studies have examined how food availability has changed during that period. First, we assessed if the plant species consumed by the gorillas have changed in abundance and distribution during the past two decades. In 20092010, we replicated a study conducted in 19881989 by measuring the frequency, density, and biomass of plant species consumed by the gorillas in 496 plots (ca. 6 km2) in the Karisoke study area in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda. We expected to observe a decreased presence of major gorilla food plants as a likely result of density-dependent overharvesting by gorillas. Among the five most frequently consumed species (composing approximately 70% of the gorilla's diet, excluding bamboo), two have decreased in availability and abundance, while three have increased. Some species have undergone shifts in their altitudinal distribution, possibly due to regional climatic changes. Second, we made baseline measurements of food availability in a larger area currently utilized by the gorillas. In the extended sampling (n = 473 plots) area (ca. 25 km2), of the five most frequently consumed species, two were not significantly different in frequency from the re-sampled area, while two occurred significantly less frequently, and one occurred significantly more frequently. We discuss the potential impact of gorilla-induced herbivory on changes of vegetation abundance. The changes in the species most commonly consumed by the gorillas could affect their nutrient intake and stresses the importance of monitoring the interrelation among plant population dynamics, species density, and resource use.

"Anopheles moucheti and Anopheles vinckei Are Candidate Vectors of Ape Plasmodium Parasites, Including Plasmodium praefalciparum in Gabon","['Paupy, C', 'Makanga, B', 'Ollomo, B', 'Rahola, N', 'Durand, P', 'Magnus, J', 'Willaume, E', 'Renaud, F', 'Fontenille, D', 'Prugnolle, F']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0057294,FEB 20 2013,7,"During the last four years, knowledge about the diversity of Plasmodium species in African great apes has considerably increased. Several new species were described in chimpanzees and gorillas, and some species that were previously considered as strictly of human interest were found to be infecting African apes. The description in gorillas of P. praefalciparum, the closest relative of P. falciparum which is the main malignant agent of human malaria, definitively changed the way we understand the evolution and origin of P. falciparum. This parasite is now considered to have appeared recently, following a cross-species transfer from gorillas to humans. However, the Plasmodium vector mosquito species that have served as bridge between these two host species remain unknown. In order to identify the vectors that ensure ape Plasmodium transmission and evaluate the risk of transfer of these parasites to humans, we carried out a field study in Gabon to capture Anopheles in areas where wild and semi-wild ape populations live. We collected 1070 Anopheles females belonging to 15 species, among which An. carnevalei, An. moucheti and An. marshallii were the most common species. Using mtDNA-based PCR tools, we discovered that An. moucheti, a major human malaria vector in Central Africa, could also ensure the natural transmission of P. praefalciparum among great apes. We also showed that, together with An. vinckei, An. moucheti was infected with P. vivax-like parasites. An. moucheti constitutes, therefore, a major candidate for the transfer of Plasmodium parasites from apes to humans."

Characterizing the facial morphological variation and craniofacial covariation patterns in extant hominids is fundamental to the understanding of their evolutionary history. Numerous studies on hominid facial shape have proposed hypotheses concerning the relationship between the anterior facial shape, facial block orientation and basicranial flexion. In this study we test these hypotheses in a sample of adult specimens belonging to three extant hominid genera (Homo, Pan and Gorilla). Intraspecific variation and covariation patterns are analyzed using geometric morphometric methods and multivariate statistics, such as partial least squared on three-dimensional landmarks coordinates. Our results indicate significant intraspecific covariation between facial shape, facial block orientation and basicranial flexion. Hominids share similar characteristics in the relationship between anterior facial shape and facial block orientation. Modern humans exhibit a specific pattern in the covariation between anterior facial shape and basicranial flexion. This peculiar feature underscores the role of modern humans' highly-flexed basicranium in the overall integration of the cranium. Furthermore, our results are consistent with the hypothesis of a relationship between the reduction of the value of the cranial base angle and a downward rotation of the facial block in modern humans, and to a lesser extent in chimpanzees."

However, the mechanisms underlying those associations remain unknown. We moved away from testing hypotheses rooted in the activities of modern humans, by testing whether these associations are ancestral and one side of a trade-off between fitness costs and benefits. We examined personality predictors of survival in 283 captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) followed for 18 years. We found that of four gorilla personality dimensions-dominance, extraversion, neuroticism and agreeableness-extraversion was associated with longer survival. This effect could not be explained by demographic information or husbandry practices. These findings suggest that understanding how extraversion and other personality domains influence longevity requires investigating the evolutionary bases of this association in nonhuman primates and other species."
Molecular Evidence for the Presence of Rickettsia Felis in the Feces of Wild-living African Apes,"['Keita, AK', 'Socolovschi, C', 'Ahuka-Mundeke, S', 'Ratmanov, P', 'Butel, C', 'Ayouba, A', 'Inogwabini, BI', 'Muyembe-Tamfum, JJ', 'Mpoudi-Ngole, E', 'Delaporte, E', 'Peeters, M', 'Fenollar, F', 'Raoult, D']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0054679,FEB 6 2013,16,"Background: Rickettsia felis is a common emerging pathogen detected in mosquitoes in sub-Saharan Africa. We hypothesized that, as with malaria, great apes may be exposed to the infectious bite of infected mosquitoes and release R. felis DNA in their feces.

Methods: We conducted a study of 17 forest sites in Central Africa, testing 1,028 fecal samples from 313 chimpanzees, 430 gorillas and 285 bonobos. The presence of rickettsial DNA was investigated by specific quantitative real-time PCR. Positive results were confirmed by a second PCR using primers and a probe targeting a specific gene for R. felis. All positive samples were sequenced.

Results: Overall, 113 samples (11%) were positive for the Rickettsia-specific gltA gene, including 25 (22%) that were positive for R. felis. The citrate synthase (gltA) sequence and outer membrane protein A (ompA) sequence analysis indicated 99% identity at the nucleotide level to R. felis. The 88 other samples (78%) were negative using R. felis-specific qPCR and were compatible with R. felis-like organisms.

Conclusion: For the first time, we detected R. felis in wild-living ape feces. This non invasive detection of human pathogens in endangered species opens up new possibilities in the molecular epidemiology and evolutionary analysis of infectious diseases, beside HIV and malaria."
Phenotypic Plasticity of Climbing-Related Traits in the Ankle Joint of Great Apes and Rainforest Hunter-Gatherers,"['Venkataraman, VV', 'Kraft, TS', 'Desilva, JM', 'Dominy, NJ', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",HUMAN BIOLOGY,NA,FEB-JUN 2013,7,"The ""negrito"" and African ""pygmy"" phenotypes are predominately exhibited by hunter-gatherers living in rainforest habitats. Foraging within such habitats is associated with a unique set of locomotor behaviors, most notably habitual vertical climbing during the pursuit of honey, fruit, and game. When performed frequently, this behavior is expected to correlate with developmentally plastic skeletal morphologies that respond to mechanical loading. Using six measurements in the distal tibia and talus that discriminate nonhuman primates by vertical climbing frequency, we tested the prediction that intraspecific variation in this behavior is reflected in the morphology of the ankle joint of habitually climbing human populations. First, to explore the plasticity of climbing-linked morphologies, we made comparisons between chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans from wild and captive settings. The analysis revealed significant differences in two climbing-linked traits (anterior expansion of the articular surface of the distal tibia and increased degree of talar wedging), indicating that these traits are sensitive to climbing behavior. However, our analyses did not reveal any signatures of climbing behavior in the ankles of habitually climbing hunter-gatherers. These results suggest that the detection of fine-grained differences in human locomotor behaviors at the ankle joint, particularly those associated with arboreality, may be obscured by the functional demands of terrestrial bipedalism. Accordingly, it may be difficult to use population-level characteristics of ankle morphology to make inferences about the climbing behavior of hominins in the fossil record, even when facultative arborealism is associated with key fitness benefits."
Genetic census reveals increased but uneven growth of a critically endangered mountain gorilla population,"['Gray, M', 'Roy, J', 'Vigilant, L', 'Fawcett, K', 'Basabose, A', 'Cranfield, M', 'Uwingeli, P', 'Mburanumwe, I', 'Kagoda, E', 'Robbins, MM']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2012.09.018,FEB 2013,15,"Monitoring changes in the population dynamics of endangered species is crucial to effective conservation strategies. The mountain gorilla population of the Virunga Massif has been the subject of intensive conservation efforts, research and several censuses over the last 40 years, but the region has also been affected by political instability and war. Here we present results from the 2010 census, which was the first to utilize genetic analyses of fecal samples for the entire population. The genetic analyses improved the accuracy of the population estimate by identifying several instances in which gorillas otherwise would have been undercounted or double-counted. The population was estimated to be 480 individuals; including 349 individuals found in 24 groups that were habituated for research and tourism, 101 individuals found in 12 unhabituated groups, fourteen solitary males, and a correction factor of sixteen for undetected infants. The population has increased by 26% since 2003 (an annual rate of 3.7%) and it has almost doubled since 1981. Nearly all of the increase can be attributed to a relatively higher growth rate in the habituated groups from 2003 to 2010, and in all five of the previous intervals between consecutive censuses. Nonetheless, it would be imprudent to habituate additional groups due to the concomitant risks of disease transmission from humans, behavioral disturbance and potential vulnerability to poaching. The results show that it is possible for conservation efforts to succeed even under difficult conditions, while highlighting the continuing challenges of managing a wild population of both habituated and unhabituated gorillas.

In this study, we examined the paw laterality and grasping success rate of 30 Tupaia belangeri (15 males, 15 females) in 2 forced-food grasping tasks (i.e., in a forced-food grasping experiment, the animal has to use paws instead of mouth for food retrieval). We also attempted to determine whether paw usage would be affected by the availability of visual cues using both a visual task (transparent tube) and a nonvisual task (identical but opaque tube). In both tasks, tree shrews showed paw preferences at an individual but not at a population level. Paw laterality (direction and strength) did not differ between tasks. Moreover, in the specific task that we used, grasping success rate was not affected by an absence of visual cues, indicating that tree shrews did not rely on visual guidance to direct their grasps in this forced-food grasping experiment. Our findings suggest that, in contrast to primates, paw usage in tree shrews may result from a modification of a fixed motor pattern in which the preferred direction may be learned. This basic motor organization might be a first step in the evolution of manual laterality, which eventually became controlled by vision in the primate lineage."

In Study 1, chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and 2.5-year-old human children experienced a nice experimenter who tried to give food/toys to the subject and a mean experimenter who interrupted the food/toy giving. In studies 2 and 3, nonhuman great apes and human children could only passively observe a similar interaction, in which a nice experimenter and a mean experimenter interacted with a third party. Orangutans and 2.5-year-old human children preferred to approach the nice experimenter rather than the mean one after having directly experienced their respective behaviors. Orangutans, chimpanzees, and 2.5-year-old human children also took into account experimenter actions toward third parties in forming reputations.

The Effect of Body Orientation on Judgments of Human Visual Attention in Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Bania, AE', 'Stromberg, EE']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0027261,FEB 2013,5,"The ability to appreciate the attentional states of others is an important element used in discerning the presence of Theory of Mind in an individual. Whether primates are able to recognize attention, and further, use such information to predict behavior, remains contentious. In this study, six western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) were tested under different conditions that aimed to investigate not only their understanding of what a human experimenter sees, but also what information they use to make these judgments. In all experiments the gorillas selected between two human experimenters, one who could see them and one who could not. In Experiment 1 the gorillas' performance was significantly above chance in conditions where they judged body orientation, head orientation, and eyes. Experiment 2 showed that the gorillas' initial judgments of attention may be based on body orientation rather than facial cues. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the gorillas were better able to utilize facial cues in some conditions, when these cues were paired with a more neutral body orientation. These findings suggest that the gorillas are using a hierarchical approach to determining visual attention, by making an immediate decision based on the most salient cue-body orientation. However, when body orientation is more ambiguous their ability to judge the less prominent cues of the face and eyes does improve."
"Placental invasion, preeclampsia risk and adaptive molecular evolution at the origin of the great apes: Evidence from genome-wide analyses","['Crosley, EJ', 'Elliot, MG', 'Christians, JK', 'Crespi, BJ']",PLACENTA,10.1016/j.placenta.2012.12.001,FEB 2013,10,"Introduction: Recent evidence from chimpanzees and gorillas has raised doubts that preeclampsia is a uniquely human disease. The deep extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion and spiral artery remodeling that characterizes our placenta (and is abnormal in preeclampsia) is shared within great apes, setting Homininae apart from Hylobatidae and Old World Monkeys, which show much shallower trophoblast invasion and limited spiral artery remodeling. We hypothesize that the evolution of a more invasive placenta in the lineage ancestral to the great apes involved positive selection on genes crucial to EVT invasion and spiral artery remodeling. Furthermore, identification of placentally-expressed genes under selection in this lineage may identify novel genes involved in placental development.

Methods: We tested for positive selection in approximately 18,000 genes using the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous amino acid substitution for protein-coding DNA. DAVID Bioinformatics Resources identified biological processes enriched in positively selected genes, including processes related to EVT invasion and spiral artery remodeling.

Results: Analyses revealed 295 and 264 genes under significant positive selection on the branches ancestral to Hominidae (Human, Chimp, Gorilla, Orangutan) and Homininae (Human, Chimp, Gorilla), respectively. Gene ontology analysis of these gene sets demonstrated significant enrichments for several functional gene clusters relevant to preeclampsia risk, and sets of placentally-expressed genes that have been linked with preeclampsia and/or trophoblast invasion in other studies.

Conclusion: Our study represents a novel approach to the identification of candidate genes and amino acid residues involved in placental pathologies by implicating them in the evolution of highly-invasive placenta. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Dietary correlates of temporomandibular joint morphology in the great apes,"['Terhune, CE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22204,FEB 2013,5,"Behavioral observations of great apes have consistently identified differences in feeding behavior among species, and these differences have been linked to variation in masticatory form. As the point at which the mandible and cranium articulate, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is an important component of the masticatory apparatus. Forces are transmitted between the mandible and cranium via the TMJ, and this joint helps govern mandibular range of motion. This study examined the extent to which TMJ form covaries with feeding behavior in the great apes by testing a series of biomechanical hypotheses relating to specific components of joint shape using linear measurements extracted from three-dimensional coordinate data. Results of these analyses found that taxa differ significantly in TMJ shape, particularly in the mandibular fossa. Chimpanzees have relatively more anteroposteriorly elongated joint surfaces, whereas gorillas tend to have relatively anteroposteriorly compressed joints. Orangutans were most commonly intermediate in form between Pan and Gorilla, perhaps reflecting a trade-off between jaw gape and load resistance capabilities. Importantly, much of the observed variation among taxa reflects differences in morphologies that facilitate gape over force production. These data therefore continue to emphasize the unclear relationship between mandibular loading and bony morphology, but highlight the need for further data regarding food material properties, jaw gape, and ingestive/food processing behaviors.

Their diet resembles that expected more of smaller bodied primates. Patas monkeys are also more like smaller bodied primates in reproducing at high rates. We sought to better understand the convergence of patas monkeys with smaller bodied primates by comparing their feeding behavior on ants and gum with that of closely related, sympatric vervets (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), and analyzing the nutrient content of the gum of A. drepanolobium and of Crematogaster mimosae, the most common ant species eaten by patas monkeys in Laikipia, Kenya. All occurrences of feeding and moving during focal animal sampling revealed that 1) patas monkeys seek A. drepanolobium gum but vervets avoid it; 2) both species open swollen thorns most often in the morning when antsare less active; 3) patas monkeys continually feed onswollen thorns and gum while moving quickly throughout the day, whereas vervets reduce their consumption of these items and their travel rate at mid-day, and; 4) vervets eat young swollen thorns at a higher rate than patas monkeys. Patas monkeys are able to spend little time acquiring substantial amounts of energy, protein, and minerals from A. drepanolobium gum and C. mimosae ants each day.

Carrion fly-derived DNA as a tool for comprehensive and cost-effective assessment of mammalian biodiversity,"['Calvignac-Spencer, S', 'Merkel, K', 'Kutzner, N', 'Kuhl, H', 'Boesch, C', 'Kappeler, PM', 'Metzger, S', 'Schubert, G', 'Leendertz, FH']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1111/mec.12183,FEB 2013,20,"Large-scale monitoring schemes are essential in assessing global mammalian biodiversity, and in this framework, leeches have recently been promoted as an indirect source of DNA from terrestrial mammal species. Carrion feeding flies are ubiquitous and can be expected to feed on many vertebrate carcasses. Hence, we tested whether fly-derived DNA analysis may also serve as a novel tool for mammalian diversity surveys. We screened DNA extracted from 201 carrion flies collected in tropical habitats of Cote d'Ivoire and Madagascar for mammal DNA using multiple PCR systems and retrieved DNA sequences from a diverse set of species (22 in Cote d'Ivoire, four in Madagascar) exploiting distinct forest strata and displaying a broad range of body sizes. Deep sequencing of amplicons generated from pools of flies performed equally well as individual sequencing approaches. We conclude that the analysis of fly-derived DNA can be implemented in a very rapid and cost-effective manner and will give a relatively unbiased picture of local mammal diversity. Carrion flies therefore represent an extraordinary and thus far unexploited resource of mammal DNA, which will probably prove useful for future inventories of wild mammal communities."
Human handedness: An inherited evolutionary trait,"['Forrester, GS', 'Quaresmini, C', 'Leavens, DA', 'Mareschal, D', 'Thomas, MSC']",BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH,10.1016/j.bbr.2012.09.037,JAN 15 2013,22,"Our objective was to demonstrate that human population-level, right-handedness, is not species specific, precipitated from language areas in the brain, but rather is context specific and inherited from a behavior common to both humans and great apes. In general, previous methods of assessing human handedness have neglected to consider the context of action, or employ methods suitable for direct comparison across species. We employed a bottom-up, context-sensitive method to quantitatively assess manual actions in right-handed, typically developing children during naturalistic behavior. By classifying the target to which participants directed a manual action, as animate (social partner, self) or inanimate (non-living functional objects), we found that children demonstrated a significant right-hand bias for manual actions directed toward inanimate targets, but not for manual actions directed toward animate targets. This pattern was revealed at both the group and individual levels. We used a focal video sampling, corpus data-mining approach to allow for direct comparisons with captive gorillas (Forrester et al. Animal Cognition 2011;14(6):903-7) and chimpanzees (Forrester et al. Animal Cognition, in press). Comparisons of handedness patters support the view that population-level, human handedness, and its origin in cerebral lateralization is not a new or human-unique characteristic. These data are consistent with the theory that human right-handedness is a trait developed through tool use that was inherited from an ancestor common to both humans and great apes.

"Structural, phylogenetic and docking studies of D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA), a candidate schizophrenia gene","['Sehgal, SA', 'Khattak, NA', 'Mir, A']",THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICAL MODELLING,10.1186/1742-4682-10-3,JAN 4 2013,3,"Background: Schizophrenia is a neurodegenerative disorder that occurs worldwide and can be difficult to diagnose. It is the foremost neurological disorder leading to suicide among patients in both developed and underdeveloped countries. D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA), also known as G72, is directly implicated in the glutamateric hypothesis of schizophrenia. It activates D-amino acid oxidase, which oxidizes D-serine, leading to modulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.

Methods: MODELLER (9v10) was utilized to generate three dimensional structures of the DAOA candidate gene. The HOPE server was used for mutational analysis. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA5) tool was utilized to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the candidate gene DAOA. AutoDock was used for protein-ligand docking and Gramm-X and PatchDock for protein-protein docking.

Results: A suitable template (1ZCA) was selected by employing BLASTp on the basis of 33% query coverage, 27% identity and E-value 4.9. The Rampage evaluation tool showed 91.1% favored region, 4.9% allowed region and 4.1% outlier region in DAOA. ERRAT demonstrated that the predicted model had a 50.909% quality factor. Mutational analysis of DAOA revealed significant effects on hydrogen bonding and correct folding of the DAOA protein, which in turn affect protein conformation. Ciona was inferred as the outgroup. Tetrapods were in their appropriate clusters with bifurcations. Human amino acid sequences are conserved, with chimpanzee and gorilla showing more than 80% homology and bootstrap value based on 1000 replications. Molecular docking analysis was employed to elucidate the binding mode of the reported ligand complex for DAOA. The docking experiment demonstrated that DAOA is involved in major amino acid interactions: the residues that interact most strongly with the ligand C28H28N3O5PS2 are polar but uncharged (Gln36, Asn38, Thr 122) and non-polar hydrophobic (Ile119, Ser171, Ser21, Ala31). Protein-protein docking simulation demonstrated two ionic bonds and one hydrogen bond involving DAOA. Lys-7 of the receptor protein interacted with Lys-163 and Asp-2037. Tyr-03 interacted with Arg-286 of the ligand protein and formed a hydrogen bond.

Conclusion: The predicted interactions might serve to inhibit the disease-related allele. It is assumed that current bioinformatics methods will contribute significantly to identifying, analyzing and curing schizophrenia. There is an urgent need to develop effective drugs for schizophrenia, and tools for examining candidate genes more accurately and efficiently are required."
Are surgeons spunkier than non-surgeons?,"['Pai, SA', 'Shivashanker, S']",NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA,NA,JAN-FEB 2013,3,"Background. Surgeons are known to be bolder than other members of the medical profession. Testosterone levels are known to be higher in aggressive men. We wondered whether the above two statements indicated that the spunkiness of surgeons was related to higher testosterone levels.

Methods. Sixteen surgeons and 16 non-surgeons, all men, aged 32-59 years took part in a prospective study that assessed their testosterone levels.

Results. There was no statistical difference between the testosterone levels of the two groups.

Conclusion. The reason for the gutsy behaviour of surgeons Is not linked to their testosterone levels. Surgeons were disappointed to know this while non-surgeons were amused and a bit relieved."
More than Monkeys and Machines,"['Partido, JPN']",PENSAMIENTO,NA,2013,0,"The question of what we really are has been open for centuries, allowing us to speculate and even dreaming with the answer that better respond to the idea of ourselves.

And suddenly, in just a moment historically speaking, science has shown us that we are nothing more than primates, more evolved than chimps and gorillas with whom we share 99% of our genetic code. It seems that we have a choice of mutually exclusive options, or our nature is reduced to a mere sophisticated biological mechanism or science is unable to reveal the essence of who we are, at least, without question some of their assumptions more basic. We face the most complex and difficult question that we ask in the context of the knowledge in science."
Dynamic actin gene family evolution in primates.,"['Zhu, Liucun', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Hu, Yijun', 'Wen, Tieqiao', 'Wang, Qiang']",BioMed research international,10.1155/2013/630803,2013 (Epub 2013 Jun 06),0,"Actin is one of the most highly conserved proteins and plays crucial roles in many vital cellular functions. In most eukaryotes, it is encoded by a multigene family. Although the actin gene family has been studied a lot, few investigators focus on the comparison of actin gene family in relative species. Here, the purpose of our study is to systematically investigate characteristics and evolutionary pattern of actin gene family in primates. We identified 233 actin genes in human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, rhesus monkey, and marmoset genomes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that actin genes in the seven species could be divided into two major types of clades: orthologous group versus complex group. Codon usages and gene expression patterns of actin gene copies were highly consistent among the groups because of basic functions needed by the organisms, but much diverged within species due to functional diversification. Besides, many great potential pseudogenes were found with incomplete open reading frames due to frameshifts or early stop codons. These results implied that actin gene family in primates went through ""birth and death"" model of evolution process. Under this model, actin genes experienced strong negative selection and increased the functional complexity by reproducing themselves."
zipHMMlib: a highly optimised HMM library exploiting repetitions in the input to speed up the forward algorithm,"['Sand, A', 'Kristiansen, M', 'Pedersen, CNS', 'Mailund, T']",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,10.1186/1471-2105-14-339,NOV 22 2013,1,"Background: Hidden Markov models are widely used for genome analysis as they combine ease of modelling with efficient analysis algorithms. Calculating the likelihood of a model using the forward algorithm has worst case time complexity linear in the length of the sequence and quadratic in the number of states in the model. For genome analysis, however, the length runs to millions or billions of observations, and when maximising the likelihood hundreds of evaluations are often needed. A time efficient forward algorithm is therefore a key ingredient in an efficient hidden Markov model library.

Results: We have built a software library for efficiently computing the likelihood of a hidden Markov model. The library exploits commonly occurring substrings in the input to reuse computations in the forward algorithm. In a pre-processing step our library identifies common substrings and builds a structure over the computations in the forward algorithm which can be reused. This analysis can be saved between uses of the library and is independent of concrete hidden Markov models so one preprocessing can be used to run a number of different models. Using this library, we achieve up to 78 times shorter wall-clock time for realistic whole-genome analyses with a real and reasonably complex hidden Markov model. In one particular case the analysis was performed in less than 8 minutes compared to 9.6 hours for the previously fastest library.

Conclusions: We have implemented the preprocessing procedure and forward algorithm as a C++ library, zipHMM, with Python bindings for use in scripts. The library is available at http://birc.au.dk/software/ziphmm/."

The specific strategies of three groups of pathogens for crossing the species barrier among primates will be discussed. In Africa, gorillas and chimpanzees have succumbed for years to simultaneous epizootics (i.e.. ""multi-emergence'') of Ebola virus in places where they are in contact with Chiropters, which could be animal reservoirs of these viruses. Human epidemics often follow these major outbreaks. Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) have an ancient history of coevolution and many interspecific exchanges with their natural hosts. Chimpanzee and gorilla SIVs have crossed the species barrier at different times and places, leading to the emergence of HIV-1 and HIV-2. Other retroviruses, such as the Simian T-Lymphotropic Viruses and Foamiviruses, have also a unique ancient or recent history of crossing the species barrier. The identification of gorilla Plasmodium parasites that are genetically close to P. falciparum suggests that gorillas were the source of the deadly human P. falciparum. Nonhuman plasmodium species that can infect humans represent an underestimated risk."

We monitored over a 3-year period clinical signs within a group of wild western gorillas (G. gorilla) undergoing habituation at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic. The majority of observations consisted of singular coughs and sneezes among the gorillas. These were the only clinical signs that significantly and positively increased over the years. No changes in the demography of the study group were observed. While clinical signs are not necessarily indicative of 'disease' or other health-related problems, we discuss how long-term records of clinical signs provide useful information when health monitoring, and the importance of the rigid application of preventive disease transmission protocols.

Bilateral Asymmetry of Humeral Torsion and Length in African Apes and Humans,"['Barros, A', 'Soligo, C']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000353177,2013,1,"Few studies have directly compared human and African ape upper limb skeletal asymmetries despite the potential such comparisons have for understanding the origins of functional lateralization in humans and non-human primates. Here, we report the magnitude and direction of asymmetries in humeral torsion and humeral length in paired humeri of 40 Gorilla gorilla, 40 Pan troglodytes and 40 Homo sapiens. We test whether absolute and directional asymmetries differ between measurements, species and sexes. Our results show that humans are unique in being lateralized to the right for both measurements, consistent with human population-level handedness patterns, while apes show no significant directionality at the species level in either measurement. However, absolute torsion asymmetries in apes occur in the same magnitude as in humans, suggesting the existence of functional lateralization at the individual level. (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel"

Since then, significant strides have been made in developing genomics capabilities for NHP research, from the rhesus macaque genome sequencing project to the construction of the first macaque-specific high-density oligonucleotide microarray, paving the way for further resource development and additional primate sequencing projects. Complete published draft genome sequences are now available for the chimpanzee ( Chimpanzee Sequencing Analysis Consortium 2005), bonobo ( Prufer et al. 2012), gorilla ( Scally et al. 2012), and baboon ( Ensembl.org 2013), along with the recently completed draft genomes for the cynomolgus macaque and Chinese rhesus macaque.

Results showed that all four non-human great ape species managed to quantify split objects but that their performance varied as a function of the non-cohesiveness produced in the splitting event. Spatial ambiguity and shape invariance had the greatest impact on apes' ability to represent and quantify objects. Further, we observed species differences with gorillas performing lower than other species.

Gorillas' use of the escape response in object choice memory tests,"['Suda-King, C', 'Bania, AE', 'Stromberg, EE', 'Subiaul, F']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-012-0551-5,JAN 2013,5,"The ability to monitor and control one's own cognitive states, metacognition, is crucial for effective learning and problem solving. Although the literature on animal metacognition has grown considerably during last 15 years, there have been few studies examining whether great apes share such introspective abilities with humans. Here, we tested whether four gorillas could meet two criteria of animal metacognition, the increase in escape responses as a function of task difficulty and the chosen-forced performance advantage. During testing, the subjects participated in a series of object choice memory tests in which a preferable reward (two grapes) was placed under one of two or three blue cups. The apes were required to correctly select the baited blue cup in this primary test. Importantly, the subjects also had an escape response (a yellow cup), where they could obtain a secure but smaller reward (one grape) without taking the memory test. Although the gorillas received a relatively small number of trials and thus experienced little training, three gorillas significantly declined the memory tests more often in difficult trials (e.g., when the location of the preferred reward conflicted with side bias) than in easy trials (e.g., when there was no such conflict). Moreover, even when objective cues were eliminated that corresponded to task difficulty, one of the successful gorillas showed evidence suggestive of improved memory performance with the help of escape response by selectively avoiding trials in which he would be likely to err before the memory test actually proceeded. Together, these findings demonstrate that at least some gorillas may be able to make optimal choices on the basis of their own memory trace strength about the location of the preferred reward."

The variation of the MHC also makes it of evolutionary interest and therefore we analyse the sequence in the context of human and chimpanzee. In our comparisons with human and re-annotated chimpanzee MHC sequence we find that gorilla has a trimodular RCCX cluster, versus the reference human bimodular cluster, and additional copies of Class I (pseudo)genes between Gogo-K and Gogo-A (the orthologues of HLA-K and -A). We also find that Gogo-H (and Patr-H) is coding versus the HLA-H pseudogene and, conversely, there is a Gogo-DQB2 pseudogene versus the HLA-DQB2 coding gene. Our analysis, which is freely available through the VEGA genome browser, provides the research community with a comprehensive dataset for comparative and evolutionary research of the MHC."

The subspecies is endemic to approximately 12-14 sites at the Cameroon-Nigeria border, and is critically endangered. To understand survival prospects of the CRG at Mawambi Hills, Cameroon, a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) distribution model was used to predict the distribution of gorillas. Overall, 24% of the study area was predicted to be suitable for gorillas. The most important predictors of gorilla distribution were elevation as a surrogate for accessibility (52.4%), distance to nearby villages which represents proximity to anthropogenic disturbance (22.7%), and slope steepness as a proxy for security (19.4%). Gorillas mainly occupied slopes of steep hills and avoided areas of human disturbance. To evaluate the spatial relationship between gorilla distribution and human activities, the predicted habitat suitability map was overlaid with a kernel density map of human activities. A positive correlation was found between locations of human activity and suitable habitat for gorillas (r = 0.5). This suggests that anthropogenic pressures in previously unused forest areas are increasing as a result of resource depletion at lower altitudes, consequently putting the gorillas at greater risk. Conservation management plans that seek to reduce human encroachment into habitats preferred by gorillas such as steep hills will probably contribute to gorilla survival. Copyright (c) 2013 S.

Gorilla by Anthony Browne through dual narrators' eyes",['김정선'],Journal of Children＇s Literature and Education,NA,2013,0,"Gorilla written and illustrated by Anthony Browne is one of the most mentioned picturebooks in the world. So it is not surprising at all that Gorilla has been studied more than any other picturebook texts. However, the reason that this study also focused on Gorilla is not to follow previous studies but to present a different point of view. The dual narrator in the picturebook makes Gorilla more unique having various significations. The picturebook has a dual narration system in which one narrator represents word-text and the other represents image-text. They show their own point of view, sometimes fight, and especially in Gorilla, represent their own main character. The word-text narrator focuses Hannah as the main character, while the image-text narrator focuses on Hannah's father. Two main characters and implied readers are formed. Especially the image-text narrator has differ ways to focus the main character with pattern, color, background, etc. Furthermore, dual narrators focalize each other and make real readers doubt about modality. Therefore, this study can discusses the identity of Gorilla, which has never been told before, and readers also have more chances to explore Gorilla through a variety of non-leaner ways."
Managing tourism growth in endangered species' habitats of Africa: Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda,"['Munanura, IE', 'Backman, KF', 'Sabuhoro, E']",CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM,10.1080/13683500.2013.785483,2013,0,"Like other developing African countries, Rwanda has embraced nature-based tourism for its economic potential. However, tourism can cause irreversible harm, especially in fragile but popular tourist destinations such as Volcanoes National Park (VPN) in Rwanda, which is home to endangered species. Instead of focusing greater attention on this risk, park management has embarked on expanding tourism for greater revenue opportunities. Thus, this paper aims to explore tourism growth and potential resulting threats, investigate the capacity of tourism staff to manage the projected growth, and provide recommendations for management to develop tourism while considering its long-term effects. In addition to conducting interviews with senior park management, Appreciative Inquiry was utilised, which involves stages of grounding, discovery, and design to promote stakeholders' discussions on the future of tourism for VPN and GIS ArcView to map tourism use zones. The results highlight three main findings. First, tourism revenue-driven enthusiasm overshadows the park's fragility. Second, the proposed growth does not include an appropriate impact mitigation strategy. Third, human resources' skills for managing the planned tourism growth are limited. Consequently, the planned tourism growth could potentially destroy the park. Several recommendations (e. g. tourism use zoning plan) are made."
Visual metonymy in children's picture books,"['Guijarro, AJM']",REVIEW OF COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS,10.1075/rcl.11.2.08moy,2013,0,"This article aims to explore how the use of visual metonymies in picture books contributes to children's understanding of stories and, in turn, attracts their attention towards relevant aspects of the plot. The two picture books selected for analysis are Gorilla, by Browne, and The Tale of Peter Rabbit, by Potter, intended for children under 9 years of age.

A multimodal and cognitive perspective is adopted here to apply the nonverbal trope of visual metonymy to the two picture books that form the sample texts (Forceville, 2009, 2010; Forceville & Urios-Aparisi, 2009).

The results of the analysis show that visual metonymies are essentially used in children's tales to create narrative tension in certain stages of the plot and, in turn, to establish a bond between the represented participants and the child-viewer."

However, in lowland Afrotropical forests, the specific role of the largest primate species, the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla Savage and Wyman, 1847), has been overlooked. This is of particular relevance as this species seems to fulfill important criteria for effective dispersal, both quantitatively and qualitatively. One trait makes it potentially unique as seed disperser; the regular deposition of seeds in open canopy environments where light will not be a limiting factor for subsequent seedling growth and survival. The magnitude of which this particular trait contributes to forest dynamics remains unexplored though it could be potentially important. It might no longer be the case, however, as the western lowland gorilla is critically endangered. The loss of the ecological services provided by large-bodied seed dispersers may have considerable impacts on the forests. Through dispersal limitation, population dynamics of plants in forests devoid of large frugivores will be strongly impacted. In the long-term, this may lead to shifts in plant community structure, composition and to reduced tree diversity. Currently, forests of the Congo basin face increasing level of deforestation and degradation, which puts already the ecosystem integrity in jeopardy. The additional threat that represents frugivorous wildlife depletion is therefore of forest management concern."
Quantification of the Dental Morphology of Orangutans,"['Nambiar, P', 'John, J', 'Al-Amery, SM', 'Purmal, K', 'Chai, WL', 'Ngeow, WC', 'Mohamed, NH', 'Vellayan, S']",SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL,10.1155/2013/213757,2013,0,"Orangutans are believed to have close biological affinities to humans. Teeth being the hardest tissue provide useful information on primate evolution. Furthermore, knowledge of the pulp chamber and root canal morphology is important for dental treatment. A female Bornean orangutan and a Sumatran male orangutan skull were available for this study. Both of their dentitions, comprising 50 teeth, were scanned employing the cone-beam computed tomography for both metrical and nonmetrical analyses. Measurements included tooth and crown length, root length, enamel covered crown height, root canal length (posterior teeth), length of pulpal space (anterior teeth), and root canal width. Nonmetrical parameters included number of canals per root, number of foramina in each root, and root canal morphology according to Vertucci's classification. It was found that the enamel covered crown height was the longest in the upper central incisors although the canine was the longest amongst the anterior teeth. Both the upper premolars were three-rooted while the lower second premolar of the Sumatran orangutan was two-rooted, with two foramina. The mandibular lateral incisors of the Bornean orangutan were longer than the central incisors, a feature similar to humans. In addition, secondary dentine deposition was noticed, a feature consistent with aged humans."
Teeth and Human Life-History Evolution,"['Smith, TM']","ANNUAL REVIEW OF ANTHROPOLOGY, VOL 42",10.1146/annurev-anthro-092412-155550,2013,8,"Modern humans differ from wild great apes in gestation length, weaning age, interbirth interval, sexual maturity, and longevity, but evolutionary anthropologists do not know when these distinctive life-history conditions evolved. Dental tissues contain faithful records of birth and incremental growth, and scholars suggest that molar eruption age, tooth wear, growth disturbances, tooth chemistry, and/or tooth calcification may provide insight into the evolution of human life history. However, recent comparative approaches and empirical evidence demonstrate that caution is warranted when inferring hominin weaning ages or interbirth intervals from first molar eruption, tooth wear, or growth disturbances. Fine-scaled studies of tooth chemistry provide direct evidence of weaning. Early hominin tooth calcification is more ape-like than human-like, and fully modern patterns appear only after Neanderthals and Homo sapiens diverged, concurrent with changes in cranial and postcranial development. Additional studies are needed to relate these novel calcification patterns to specific changes in life-history variables."
Ground Night Nesting in Chimpanzees: New Insights from Central Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in South-East Cameroon,"['Tagg, N', 'Willie, J', 'Petre, CA', 'Haggis, O']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000353172,2013,3,"Some chimpanzee populations exhibit ground night nesting, which occurs in different habitat types, is driven by a variety of interconnected factors, and may reflect cultural or social differences. This has important implications for ape conservation management, given that accurate nest builder identification is required to estimate density, crucial in monitoring, and allows inferences about environmental and social factors that may have contributed to the transition from tree to ground sleeping in early hominins. We conducted a 24-month marked nest count survey in La Belgique, Cameroon, and recorded the occurrence of chimpanzee tree and ground night nests, temperature and rainfall, predator and large mammal abundance, human activities, nesting tree species, and Uapaca spp. consumption. Ground night nesting occurred at a rate of 3.47% (n = 1,008), with more in swamps, in the dry season and with increasing human activities. We found no influence of leopard/elephant presence, but a possible influence of lack of nesting trees. We suggest chimpanzees visit swamps in the dry season (low water levels) for relief from hunting pressure and to consume Uapaca spp. fruits. Ground nesting may be enabled due to high abundance of terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, and may be favoured for inconspicuousness and safety from gun hunters. (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel"
Laterality in the gestural communication of wild chimpanzees,"['Hobaiter, C', 'Byrne, RW']",EVOLUTION OF HUMAN HANDEDNESS,10.1111/nyas.12041,2013,3,"We examined hand preference in the intentional gestural communication of wild chimpanzees in the Budongo forest, Uganda. Individuals showed some tendency to be lateralized, although less than has been reported for begging and pointing gestures in captivity; on average, their absolute bias was around 0.25 (where 1.0 represents complete right-or left-hand use and 0.0 represents no bias). Lateralization was incomplete even in individuals with major manual disabilities. Where individuals had a stronger preference, this was more often toward the right hand; moreover, as age increased, the direction (but not the extent) of hand preference shifted toward the right. While the gestural repertoire as a whole was largely employed ambilateraly, object-manipulation gestures showed a strong right-hand bias."
"Kin, Daytime Associations, or Preferred Sleeping Sites? Factors Influencing Sleep Site Selection in Captive Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)","['Lock, LC', 'Anderson, JR']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000351553,2013,0,"Chimpanzee nesting behaviours and the factors that may influence these behaviours are rarely studied in captive settings. In the present study, the daytime associations, sleeping site selections and nesting groups of 11 zoo-housed chimpanzees over a 29-day period were analysed. Neither daytime associations nor presence of kin influenced sleeping site selection in females. Daytime associations did influence sleeping arrangements in males. Nighttime spatial arrangements and individual preferences for specific sleeping areas were broadly comparable to nesting patterns reported in free-living chimpanzee communities. In the interests of captive ape welfare, we conclude that exhibits should incorporate multilevel nesting areas and a choice of several potential sleeping sites. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

Documenting orang-utan sleep architecture: sleeping platform complexity increases sleep quality in captive Pongo,"['Samson, DR', 'Shumaker, RW']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/1568539X-00003082,2013,4,"Of the extant primates, only 20 non-human species have been studied by sleep scientists. Notable sampling gaps exist, including large-bodied hominoids such as gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), orangutans (Pongo spp.) and bonobos (Pan paniscus), for which data have been characterized as high priority. Here, we report the sleep architecture of three female and two male orang-utans housed at the Indianapolis Zoo. Sleep states were identified by scoring correlated behavioural signatures (e.g., respiration, gross body movement, muscle atonia, random eye movement, etc.). The captive orang-utans were focal subjects for a total of 70 nights (1013 h) recorded. We found that orangutans slept an average of 9.11 h (range 5.85-11.2 h) nightly and were characterized by an average NREM of 8.03 h (range 5.47-10.2 h) and REM of 1.11 (range: 0.38-2.2 h) per night. In addition, using a sleeping platform complexity index (SPCI) we found that individuals that manufactured and slept in more complex beds were characterized by higher quality sleep. Sleep fragmentation (the number of brief awakenings greater than 2 mm per hour), arousability (number of motor activity bouts per hour), and total time awake per night were reduced by greater quality sleep environments. Therefore, comfortable sleeping environments reduced arousability and improve sleep quality in captive orang-utans. These results support Fruth & Hohmann's (1996) hypothesis, which purported that the tree-limb-to-sleeping platform transition in Miocene apes improved sleep quality."

That term would also include which part of the particular bone was affected. That, in addition to characteristics of erosions, facilitates distinguishing spondyloarthropathy from rheumatoid arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease and gout. Spondyloarthropathy, however, is not limited to humans. Initially recognized in 20% of gorillas and rhesus macaques, it was subsequently identified in 25% of bears and 35% of rhinoceros. It is truly a pan-mammalian phenomenon, extending from marsupials and rodents to whales and as ancient as dinosaurs."
Dynamic Actin Gene Family Evolution in Primates,"['Zhu, LC', 'Zhang, Y', 'Hu, YJ', 'Wen, TQ', 'Wang, Q']",BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,10.1155/2013/630803,2013,2,"Actin is one of the most highly conserved proteins and plays crucial roles in many vital cellular functions. In most eukaryotes, it is encoded by a multigene family. Although the actin gene family has been studied a lot, few investigators focus on the comparison of actin gene family in relative species. Here, the purpose of our study is to systematically investigate characteristics and evolutionary pattern of actin gene family in primates. We identified 233 actin genes in human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, rhesus monkey, and marmoset genomes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that actin genes in the seven species could be divided into two major types of clades: orthologous group versus complex group. Codon usages and gene expression patterns of actin gene copies were highly consistent among the groups because of basic functions needed by the organisms, but much diverged within species due to functional diversification. Besides, many great potential pseudogenes were found with incomplete open reading frames due to frameshifts or early stop codons. These results implied that actin gene family in primates went through ""birth and death"" model of evolution process. Under this model, actin genes experienced strong negative selection and increased the functional complexity by reproducing themselves."

Impacts of logging and hunting on western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) populations and consequences for forest regeneration. A review,"['Haurez, B', 'Petre, CA', 'Doucet, JL']",BIOTECHNOLOGIE AGRONOMIE SOCIETE ET ENVIRONNEMENT,NA,2013,4,"Timber exploitation is rapidly expanding throughout the Congo Basin. Forest areas assigned to timber harvesting have sharply expanded over the decades and logging concessions now largely overlap with the range of western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla Savage & Wyman, 1847). However this species, which is considered as critically endangered by IUCN, could play an essential role in maintaining the structure and composition of tropical rainforest notably through seed dispersal services. This is likely due to its frugivorous diet, high stomach capacity and ability to swallow seeds of variable sizes. Moreover gorillas have a long gut retention time of ingested food, travel long daily distances and deposit most ingested seeds in suitable habitats for plant development (such as logging gaps). Consequently, the preservation of the role of gorilla in forest regeneration is essential in the context of logged forest ecosystems. Timber harvesting has two major opposing impacts on gorilla populations: on the one hand, gorillas benefit from growth of herbaceous vegetation (e.g. Marantaceae and Zingiberaceae) following forest canopy opening, as such herbs provide both staple food and nest-building materials; on the other hand, gorilla populations suffer with the rise in hunting associated with logging activity, especially with road network installation. Considering the potential negative knock-on effects of logging concessions on the ecological function of western lowland gorilla, the implementation of timber harvesting methods that preserve gorilla populations is a considerable challenge for forest sustainability, as well as for gorilla's conservation."
The hand-on gesture in gorillas (Gorilla gorilla),"['Luef, EM', 'Liebal, K']",INTERACTION STUDIES,10.1075/is.14.1.04lue,2013,0,"The gestural repertoire of captive gorillas contains the so-called ""hand-on"" (or ""pat-off"") gesture in which one animals puts its flat hand on top of another's head, which often leads to cessation of the receiver's previous activity. We investigate the origins of this gesture and developmental aspects of gesture creation. We further analyze gesture form and use in relation to the age of the sender with special consideration of the reaction of the receiver to better explain the function of the hand-on. The focus of the study is to compare this gesture across different age groups in gorillas in regard to both production and reception and to get insights into possible origins of the gesture."

Contest competition is assumed to result in despotic, nepotistic, and stable hierarchies. However, female Hanuman langurs are exceptions to this pattern, with data from provisioned populations indicating despotic, yet individualistic (age-inversed) and unstable hierarchies despite strong within-group contest. We present data on hierarchical linearity, stability, and the determinants of female rank and rank change in a population of unprovisioned, wild Hanuman langurs (Ramnagar, Nepal). Based on 12 490 dyadic displacement interactions collected over 5 years from a medium-sized group (P group, mean = 6.9 adult females) and a large group (0 group, mean = 13.6 adult females); stable periods (P group, N = 14; 0 group, N = 31) were identified and dominance hierarchies constructed with the program MatMan. In both groups, dominance hierarchies were linear (p < 0.05), with high directional consistency within dyads. Rank was negatively related with age, while the presence of maternal kin had no effect. Reproductive state affected dominance rank in the larger group, with females ascending the hierarchy prior to conception, and dropping in rank after birth. Ranks were unstable, with group size and the number of juvenile females driving the effect (GLMM, p < 0.001). These results match earlier findings for provisioned populations. In female Hanuman langurs, competition seems most intense around conception and during gestation, creating rank instability, which is further exacerbated by the number of adult as well as maturing females."

In this study, terrestrial and arboreal nest construction among chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) populations was investigated in the Lebialem-Mone Forest Landscape (LMFL), Southwest Region, Cameroon, to examine the anthropogenic effects on nest location. Data on the height, distribution and approximate age of chimpanzee night nests were collected during two 4-week primate field surveys (July to August 2010; July 2011) at two field sites (Bechati and Andu) within the LMFL. Data were collected using the line transect method. Chimpanzee night nests were categorized by their location: arboreal versus terrestrial. During the two field surveys, arboreal night nests were the most frequently constructed nest type at both sites, and the only type of night nest constructed at Bechati. Terrestrial night nests were also constructed at Andu. The main difference between these two sites is the level of human predation and agricultural development. At Bechati chimpanzees inhabit forest regions around dense, expanding villages and are regularly hunted by humans. However, at Andu the chimpanzee populations are not under the same threat. Therefore, terrestrial night nest construction in the LMFL appears to be a behavior exhibited where there is less human presence. Copyright (c) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel"

This was an initial step in the effort to establish a long-term wildlife health-monitoring system in Uganda. This wildlife health-monitoring system is to act as an early warning system for disease outbreaks. The clinic primarily analyzes gorilla fecal samples for parasites and, since its establishment in 2005, has grown to include in its remit livestock, park staff, and symptomatic humans from the Bwindi community. The diagnostic testing capability of the field clinic has expanded to include Giardia spp and Cryptosporidium spp. One policy outcome of this project has been the adoption of regular gorilla fecal sample collection as a health-monitoring intervention in the Uganda Wildlife Authority's annual operational plan. Conservation Through Public Health is also planning to erect a ""One Health"" Gorilla Center, to accommodate extra tests, including polymerase chain reaction, for more accurate detection of cross-species transmission of bacteria, parasites, and other pathogens. The main challenges for the clinic personnel are associated with the building's remote location at the national park. Consequently, the diagnostic facility is not connected to the national electricity grid, which necessitates the use of a more expensive option for power, solar with the aid of a backup generator.

Individualistic female dominance hierarchies with varying strength in a highly folivorous population of black-and-white colobus,"['Wikberg, EC', 'Teichroeb, JA', 'Badescu, I', 'Sicotte, P']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/1568539X-00003050,2013,5,"Females that do not experience strong contest competition for food are presumed to form 'egalitarian' relationships (i.e., lacking strong, linear dominance hierarchies). However, recent studies of Gorilla beringei beringei (mountain gorilla) have documented relatively strong, linear female dominance hierarchies despite them having a highly folivorous diet that generates relatively low levels of within-group contest competition (Robbins et al., 2005, 2007). To investigate if this pattern holds true for other highly folivorous species that may experience low levels of contest competition, we examined the linearity and strength of female dominance hierarchies in a population of Colobus vellerosus (ursine colobus or white-thighed colobus) at Boabeng-Fiema, Ghana. From 2004 to 2011, we collected data via ad libitum and focal sampling of 75 adult and subadult females in eight groups. Half of the study groups had few unknown submissive relationships, and females formed individualistic hierarchies with high linearity indices ranging from 0.9 to 1. There was between-group variation in all components of hierarchical strength (i.e., hierarchical expression, consistency, and stability). Groups showed varying rates of submission, and there was a short latency to detect a linear hierarchy in some groups and a long latency in other groups (i.e., varying levels of hierarchical expression). Females in most groups formed unidirectional and stable relationships. Maturing females challenged older females in some groups, and these groups had more non-linear relationships (i.e., dyads with more submissive interactions down rather than up the hierarchy) and higher rates of individual rank change than other groups. Based on low rates of submission, long latencies, and/or some inconsistencies, we conclude that most groups form relatively weak dominance hierarchies, similar to other egalitarian primates. However, a few groups formed strong dominance hierarchies, similar to some despotic primates. Colobus vellerosus occasionally forage on contestable food items, and this may provide enough incentive for females to establish individualistic dominance hierarchies of varying strength."

The present study reports the presence of Cryptosporidium sp. in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) from Ugalla, western Tanzania. Ugalla is one of the driest, most open, and seasonal habitats inhabited by chimpanzees. Cryptosporidium sp. was found in 8.9% of the samples. The presence of the parasite was determined by preserving fecal samples in chemical conventional fixatives (MIF and alcohol absolute) staining them using a modified Zielh-Neelsen technique, and examining them with a light microscope. The number of fecal samples positive for Cryptosporidium was significantly higher during the rainy than during the dry season (p<0.005). The results showed that feces collected in the rainy season were almost three times more likely to be positive for Cryptosporidium than those collected in the dry season (OR=2.81). Cryptosporidium detection was significantly negatively affected by highest temperatures (>28.7 degrees C, p<0.001). Cryptosporidiosis can cause serious health problems in humans and its potential effect on Ugalla chimpanzees is discussed."

As wild populations continue to decline, the genetic management of the North American captive western lowland gorilla population will be an important component of the long-term conservation of the species. We genotyped 26 individuals from the North American captive gorilla collection at 11 autosomal microsatellite loci in order to compare levels of genetic diversity to wild populations, investigate genetic signatures of a population bottleneck and identify the genetic structure of the captive-born population. Captive gorillas had significantly higher levels of allelic diversity (t7=4.49, P=0.002) and heterozygosity (t7=4.15, P=0.004) than comparative wild populations, yet the population has lost significant allelic diversity while in captivity when compared to founders (t7=2.44, P=0.04). Analyses suggested no genetic evidence for a population bottleneck of the captive population. Genetic structure results supported the management of North American captive gorillas as a single population. Our results highlight the utility of genetic management approaches for endangered nonhuman primate species."
Repeated innovation in great apes,"['Manrique, HM', 'Volter, CJ', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.10.026,JAN 2013,9,"Innovation has been defined as a solution to a novel problem or a novel solution to an old problem. The second part of this definition requires the inhibition of previously learnt solution strategies before a novel solution can be found. Therefore, inventing novel solutions for an old problem is considered to be particularly difficult. We investigated the ability of great apes to produce multiple new solutions to a task after each of those solutions became obsolete. We presented all four nonhuman great ape species with a task consisting of extracting a food reward from a puzzle box. Initially, the task could be solved in three different ways that varied in difficulty. After subjects discovered the first solution, we allowed them to use it for some trials and then it became obsolete. If the apes could overcome their initial response and find the next solution, we again allowed them to use it for some time and once again it became obsolete. The final step consisted of finding the third solution to secure the food reward. We found that all species except orang-utans, Pongo abelii, were able to solve all versions of the problem. Furthermore, they overcame the obsolete techniques quickly and efficiently, indicating high degrees of behavioural flexibility and inhibitory control. In contrast to previous research on social learning, our results suggest that great apes are not conservative and adjust their behaviour flexibly when the physical constraints of a task change.

Socialization of a Single Hand-Reared Tiger Cub,"['Kelling, AS', 'Bashaw, MJ', 'Bloomsmith, MA', 'Maple, TL']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,10.1080/10888705.2013.741000,JAN 1 2013,0,"Given the drawbacks of hand-rearing nonhuman animals in captivity, the practice is generally avoided, but it is sometimes necessary. A few scientific publications are available to guide managers toward best practices in hand-rearing, but the majority of articles focus on hand-rearing captive primates. Less is known about hand-rearing carnivores, but early socialization appears to be critical for adult social behavior. This article documents the successful hand-rearing and reintroduction of a single female Sumatran tiger cub at Zoo Atlanta. Reintroduction included a systematic procedure that used scent trials and introduction sessions through a barrier to gauge interest and determine whether or not aggression was a problem. Based on signs of interest, reduced stress-related behaviors, and a lack of aggression, animal managers decided to proceed with reintroduction. During the introductions, the animals were not aggressive and did occasionally interact, although typical motherinfant interactions were rare. The cub has since bred naturally and successfully delivered and reared two litters of cubs. These data suggest limited exposure to an adult tiger may be adequate socialization for normal reproduction even if it is provided relatively late in the cub's development."
Marked Population Structure and Recent Migration in the Critically Endangered Sumatran Orangutan (Pongo abelii),"['Nater, A', 'Arora, N', 'Greminger, MP', 'van Schaik, CP', 'Singleton, I', 'Wich, SA', 'Fredriksson, G', 'Perwitasari-Farajallah, D', 'Pamungkas, J', 'Krutzen, M']",JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,10.1093/jhered/ess065,JAN-FEB 2013,8,"A multitude of factors influence how natural populations are genetically structured, including dispersal barriers, inhomogeneous habitats, and social organization. Such population subdivision is of special concern in endangered species, as it may lead to reduced adaptive potential and inbreeding in local subpopulations, thus increasing the risk of future extinctions. With only 6600 animals left in the wild, Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) are among the most endangered, but also most enigmatic, great ape species. In order to infer the fine-scale population structure and connectivity of Sumatran orangutans, we analyzed the most comprehensive set of samples to date, including mitochondrial hyper-variable region I haplotypes for 123 individuals and genotypes of 27 autosomal microsatellite markers for 109 individuals. For both mitochondrial and autosomal markers, we found a pronounced population structure, caused by major rivers, mountain ridges, and the Toba caldera. We found that genetic diversity and corresponding long-term effective population size estimates vary strongly among sampling regions for mitochondrial DNA, but show remarkable similarity for autosomal markers, hinting at male-driven long-distance gene flow. In support of this, we identified several individuals that were most likely sired by males originating from other genetic clusters. Our results highlight the effect of natural barriers in shaping the genetic structure of great ape populations, but also point toward important dispersal corridors on northern Sumatra that allow for genetic exchange."
Integration of a hand-reared chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) infant into a social group of conspecifics,"['Thunstrom, M', 'Persson, T', 'Bjorklund, M']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-012-0319-1,JAN 2013,0,"Rejections of infants among non-human primates occasionally occur in the wild as well as in captive settings. Controlled adoptions of orphans and introductions of individuals into new groups are therefore sometimes necessary in captivity. Consequently, behavioral research on integration procedures and on the acceptance of infants by adoptive mothers is much needed. In this study, the introduction and subsequent adoption were examined in an 18-month-old hand-reared chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The infant was introduced into an age/sex-diversified social group of conspecifics at Furuvik Zoo, Gavle, Sweden, and continuous focal data was collected during the final stage of integration, including infant care exhibited by the group members and the infant's secure base behavior. The infant was successfully integrated into the group and engaged in positive social interactions with all group members. An adult primiparous female chimpanzee formed a bond resembling a mother-infant relationship with the infant, which continues to be maintained at publication. However, the female initially showed very limited interest in the infant. It was, in fact, two other younger female group members that exhibited most infant care. The infant's secure base behavior patterns indicate that she adapted well to the new circumstances in the chimpanzee group as the integration progressed. This provides evidence that a final adopter does not necessarily initially show maternal interest and that there can be flexibility in maternal behavior in adult chimpanzee females. Moreover, the methods applied employing gradual familiarization with all the group members and the use of an integration enclosure, may have contributed to a successful result. These findings extend our knowledge of introduction procedures in captivity as well as provide information on foster mother-infant attachment in chimpanzees."
The Taming of Not the Shrew But the Beast -Female Tamers in Contemporary South Korean Films-,['이윤종'],Contemporary Film Studies,NA,2013,0,"If the Elizabethan England has brought Shakespeare a shrew as a wild but tamable human animal, the emergence of the first woman leader/president in South Korea assigns women-on-screen a role of taming wild non-human animals. The heroines of films such as Howling (2012), A Werewolf Boy (2012), and Mr. Go (2013) advantageously domesticate such wild beasts as a dog-wolf hybrid, a werewolf, and a circus gorilla, respectively. However, this paper neither celebrates the historical elevation of women’s status nor aims at an ideological reading by identifying such fictional tamers with the new South Korean president. Rather, it pays attention to how the tamers are, along with the beasts, alienated and otherized in South Korean society, represented as an inexperienced and belittled police detective (Howling), a tuberculosis patient (A Werewolf Boy), and a mercenary Chinese circus girl (Mr. Go). Tellingly, each woman finds solace in her cultured relationship with nature, namely the beast despite a King-Kong-film-like obstruction and social prejudice against their co-habitation. Donna Haraway’s metaplasmic concept of “naturecultures” allows me to explore this aberrational domestication that “remodels” both the handlers and the animals as “companion species.” However, partly because wild beasts are far from companion animals and partly because the beasts are much more otherized and even instrumentized than the women in human society, the “co-constitution” of the kinship between them is soon ruptured and interrupted by Althusserian ideological apparatus. In considering this constitution and rupture of the natureculture and reconsidering the meaning of domestication of human (female) and non-human animals, this textual analysis addresses how the alienation/otherization is related to the gender dynamics in South Korea, just like Shakespeare’s time, in the age of its woman leader."
"Impact of human activities on Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli habitats in the Mawambi Hills, southwest Cameroon","['Etiendem, DN', 'Tagg, N', 'Hens, L', 'Pereboom, Z']",ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH,10.3354/esr00492,2013,1,"Most forest habitats in Cameroon support villages whose inhabitants are heavily reliant on the forests for their everyday needs. We assessed the socio-economic status and natural resource use of 3 villages bordering Mawambi Hills, an unprotected forest in southwest Cameroon, home to both the Critically Endangered Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli and the Endangered Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee Pan troglodytes ellioti. This forest likely hosts one of the largest sub-populations of Cross River gorillas in Cameroon and is vulnerable to human influence given that it lies in close proximity to surrounding villages and is less hilly than other Cross River gorilla habitats. We show that employment opportunities in surrounding villages are rare, and people rely on agriculture and the collection of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), such as eru Gnetum spp. and bush mango Irvingia spp., for food and income. We also show that areas of heavy human activity coincide spatially with great ape nest sites and raise concerns about the potential impact of human activities on great ape survival at the site. We call for (1) sustainable harvesting and marketing of NTFPs, (2) the introduction of alternative livelihood opportunities (e. g. beekeeping and on-farm production of NTFPs), (3) active wildlife law enforcement to safeguard the persistence of great apes, and (4) the introduction of a community-based forest management programme that will enable communities to secure the rights to use and manage surrounding forest resources legally."
Sequential Tool Use in Great Apes,"['Martin-Ordas, G', 'Schumacher, L', 'Call, J']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0052074,DEC 26 2012,4,"Sequential tool use is defined as using a tool to obtain another non-food object which subsequently itself will serve as a tool to act upon a further ( sub) goal. Previous studies have shown that birds and great apes succeed in such tasks. However, the inclusion of a training phase for each of the sequential steps and the low cost associated with retrieving the longest tools limits the scope of the conclusions. The goal of the experiments presented here was, first to replicate a previous study on sequential tool use conducted on New Caledonian crows and, second, extend this work by increasing the cost of retrieving a tool in order to test tool selectivity of apes. In Experiment 1, we presented chimpanzees, orangutans and bonobos with an out-of-reach reward, two tools that were available but too short to reach the food and four out-of-reach tools differing in functionality. Similar to crows, apes spontaneously used up to 3 tools in sequence to get the reward and also showed a strong preference for the longest out-of reach tool independently of the distance of the food. In Experiment 2, we increased the cost of reaching for the longest out-of reach tool. Now apes used up to 5 tools in sequence to get the reward and became more selective in their choice of the longest tool as the costs of its retrieval increased. The findings of the studies presented here contribute to the growing body of comparative research on tool use."
Detecting intraannual dietary variability in wild mountain gorillas by stable isotope analysis of feces,"['Blumenthal, SA', 'Chritz, KL', 'Rothman, JM', 'Cerling, TE']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1215782109,DEC 26 2012,9,"We use stable isotope ratios in feces of wild mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) to test the hypothesis that diet shifts within a single year, as measured by dry mass intake, can be recovered. Isotopic separation of staple foods indicates that intraannual changes in the isotopic composition of feces reflect shifts in diet. Fruits are isotopically distinct compared with other staple foods, and peaks in fecal delta C-13 values are interpreted as periods of increased fruit feeding. Bayesian mixing model results demonstrate that, although the timing of these diet shifts match observational data, the modeled increase in proportional fruit feeding does not capture the full shift. Variation in the isotopic and nutritional composition of gorilla foods is largely independent, highlighting the difficulty for estimating nutritional intake with stable isotopes. Our results demonstrate the potential value of fecal sampling for quantifying short-term, intraindividual dietary variability in primates and other animals with high temporal resolution even when the diet is composed of C-3 plants."
A Modular Mind? A Test Using Individual Data from Seven Primate Species,"['Amici, F', 'Barney, B', 'Johnson, VE', 'Call, J', 'Aureli, F']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0051918,DEC 19 2012,10,"It has long been debated whether the mind consists of specialized and independently evolving modules, or whether and to what extent a general factor accounts for the variance in performance across different cognitive domains. In this study, we used a hierarchical Bayesian model to re-analyse individual level data collected on seven primate species (chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, gorillas, spider monkeys, brown capuchin monkeys and long-tailed macaques) across 17 tasks within four domains (inhibition, memory, transposition and support). Our modelling approach evidenced the existence of both a domain-specific factor and a species factor, each accounting for the same amount (17%) of the observed variance. In contrast, inter-individual differences played a minimal role. These results support the hypothesis that the mind of primates is (at least partially) modular, with domain-specific cognitive skills undergoing different evolutionary pressures in different species in response to specific ecological and social demands."
Using personality ratings and cortisol to characterize individual differences in African Elephants (Loxodonta africana),"['Grand, AP', 'Kuhar, CW', 'Leighty, KA', 'Bettinger, TL', 'Laudenslager, ML']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2012.09.002,DEC 15 2012,5,"The development of indices to assist in the management of captive animals and assess their well-being is a key priority for those responsible for providing care to animals in captivity, including the zoological community. In particular, the design of indices for use with some of the more charismatic and socially complex animals, such as African elephants is a major focus. The use of personality ratings and/or cortisol measurements has become a common tool for managing farm animals and is gaining popularity within zoos. However, a combined behavioral and physiological approach has not been examined in captive African elephants (Loxodonta africana). We sought to characterize African elephants using serum and salivary cortisol measurements and our Elephant Behavior Index, a personality rating system modified from an index designed for nonhuman primates. Subjects were five adult female African elephants housed at Disney's Animal Kingdom (R). Each subject was rated on the Elephant Behavior Index, which consisted of 23 personality adjectives on a 5-point scale, by 16 raters familiar with the elephants. Saliva and blood samples were collected for cortisol analyses. Reliability across raters for the Elephant Behavior Index was established and correlations between the 23 ratings revealed four components of elephant personality: fearful, effective, sociable and aggressive. Salivary and serum cortisol were correlated and the afternoon decline in cortisol that has been documented in a variety of species was detected for both salivary and serum cortisol (morning salivary - M = 0.038, SD = 0.012; morning serum - M = 2.147, SD = 1.305; afternoon salivary - M = 0.020, SD = 0.008; afternoon serum - M = 0.445. SD = 0.251). We found positive correlations between morning cortisol levels and the fearful component and negative correlations between cortisol and effective, sociable and aggressive components. Our study demonstrated how personality ratings and cortisol can be utilized to assess individual characteristics of African elephants. Determining these unique characteristics will allow caregivers to tailor management protocols to the meet the needs of individual elephants. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved."
Does Bipedality Predict the Group-Level Manual Laterality in Mammals?,"['Giljov, A', 'Karenina, K', 'Malashichev, Y']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0051583,DEC 12 2012,4,"Background: Factors determining patterns of laterality manifestation in mammals remain unclear. In primates, the upright posture favours the expression of manual laterality across species, but may have little influence within a species. Whether the bipedalism acts the same in non-primate mammals is unknown. Our recent findings in bipedal and quadrupedal marsupials suggested that differences in laterality pattern, as well as emergence of manual specialization in evolution might depend on species-specific body posture. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that the postural characteristics are the key variable shaping the manual laterality expression across mammalian species.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied forelimb preferences in a most bipedal marsupial, brush-tailed bettong, Bettongia penicillata in four different types of unimanual behavior. The significant left-forelimb preference at the group level was found in all behaviours studied. In unimanual feeding on non-living food, catching live prey and nest-material collecting, all or most subjects were lateralized, and among lateralized bettongs a significant majority displayed left-forelimb bias. Only in unimanual supporting of the body in the tripedal stance the distribution of lateralized and non-lateralized individuals did not differ from chance. Individual preferences were consistent across all types of behaviour. The direction or the strength of forelimb preferences were not affected by the animals' sex.

Conclusions/Significance: Our findings support the hypothesis that the expression of manual laterality depends on the species-typical postural habit. The interspecies comparison illustrates that in marsupials the increase of bipedality corresponds with the increase of the degree of group-level forelimb preference in a species. Thus, bipedalism can predict pronounced manual laterality at both intra-and interspecific levels in mammals. We also conclude that quadrupedal position in biped species can slightly hinder the expression of manual laterality, but the evoked biped position in quadrupedal species does not necessarily lead to the enhanced manifestation of manual laterality."
Seasonal Effects on Great Ape Health: A Case Study of Wild Chimpanzees and Western Gorillas,"['Masi, S', 'Chauffour, S', 'Bain, O', 'Todd, A', 'Guillot, J', 'Krief, S']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0049805,DEC 5 2012,10,"Among factors affecting animal health, environmental influences may directly or indirectly impact host nutritional condition, fecundity, and their degree of parasitism. Our closest relatives, the great apes, are all endangered and particularly sensitive to infectious diseases. Both chimpanzees and western gorillas experience large seasonal variations in fruit availability but only western gorillas accordingly show large changes in their degree of frugivory. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare factors affecting health (through records of clinical signs, urine, and faecal samples) of habituated wild ape populations: a community (N = 46 individuals) of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Kanyawara, Kibale National Park (Uganda), and a western gorilla (G. gorilla) group (N = 13) in Bai Hokou in the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park (Central African Republic). Ape health monitoring was carried out in the wet and dry seasons (chimpanzees: July-December 2006; gorillas: April-July 2008 and December 2008-February 2009). Compared to chimpanzees, western gorillas were shown to have marginally greater parasite diversity, higher prevalence and intensity of both parasite and urine infections, and lower occurrence of diarrhea and wounds. Parasite infections (prevalence and load), but not abnormal urine parameters, were significantly higher during the dry season of the study period for western gorillas, who thus appeared more affected by the large temporal changes in the environment in comparison to chimpanzees. Infant gorillas were the most susceptible among all the age/sex classes (of both apes) having much more intense infections and urine blood concentrations, again during the dry season. Long term studies are needed to confirm the influence of seasonal factors on health and parasitism of these great apes. However, this study suggest climate change and forest fragmentation leading to potentially larger seasonal fluctuations of the environment may affect patterns of ape parasitism and further exacerbate health impacts on great ape populations that live in highly seasonal habitats."

Here, we further characterize the pathogenesis of the live-attenuated RABV/EBOV vaccine candidates in mice in an effort to define their growth properties and potential for safety. RABV vaccines expressing GP (RV-GP) or a replication-deficient derivative with a deletion of the RABV G gene (RV Delta G-GP) are both avirulent after intracerebral inoculation of adult mice. Furthermore, RV Delta G-GP is completely avirulent upon intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice unlike parental RABV vaccine or RV-GP. Analysis of RV Delta G-GP in the brain by quantitative PCR, determination of virus titer, and immunohistochemistry indicated greatly restricted virus replication. In summary, our findings indicate that RV-GP retains the attenuation phenotype of the live-attenuated RABV vaccine, and RV Delta G-GP would appear to be an even safer alternative for use in wildlife or consideration for human use.

Proximal Femoral Musculoskeletal Morphology of Chimpanzees and Its Evolutionary Significance: A Critique of Morimoto et al.

(Anatomical Record 2011; 294:1433-1445) concluded that the proximal femoral shaft attachment of the chimpanzee gluteus maximus (GM) lies in a position similar to that of modern humans (medial to a longitudinal bony structure that runs superoinferiorly along the lateral proximal shaft), contradicting the previous reports of similarity with the other extant apes. Based on a broader comparative osteological perspective and examination of some of the same CT imageries, we here demonstrate that: 1) although the chimpanzee insertion of the GM appears to lie more posteromedially than it does in gorillas and orangutans, the validity of the extent of this reassessment remains in doubt, pending cross-validation of CT analyses by parallel dissections of the imaged specimens, and 2) the chimpanzee and human conditions are, nevertheless, distinct. We agree with Morimoto et al. (Anatomical Record 2011; 294:1433-1445) that these observations support the interpretation that superficially similar osteological topographies of the proximal femur were acquired independently by chimpanzees and gorillas, but we disagree about the significance of their suggested human-chimpanzee similarities. Although Morimoto et al. (Anatomical Record 2011; 294:1433-1445) considered these to be shared-derived features of the chimpanzee-human clade, we instead argue that the shared absence of strong anterolateral displacement of the GM attachment among chimpanzees, basal hominids (such as Orrorin and Ardipithecus), and humans likely reflects the primitive condition characteristic of a wide range of Miocene apes.

Dental Evidence for the Reconstruction of Diet in African Early Homo,"['Ungar, PS', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFRICANUS']",CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1086/666700,DEC 2012,10,"The reconstruction of diet is important for understanding the paleoecology and evolution of early hominins. This paper reviews and colligates the fossil evidence for diets of early Homo (Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis, Homo erectus), particularly that related to tooth size, shape, structure, and wear. Technological innovations and new finds have led to improved understandings of feeding adaptations and food preferences in the earliest members of our genus. Differences in dental topography between these species and the australopiths, for example, have been documented, as have differences in microwear textures between H. habilis and H. erectus. These and other lines of evidence suggest a probable shift in diet in early Homo, and especially H. erectus, compared with their australopith forebears, with a broadened subsistence base to include foods with a wider range of fracture properties. Studies to date also make clear that while much remains to be done, early hominin teeth hold the potential to provide more detail about diet and confidence in our reconstructions as samples increase, our understanding of functional morphology improves, and other methods of analysis are applied to the fossils we have."

Phylogenetic analysis was performed on the genomes of eight representative PyVs, and showed that the bat PyVs form three distinct lineages within the genus Orthopolyomavirus and are genetically different from the previously described North American bat virus. Interestingly, two lineages cluster with PyVs found in chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas. In addition, one group of bat PyVs is genetically related to the human Merkel cell polyomavirus."
COMPARISON OF LARYNGEAL MASK AIRWAY USE WITH ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION DURING ANESTHESIA OF WESTERN LOWLAND GORILLAS (GORILLA GORILLA GORILLA),"['Cerveny, SN', ""D'Agostino, JJ"", 'Davis, MR', 'Payton, ME']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,DEC 2012,1,"The laryngeal mask airway is an alternative to endotracheal intubation that achieves control of the airway by creating a seal around the larynx with an inflatable cuff. This study compared use of the laryngeal mask airway with endotracheal intubation in anesthetized western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Eight adult gorillas were immobilized for routine and diagnostic purposes for a total of nine anesthetic events. During each anesthetic event, gorillas were either intubated (n = 4; group A) or fitted with a laryngeal mask airway (n = 5; group B). Time required to place each airway device, physiologic parameters, and arterial blood gas were measured and compared between the two groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups for time required to place airway device, heart rate, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, or arterial pH between the two groups. Mean arterial partial pressure of oxygen was significantly greater in group B, 15 (group A: 94 +/- 44 mm Hg; group B: 408 +/- 36 mm Hg; P = 0.0025) and 45 (group A: 104 +/- 21 mm Hg; group B: 407 +/- 77 mm Hg; P = 0.0026) min after airway device placement. Mean respiratory rate was significantly greater in group A at multiple time points. Mean arterial pressure (group A: 129 +/- 16 mm Hg; group B: 60 +/- 8 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (group A: 115 +/- 21 mm Hg; group B: 36 +/- 10 mm Hg) were significantly greater in group A at the time of airway device placement. The laryngeal mask airway maintained oxygenation and ventilation effectively in all gorillas and is a useful alternative to endotracheal intubation in western lowland gorillas."
A New Isolation with Migration Model along Complete Genomes Infers Very Different Divergence Processes among Closely Related Great Ape Species,"['Mailund, T', 'Halager, AE', 'Westergaard, M', 'Dutheil, JY', 'Munch, K', 'Andersen, LN', 'Lunter, G', 'Prufer, K', 'Scally, A', 'Hobolth, A', 'Schierup, MH']",PLOS GENETICS,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003125,DEC 2012,28,"We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) for inferring gradual isolation between two populations during speciation, modelled as a time interval with restricted gene flow. The HMM describes the history of adjacent nucleotides in two genomic sequences, such that the nucleotides can be separated by recombination, can migrate between populations, or can coalesce at variable time points, all dependent on the parameters of the model, which are the effective population sizes, splitting times, recombination rate, and migration rate. We show by extensive simulations that the HMM can accurately infer all parameters except the recombination rate, which is biased downwards. Inference is robust to variation in the mutation rate and the recombination rate over the sequence and also robust to unknown phase of genomes unless they are very closely related. We provide a test for whether divergence is gradual or instantaneous, and we apply the model to three key divergence processes in great apes: (a) the bonobo and common chimpanzee, (b) the eastern and western gorilla, and (c) the Sumatran and Bornean orang-utan. We find that the bonobo and chimpanzee appear to have undergone a clear split, whereas the divergence processes of the gorilla and orang-utan species occurred over several hundred thousands years with gene flow stopping quite recently. We also apply the model to the Homo/Pan speciation event and find that the most likely scenario involves an extended period of gene flow during speciation."

Social tolerance and adult play in macaque societies: a comparison with different human cultures,"['Ciani, F', ""Dall'Olio, S"", 'Stanyon, R', 'Palagi, E']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.09.002,DEC 2012,10,"Differences in play behaviour often illuminate complex ecological parameters and social differences. In primate societies, including humans, individuals acquire information through play. It is adults in every community that are most committed to managing social practices. In tolerant species, adults often participate in play to reinforce social networks and cooperation. The 20 macaque species are all organized in multimale, multifemale groups but vary along a continuum from despotic/intolerant to egalitarian/tolerant social systems. These different social styles influence a wide range of behaviours including aggression and affiliation patterns, dominance relationships, and nepotism. We tested some hypotheses by comparing play patterns in two macaque societies at opposite ends of the continuum: despotic Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, and tolerant Tonkean macaques, Macaca tonkeana. Our results show that these two species have striking differences in the distribution of social play according to the age and sex of the players. Our findings strongly indicate that play, a highly plastic and versatile behaviour, is sensitive to the quality of interindividual relationships of a species, thus reflecting the nature of its social network. The different patterns of macaque play show striking parallels with those from comparisons of different human cultures including the distribution of social play according to the age and gender, partner preference according to age, and permissiveness of mothers. The adult play propensity of Tonkean compared to Japanese macaques indicates that adult-adult play is a good predictor for the polarity of changes in aggressiveness between different groups separated either genetically (taxa) or culturally (ethnies).

"Evolutionary Relationships Among Robust and Gracile Australopiths: An ""Evo-devo"" Perspective","['Gunz, P']",EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1007/s11692-012-9185-4,DEC 2012,5,"Hominin fossils of gracile and robust australopith groups were found both in East and in South Africa. It is unclear, however, whether all robusts belong to a monophyletic Paranthropus clade, as the craniofacial resemblance among robust australopiths might only be a superficial correlate of similar masticatory adaptations and not evidence of shared ancestry. It has been suggested that the East African Australopithecus/Paranthropus boisei and the South African A./P. robustus might be convergent allometric variants of their gracile geographical neighbors A. afarensis and A. africanus. Here we approach the phylogenetic questions about robust and gracile australopiths from an ""evo-devo"" perspective, examining how simple alterations of development could contribute to the shape differences among hominin species. Using geometric morphometrics we compare gracile and robust australopith crania in the context of the allometric scaling patterns of Pan troglodytes, P. paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla. We examine support for two alternative evolutionary scenarios based on predictions derived from quantitative genetics models: either (1) A./P. robustus evolved in South Africa from the gracile A. africanus, or (2) A./P. robustus is a local variant of the eastern African A./P. boisei. We use developmental simulations to demonstrate that some robust characteristics (wide faces, anteriorly placed zygomatics, and facial dishing) can be predicted by allometric scaling along the ontogenetic trajectory of the gracile A. africanus. We find, however, that the facial differences between A. africanus specimens (Taung, Sts 5, Sts 71, and Stw 505) and A./P. robustus specimen SK 48 cannot be explained by allometric scaling alone. Facial shape differences between A./P. robustus SK 48 and A./P. boisei (KNM-ER 732, KNM-ER 406, OH 5) and the A./P. aethiopicus specimen KNM-WT 17000, on the other hand, can largely be explained by allometric scaling. This is consistent with a close evolutionary relationship of these robust taxa."
Evolutionary Development in Australopithecus africanus,"['McNulty, KP', 'TAUNG CHILD']",EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1007/s11692-012-9172-9,DEC 2012,5,"Evolutionary developmental biology is quickly transforming our understanding of how lineages evolve through the modification of ontogenetic processes. Yet, while great strides have been made in the study of neontological forms, it is much more difficult to apply the principles of evo-devo to the miserly fossil record. Because fossils are static entities, we as researchers can only infer evolution and development by drawing connections between them. The choices of how we join specimens together-juveniles to adults to study ontogeny, taxon to taxon to study evolution-can dramatically affect our results. Here, I examine paedomorphism in the fossil hominin species Australopithecus africanus. Using extant African apes as proxies for ancestral hominin morphology, I demonstrate that Sts 71 is most similar to a sub-adult African ape, suggesting that A. africanus is paedomorphic relative to the presumed ancestral form. I then plot ontogenetic size and shape in extant great apes, humans, and A. africanus in order to assess patterns of ontogenetic allometry. Results indicate that ontogenetic allometry in A. africanus, subsequent to M1 occlusion is similar to that in modern humans and bonobos; gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans share a different pattern of size-shape relationship. Combined with results from the analysis of paedomorphism plus knowledge about the developmental chronologies of this group, these findings suggest that paedomorphism in A. africanus arises relatively early in ontogeny."
"Nutritional composition of actual and potential insect prey for the Kasekela chimpanzees of Gombe National Park, Tanzania","[""O'Malley, RC"", 'Power, ML']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22151,DEC 2012,13,"Humans, all great ape species, and some lesser apes consume insects. Insects can provide comparable nutritional yields to meat on a gram-for-gram basis and may serve as an important source of energy, fat, protein, minerals, and vitamins for hominoids. Although potential insect prey are abundant in ape habitats, patterns of insectivory are not consistent across species or populations. Efforts to understand these patterns are complicated by a lack of nutritional data. We collected samples of insects consumed by the Kasekela chimpanzee community of Gombe National Park, Tanzania, as well as of some insects found within the community range and ignored by these chimpanzees but known to be preyed upon by Pan elsewhere. We determined the gross energy (GE), estimated metabolizable energy (ME), fat, protein, fiber, and ash content of these samples following standard methodologies. We use these data to test the hypothesis that Kasekela chimpanzees choose insect prey (at least in part) based on energy and/or macronutrient content. On a fresh-weight, per-gram basis, the insect prey consumed by Kasekela chimpanzees had significantly higher fat and lower ash content than other assayed insects, and on a fresh-weight, per-foraging-unit (per-insect, per-dip, or per-nest) basis were significantly higher in GE, fat, and protein. On a per-gram basis, the assayed insects were generally comparable in energy and macronutrients to wild vertebrate meat. We conclude that Kasekela chimpanzees do favor insects that are high in energy, fat, and protein, and that the potential macronutrient yields from some forms of insectivory are not trivial.

Genetic Characterization of Simian Foamy Viruses Infecting Humans,"['Rua, R', 'Betsem, E', 'Calattini, S', 'Saib, A', 'Gessain, A']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.01715-12,DEC 2012,9,"Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are retroviruses that are widespread among nonhuman primates (NHPs). SFVs actively replicate in their oral cavity and can be transmitted to humans after NHP bites, giving rise to a persistent infection even decades after primary infection. Very few data on the genetic structure of such SFVs found in humans are available. In the framework of ongoing studies searching for SFV-infected humans in south Cameroon rainforest villages, we studied 38 SFV-infected hunters whose times of infection had presumably been determined. By long-term cocultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with BHK-21 cells, we isolated five new SFV strains and obtained complete genomes of SFV strains from chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes; strains BAD327 and AG15), monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans; strain AG16), and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla; strains BAK74 and BAD468). These zoonotic strains share a very high degree of similarity with their NHP counterparts and have a high degree of conservation of the genetic elements important for viral replication. Interestingly, analysis of FV DNA sequences obtained before cultivation revealed variants with deletions in both the U3 region and tas that may correlate with in vivo chronicity in humans. Genomic changes in bet (a premature stop codon) and gag were also observed. To determine if such changes were specific to zoonotic strains, we studied local SFV-infected chimpanzees and found the same genomic changes. Our study reveals that natural polymorphism of SFV strains does exist at both the intersubspecies level (gag, bet) and the intrasubspecies (U3, tas) levels but does not seem to reflect a viral adaptation specific to zoonotic SFV strains."
Variation in the Social Systems of Extant Hominoids: Comparative Insight into the Social Behavior of Early Hominins,"['Malone, N', 'Fuentes, A', 'White, FJ']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-012-9617-0,DEC 2012,5,"The observed social systems of extant apes and humans suggest that the common ancestral state for Miocene hominoids was living in multimale-multifemale groups that exhibited a tendency to fission and fusion in response to ecological and/or social variables. The Hominoidea share a set of social commonalities, notably a social niche that extends beyond kin and beyond the immediate social group, as well as extensive intraspecific flexibility in social organization. We propose that an essential feature of hominoid evolution is the shift from limited plasticity in a generalized social ape to expanded behavioral plasticity as an adaptive niche. Whereas in most nonhominoid primates variability and flexibility take the shape of specific patterns of demographic flux and interindividual relationships, we can consider behavioral flexibility and plasticity as a means to an end in hominoid socioecological landscapes. In addition, the potential for innovation, spread, and inheritance of behavioral patterns and social traditions is much higher in the hominoids, especially the great apes, than in other anthropoid primates. We further suggest that this pattern forms a basis for the substantial expansion of social complexity and adaptive behavioral plasticity in the hominins, especially the genus Homo. Our objectives in this article are threefold: 1) summarize the variation in the social systems of extant hominoid taxa; 2) consider the evolutionary processes underlying these variations; and 3) expand upon the traditional socioecological model, especially with respect to reconstructions of early hominin social behavior. We emphasize a central role for both ecological and social niche construction, as well as behavioral plasticity, as basal hominoid characteristics. Over evolutionary time these characteristics influence the patterns of selection pressures and the resulting social structures. We propose that a mosaic of ecological and social inheritance patterns should be considered in the reconstruction of early hominin social systems."
"Tandem repeat sequences evolutionarily related to SVA-type retrotransposons are expanded in the centromere region of the western hoolock gibbon, a small ape","['Hara, T', 'Hirai, Y', 'Jahan, I', 'Hirai, H', 'Koga, A']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS,10.1038/jhg.2012.107,DEC 2012,4,"Hoolock hoolock (the western hoolock gibbon) is a species of the family Hylobatidae (small apes), which constitutes the superfamily Hominoidea (hominoids) together with Hominidae (great apes and human). Here, we report that centromeres or their vicinities in this gibbon species contain tandem repeat sequences that consist of 35-50-bp repeat units, and exhibit a sequence similarity with the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) region of the SVA, LAVA and PVA transposons. SVA is a composite retrotransposon thought to have been formed by fusion of three solo elements in the common ancestor of hominoids. LAVA and PVA are recently identified retrotransposons that have the same basic structure as SVA. Thus, the large-scale tandem repeats in the centromere region may have been derived from one or more of SVA-type transposons, including the three mentioned above and other yet unknown elements, or the repeat sequences could have served as a source for such elements. Amplification of VNTR-related sequences in another gibbon species, Hoolock leuconedys (eastern hoolock gibbon), has recently been reported, but it is yet to be examined whether the large-scale tandem repeats observed in the two species originated from a single event that occurred in their common ancestor. The repeat sequences in the western hoolock gibbon are mostly 40 kb or more in length, are present in 28 of the 38 chromosomes of the somatic cells, and are homozygous for chromosomal presence/absence.

Ectocranial suture fusion in primates: as related to cranial volume and dental eruption,"['Cray, J', 'Cooper, GM', 'Mooney, MP', 'Siegel, MI']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1111/jmp.12018,DEC 2012,6,"Background Timing of calvarial suture fusion is important in primate ontogeny. Ages at death are difficult to assess especially for museum collections. Methods 1550 skulls of Hominoid, Hylobatidae, Macaca and Papio were observed for fusion. Calvarial expansion (early) and dental eruption (late) were utilized as indicators of ontogeny. Homogeneity of slopes and ANOVA were used to determine differences in timing of fusion. Results For calvarial growth the great apes all showed small levels of calvarial suture remodeling prior to full calvarial expansion. For dental eruption, Homo and Macaca share a common pattern of fusion in late adulthood. The other species show early remodeling. Papio was observed to have distinct patterns for suture fusion progression. Conclusions Thus, suture fusion progression although influenced by evolutionary changes in the robusticity of the craniofacial skeleton can be modeled by the phylogeny among this group. Overall, Homo appears to have a distinct pattern of delayed suture fusion progression."
Metabolic constraint imposes tradeoff between body size and number of brain neurons in human evolution,"['Fonseca-Azevedo, K', 'Herculano-Houzel, S']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1206390109,NOV 6 2012,26,"Despite a general trend for larger mammals to have larger brains, humans are the primates with the largest brain and number of neurons, but not the largest body mass. Why are great apes, the largest primates, not also those endowed with the largest brains? Recently, we showed that the energetic cost of the brain is a linear function of its numbers of neurons. Here we show that metabolic limitations that result from the number of hours available for feeding and the low caloric yield of raw foods impose a tradeoff between body size and number of brain neurons, which explains the small brain size of great apes compared with their large body size. This limitation was probably overcome in Homo erectus with the shift to a cooked diet. Absent the requirement to spend most available hours of the day feeding, the combination of newly freed time and a large number of brain neurons affordable on a cooked diet may thus have been a major positive driving force to the rapid increased in brain size in human evolution."
Ecological Volatility and Human Evolution: A Novel Perspective on Life History and Reproductive Strategy,"['Wells, JCK']",EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/evan.21334,NOV-DEC 2012,4,"Humans are characterized by a suite of traits that seem to differentiate them profoundly from closely related apes such as the gorilla, chimpanzee, and orang-utan. These traits include longevity, cooperative breeding, stacking of offspring, lengthy maturation, and a complex life-course profile of adiposity. When, how, and why these traits emerged during our evolutionary history is currently attracting considerable attention. Most approaches to life history emphasize dietary energy availability and the risk of mortality as the two key stresses shaping life-history variability between and within species. The high energy costs of the large Homo brain are also seen as the central axis around which other life-history traits were reorganized. I propose that ecological volatility may have been a key stress, selecting in favor of the suite of traits in order to tolerate periods of energy scarcity, and increase reproductive output during periods of good conditions. Theses life-history adaptations may have preceded and enabled the trend toward encephalization."
NANOGP8: Evolution of a Human-Specific Retro-Oncogene,"['Fairbanks, DJ', 'Fairbanks, AD', 'Ogden, TH', 'Parker, GJ', 'Maughan, PJ']",G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS,10.1534/g3.112.004366,NOV 1 2012,9,"NANOGP8 is a human (Homo sapiens) retrogene, expressed predominantly in cancer cells where its protein product is tumorigenic. It arose through retrotransposition from its parent gene, NANOG, which is expressed predominantly in embryonic stem cells. Based on identification of fixed and polymorphic variants in a genetically diverse set of human NANOG and NANOGP8 sequences, we estimated the evolutionary origin of NANOGP8 at approximately 0.9 to 2.5 million years ago, more recent than previously estimated. We also discovered that NANOGP8 arose from a derived variant allele of NANOG containing a 22-nucleotide pair deletion in the 3' UTR, which has remained polymorphic in modern humans. Evidence from our experiments indicates that NANOGP8 is fixed in modern humans even though its parent allele is polymorphic. The presence of NANOGP8-specific sequences in Neanderthal reads provided definitive evidence that NANOGP8 is also present in the Neanderthal genome. Some variants between the reference sequences of NANOG and NANOGP8 utilized in cancer research to distinguish RT-PCR products are polymorphic within NANOG or NANOGP8 and thus are not universally reliable as distinguishing features. NANOGP8 was inserted in reverse orientation into the LTR region of an SVA retroelement that arose in a human-chimpanzee-gorilla common ancestor after divergence of the orangutan ancestral lineage. Transcription factor binding sites within and beyond this LTR may promote expression of NANOGP8 in cancer cells, although current evidence is inferential. The fact that NANOGP8 is a human-specific retro-oncogene may partially explain the higher genetic predisposition for cancer in humans compared with other primates."
African Plasmodium vivax: Distribution and origins,"['Culleton, R', 'Carter, R']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/j.ijpara.2012.08.005,NOV 2012,8,"There is increasing evidence that the malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax, is endemic in west and central Africa, a region from which it was previously thought to be almost completely absent due to the very high prevalence of the Duffy negative phenotype in the local human populations. Furthermore, P. vivax, or very closely related parasites, has been identified in both chimpanzees and gorillas from this region. In this review, we discuss the implications of these findings for the current understanding of the origins of P. vivax as a human parasite. With the support of new evidence from mitochondrial genome sequencing, we propose that the evidence is consistent with current, extant P. vivax populations having their origins in Africa.

"Remote video-camera traps measure habitat use and competitive exclusion among sympatric chimpanzee, gorilla and elephant in Loango National Park, Gabon","['Head, JS', 'Robbins, MM', 'Mundry, R', 'Makaga, L', 'Boesch, C']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,10.1017/S0266467412000612,NOV 2012,9,"Species commonly exist in sympatry, yet ecological studies are often based on a single species approach while ignoring the impact of sympatric competitors. Over 13 mo we used 24 remote video-camera traps to monitor habitat use of sympatric chimpanzee, gorilla and elephant in four different habitat types in Loango National Park, Gabon. Habitat use by each species was predicted to vary according to seasonal changes in food availability and precipitation. Increased interspecific competition between the three species was expected at times of reduced resource availability, leading to exclusion of the inferior competitor. Supporting the predictions, species abundance per habitat showed seasonal variation: all three species responded positively to increased fruit availability in all habitats, but the response was only significant for gorilla in mature forest and elephant in coastal forest. Responses to rainfall varied, with the chimpanzee responding negatively to rainfall in swamp forest, the gorilla responding positively to rainfall in coastal and secondary forest, and the elephant responding positively to rainfall in mature forest. Elephant presence resulted in competitive exclusion of the apes under certain conditions: the chimpanzee was excluded by the elephant where fruit availability was low, whereas the gorilla was excluded by the elephant in areas of low herb density despite high fruit availability. Our results emphasize the value of applying a multi-species, longer-term approach to studying variation in habitat use among sympatric species and highlight the impact competitors can exert on one another's distribution."
Estrogenic plant consumption predicts red colobus monkey (Procolobus rufomitratus) hormonal state and behavior,"['Wasserman, MD', 'Chapman, CA', 'Milton, K', 'Gogarten, JF', 'Wittwer, DJ', 'Ziegler, TE']",HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR,10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.09.005,NOV 2012,4,"Numerous studies have examined the effects of anthropogenic endocrine disrupting compounds; however, very little is known about the effects of naturally occurring plant-produced estrogenic compounds (i.e., phytoestrogens) on vertebrates. To examine the seasonal pattern of phytoestrogen consumption and its relationship to hormone levels (407 fecal samples analyzed for estradiol and cortisol) and social behavior (aggression, mating, and grooming) in a primate, we conducted an 11-month field study of red colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. The percent of diet from estrogenic plants averaged 10.7% (n = 45 weeks; range: 0.7-32.4%). Red colobus fed more heavily on estrogenic Millettia dura young leaves during weeks of higher rainfall, and the consumption of this estrogenic item was positively correlated to both their fecal estradiol and cortisol levels. Social behaviors were related to estradiol and cortisol levels, as well as the consumption of estrogenic plants and rainfall. The more the red colobus consumed estrogenic plants the higher their rates of aggression and copulation and the lower their time spent grooming. Our results suggest that the consumption of estrogenic plants has important implications for primate health and fitness through interactions with the endocrine system and changes in hormone levels and social behaviors.

"Apes (Gorilla gorilla, Pan paniscus, P. troglodytes, Pongo abelii) Versus Corvids (Corvus corax, C. corone) in a Support Task: The Effect of Pattern and Functionality","['Albiach-Serrano, A', 'Bugnyar, T', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0028050,NOV 2012,10,"Apes (Gorilla gorilla, Pan paniscus, P. troglodytes, Pang abelii) and corvids (Corms corax, C. corone) are among the most proficient and flexible tool users in the animal kingdom. Although it has been proposed that this is the result of convergent evolution, little is known about whether this is limited to behavior or also includes the underlying cognitive mechanisms. We compared several species of apes (bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans) and corvids (carrion crows and common ravens) using exactly the same paradigm: a support task with elements from the classical patterned-string tasks. Corvids proved able to solve at least an easy pattern, whereas apes outperformed corvids with respect to the complexity of the patterns solved, the relative number of subjects solving each problem, and the speed to reach criterion. We addressed the question of whether subjects based their choices purely on perceptual cues or on a more abstract understanding of the problem. This was done by using a perceptually very similar but causally different condition where instead of paper strips there were strip shapes painted on a platform. Corvids' performance did not differ between conditions, whereas apes were able to solve the real but not the painted task. This shows that apes were not basing their choices just on spatial or arbitrary perceptual cues. Instead, and unlike corvids, they must have had some causal knowledge of the task."
Spatial Memory in Captive American Black Bears (Ursus americanus),"['Zamisch, V', 'Vonk, J']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0028081,NOV 2012,2,"The spatial memory and foraging strategies of four adult captive-born American black bears (Ursus americanus) were explored in four experiments using a simulated foraging task. In the first three experiments, each session consisted of two phases separated by a delay: During the exploration phase, subjects foraged among a set of baited and unbaited sites. During the delay, the same locations were rebaited and subjects were released again and allowed to search the sites (search phase). In Experiments 1a and 1b, different sites were baited each day and the interval between exploration and search was short (4 hr or 15 min). Subjects were not accurate at recovering the food items in either experiment. In Experiment 2, an ""informed forager"" paradigm was used in which one subject was given privileged knowledge about the location of the food during the exploration phase and was later released with an ""uninformed"" competitor during the search phase. The bears did not achieve above-chance recovery accuracy even in the presence of a competitor. In Experiment 3, the same two of four sites were continually baited and the bears were released simultaneously over a period of 20 days, with each baiting separated by 2 or 3 days. As a group, the bears' foraging accuracy with repeated baiting and longer intervals approached greater than chance accuracy. Results suggest some limitations on bears' use of spatial memory in captive environments, but reveal the potential for use of spatial memory over longer delays."

How are humans and closely related species such as great apes similar and different in their viewing patterns for faces and eyes? Following previous studies comparing chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with humans (Homo sapiens), this study used the eye-tracking method to directly compare the patterns of face and eye scanning by humans, gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), and orangutans (Pongo abelii). Human and ape participants freely viewed pictures of whole bodies and full faces of conspecifics and allospecifics under the same experimental conditions. All species were strikingly similar in that they viewed predominantly faces and eyes. No particular difference was identified between gorillas and orangutans, and they also did not differ from the chimpanzees tested in previous studies. However, humans were somewhat different from apes, especially with respect to prolonged eye viewing. We also examined how species-specific facial morphologies, such as the male flange of orangutans and the black white contrast of human eyes, affected viewing patterns. Whereas the male flange of orangutans affected viewing patterns, the color contrast of human eyes did not Humans showed prolonged eye viewing independently of the eye color of presented faces, indicating that this pattern is internally driven rather than stimulus dependent Overall, the results show general similarities among the species and also identify unique eye-viewing patterns in humans."
Non-invasive monitoring of physiological stress in the Western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla): Validation of a fecal glucocorticoid assay and methods for practical application in the field,"['Shutt, K', 'Setchell, JM', 'Heistermann, M', 'PROPITHECUS-VERREAUXI']",GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY,10.1016/j.ygcen.2012.08.008,NOV 1 2012,19,"Enzymeimmunoassays (EIAs) allow researchers to monitor stress hormone output via measurement of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGCMs) in many vertebrates. They can be powerful tools which allow the acquisition of otherwise unobtainable physiological information from both captive animals and wild animals in remote forest habitats, such as great apes. However, methods for hormone measurement, extraction and preservation need to be adapted and validated for field settings. In preparation for a field study of Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in the Central African Republic we used samples from captive gorillas collected around opportunistic stressful situations to test whether four different glucocorticoid EIAs reflected adrenocortical activity reliably and to establish the lag-time from the stressor to peak excretion. We also validated a field extraction technique and established a simple, non-freezer-reliant method to preserve FGCMs in extracts long-term. We determined the rate of FGCM change over 28 days when samples cannot be extracted immediately and over 12 h when feces cannot be preserved immediately in alcohol. Finally, we used repeat samples from identified individuals to test for diurnal variation in FGCM output. Two group-specific assays measuring major cortisol metabolites detected the predicted FGCM response to the stressor reliably, whereas more specific cortisol and corticosterone assays were distinctly less responsive and thus less useful. We detected a lag time of 2-3 days from stressor to peak FGCM excretion. Our field extraction method performed as well as an established laboratory extraction method and FGCMs in dried extracts stored at ambient temperatures were as stable as those at -20 degrees C over 1 yr. Hormones in non-extracted feces in alcohol were stable up to 28 days at ambient temperatures. FGCMs in un-fixed gorilla feces deteriorated to almost 50% of the original values within 6 h under field conditions. We detected no diurnal variation in FGCMs in samples from wild gorillas. Our study highlights the importance of thorough biological and immunological validation of FGCM assays, and presents validated, practical methods for the application of non-invasive adrenocortical monitoring techniques to field conservation contexts where it is crucially needed.

Scheuermann Kyphosis in Nonhuman Primates,"['Farrell, BM', 'Kuo, CC', 'Tang, JA', 'Phan, S', 'Buckley, JM', 'Kondrashov, DG', 'MILWAUKEE-BRACE TREATMENT']",SPINE,10.1097/BRS.0b013e31826f2255,NOV 1 2012,2,"Study Design. A cadaveric survey of the thoracic spines of extant species of nonbipedal primates for the presence of Scheuermann kyphosis.

Objective. To determine the presence and prevalence of Scheuermann kyphosis in quadrupedal species of the closest living relatives to humans to demonstrate that bipedalism is not an absolute requirement for the development of Scheuermann kyphosis.

Summary of Background Data. The etiology of Scheuermann kyphosis remains poorly understood. Biomechanical factors associated with upright posture are thought to play a role in the development of the disorder. To date, Scheuermann kyphosis has been described only in humans and extinct species of bipedal hominids.

Methods. Thoracic vertebrae from 92 specimens of Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee) and 105 specimens of Gorilla gorilla (gorilla) from the Hamann-Todd Osteological Collection at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History were examined for Scheuermann kyphosis on the basis of Sorenson criteria and the presence of anterior vertebral body extensions and for the presence of Schmorl nodes.

Results. Two specimens of P. troglodytes (2.2%) were found to have anatomic features consistent with Scheuermann kyphosis including vertebral body wedging greater than 5 at 3 or more adjacent levels and the presence of anterior vertebral body extensions. One of the affected specimens (50%) demonstrated the presence of Schmorl nodes whereas 2 of the unaffected specimens (2.2%) had Schmorl nodes. None of the specimens of G. gorilla (0%) were found to have anterior vertebral body extensions characteristic of Scheuermann kyphosis or Schmorl nodes.

Conclusion. Thoracic kyphotic deformity consistent with Scheuermann kyphosis exists in quadrupedal nonhuman primates. Bipedalism is not a strict requirement for the development of Scheuermann kyphosis, and the evolutionary origins of the disease predate the vertebral adaptations of bipedal locomotion."
Infanticide risk and male quality influence optimal group composition for Colobus vellerosus,"['Teichroeb, JA', 'Wikberg, EC', 'Badescu, I', 'Macdonald, LJ', 'Sicotte, P']",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,10.1093/beheco/ars128,NOV-DEC 2012,6,"The threat of infanticide by males is suggested to determine upper group size limits for some folivores because large female aggregations attract immigrating males. When groups get large enough to become multimale, infanticide risk should decline because, all other things being equal, more males should deter outside takeovers and the counterstrategies of mothers and sires should lower the consequences of inside takeovers. To determine if this scenario can be generalized to all folivorous primates, we began by examining the influence of female and male group size on 4 increasing levels of infanticide risk in folivorous ursine colobus monkeys (Colobus vellerosus) at Boabeng-Fiema, Ghana. Data from 2004 to 2010 on 7 groups analyzed with generalized estimating equation models showed that infanticide risk is heightened in groups with more females and absolutely more males because male immigration is more frequent. However, when controlling for the effect of female group size on male group size, groups with relatively more males have significantly more male immigration and higher infanticide rates. Thus, multimale groups of C. vellerosus show higher infanticide risk compared with unimale groups. Resident males in unimale groups may be higher quality than those in multimale groups because they perform more energetically costly displays and win more encounters. However, males in multimale groups may also suffer from collective action problems making them unable to prevent male immigration and infanticide. This study highlights the importance of the quality of male defenders in infanticide risk and demonstrates intersexual and intrasexual conflict in group composition in C. vellerosus."

Methods: One hundred thirty-eight genetically unrelated subjects, with multicolor phenotype, were selected from the southeast region of Brazil. Skin, hair and eye color, and tanning ability were rated. Genotypes for each SNP (rs3212345:C>T and rs3212346:G>A) were determined. A logistic regression analysis was performed with the additive model to determine which of the polymorphisms contributed to a specific phenotype. Results: We found that the rs3212345:C>T is associated with light skin, red hair, and poor tanning ability, while the rs3212346:G>A is associated with dark skin, black hair, and strong tanning ability. The presence of rs3212345-C and rs3212346-A alleles in human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and marmoset genomes suggests that they are the ancestral alleles. Conclusion: These data suggest that the rs3212345-T and rs3212346-G alleles may have contributed to lighter pigmentation phenotypes in modern humans. Genotyping for these SNPs may prove useful to the fields of molecular anthropology and forensic genetics. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
"Quantifying lateral femoral condyle ellipticalness in chimpanzees, gorillas, and humans","['Sylvester, AD', 'Pfisterer, T', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22144,NOV 2012,1,"Articular surfaces of limb bones provide information for understanding animal locomotion because their size and shape are a reflection of habitual postures and movements. Here we present a novel method for quantifying the ellipticalness (i.e., departure from perfectly circular) of the lateral femoral condyle (LFC), applying this technique to hominid femora. Three-dimensional surface models were created for 49 Homo sapiens, 34 Pan troglodytes and 25 Gorilla gorilla femora. Software was developed that fit separate cylinders to each of the femoral condyles. These cylinders were constrained to have a single axis, but could have different radii. The cylinder fit to the LFC was allowed to assume an elliptical cross-section, while the cylinder fit to the medial condyle was constrained to remain circular. The shape of the elliptical cylinder (ratio of the major and minor axes of the ellipse) was recorded, and the orientation of the elliptical cylinder quantified as angles between the major axis of the ellipse and the anatomical and mechanical axes of the femur. Species were compared using analysis of variance and post hoc multiple comparisons tests. Confirming qualitative descriptions, human LFCs are more elliptical than those of chimpanzees and gorillas. Human femora exhibit a narrow range for the angle between the major axis of the elliptical cylinder and femoral axes.

Target animacy influences chimpanzee handedness,"['Forrester, GS', 'Quaresmini, C', 'Leavens, DA', 'Spiezio, C', 'Vallortigara, G']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-012-0536-4,NOV 2012,20,"We employed a bottom-up, quantitative method to investigate great ape handedness. Our previous investigation of gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) demonstrated that contextual information influenced an individual's handedness toward target objects. Specifically, we found a significant right-hand bias for unimanual actions directed toward inanimate target objects but not for actions directed to animate target objects (Forrester et al. in Anim Cogn 14(6):903-907, 2011). Using the identical methodological technique, we investigated the spontaneous hand actions of nine captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) during naturalistic, spontaneous behavior. We assessed both the frequencies and proportions of lateralized hand actions directed toward animate and inanimate targets employing focal follow video sampling. Like the gorillas, the chimpanzees demonstrated a right-handed bias for actions directed toward inanimate targets, but not toward animate targets. This pattern was evident at the group level and for the majority of subjects at the individual level. We postulate that a right-hand bias for only inanimate targets reflects the left hemisphere's dominant neural processing capabilities for objects that have functional properties (inanimate objects). We further speculate that a population-level right-hand bias is not a human-unique characteristic, but one that was inherited from a common human-ape ancestor."
Social housing of surplus males of Javan langurs(Trachypithecus auratus): Compatibility of intact and castrated males in different social settings,"['Droscher, I', 'Waitt, CD']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2012.08.001,NOV 2012,1,"Javan langurs (Trachypithecus auratus) naturally form social groups containing typically only one adult male. However, this social system is problematic with regard to captive management, as it can lead to the production of surplus males. The study assessed if castration is a feasible strategy to allow social housing of male surplus individuals in bachelor pairs and mixed-sex groups. Behavioural data were collected during a 7-week study for a total of 173 h in Howletts & Port Lympne Wild Animal Parks (UK). Males in three bachelor pairs, as well as males in four mixed-sex groups were observed. With the exception of one bachelor pair of intact males, and one-mixed sex group containing only castrated males, the study groups included a single intact male, with the remaining males being castrated. In bachelor pairs, males compensated for a lack of other social partners by an increase in affiliative male-male interactions. In mixed-sex groups, the presence of females did not lead to an increase in agonistic male-male interactions. However, males gave preference to females over males as social partners. In general, castrated males displayed more submissive, while intact males displayed more dominance behaviours, indicating that castration affects the social status in Javan langurs. The results of the study suggest that castration can be used as a managerial tool to allow surplus males to remain as subordinate follower males in bachelor pairs as well as mixed-sex groups to provide socialisation and companionship.

Recent decline in suitable environmental conditions for African great apes,"['Junker, J', 'Blake, S', 'Boesch, C', 'Campbell, G', 'du Toit, L', 'Duvall, C', 'Ekobo, A', 'Etoga, G', 'Galat-Luong, A', 'Gamys, J', 'Ganas-Swaray, J', 'Gatti, S', 'Ghiurghi, A', 'Granier, N', 'Hart, J', 'Head, J', 'Herbinger, I', 'Hicks, TC', 'Huijbregts, B', 'Imong, IS', 'Kuempel, N', 'Lahm, S', 'Lindsell, J', 'Maisels, F', 'McLennan, M', 'Martinez, L', 'Morgan, B', 'Morgan, D', 'Mulindahabi, F', 'Mundry, R', ""N'Goran, KP"", 'Normand, E', 'Ntongho, A', 'Okon, DT', 'Petre, CA', 'Plumptre, A', 'Rainey, H', 'Regnaut, S', 'Sanz, C', 'Stokes, E', 'Tondossama, A', 'Tranquilli, S', 'Sunderland-Groves, J', 'Walsh, P', 'Warren, Y', 'Williamson, EA', 'Kuehl, HS']",DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,10.1111/ddi.12005,NOV 2012,45,"Aim To predict the distribution of suitable environmental conditions (SEC) for eight African great ape taxa for a first time period, the 1990s and then project it to a second time period, the 2000s; to assess the relative importance of factors influencing SEC distribution and to estimate rates of SEC loss, isolation and fragmentation over the last two decades. Location Twenty-two African great ape range countries. Methods We extracted 15,051 presence localities collected between 1995 and 2010 from 68 different areas surveyed across the African ape range. We combined a maximum entropy algorithm and logistic regression to relate ape presence information to environmental and human impact variables from the 1990s with a resolution of 5 x 5 km across the entire ape range. We then made SEC projections for the 2000s using updated human impact variables. Results Total SEC area was approximately 2,015,480 and 1,807,653 km2 in the 1990s and 2000s, respectively. Loss of predicted SEC appeared highest for Cross River gorillas (-59%), followed by eastern gorillas (-52%), western gorillas (-32%), bonobos (-29%), central chimpanzees (-17%) and western chimpanzees (-11%). SEC for Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees and eastern chimpanzees was not greatly reduced. Except for Cross River and eastern gorillas, the number of SEC patches did not change significantly, suggesting that SEC loss was caused mainly by patch size reduction. Main conclusions The first continent-wide perspective of African ape SEC distribution shows dramatic declines in recent years. The model has clear limitations for use at small geographic scales, given the quality of available data and the coarse resolution of predictions. However, at the large scale it has potential for informing international policymaking, mitigation of resource extraction and infrastructure development, as well as for spatial prioritization of conservation effort and evaluating conservation effectiveness."
3D geometric morphometric analysis of the proximal epiphysis of the hominoid humerus,"['Arias-Martorell, J', 'Potau, JM', 'Bello-Hellegouarch, G', 'Pastor, JF', 'Perez-Perez, A', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2012.01560.x,NOV 2012,8,"In this study we perform a three-dimensional geometric morphometric (3D GM) analysis of the proximal epiphysis of the humerus in extant great apes, including humans, in order to accurately describe the functional anatomical differences between these taxa. In addition, a fossil hominin specimen of Australopithecus afarensis was included in a multivariate GM analysis in order to test the potential of this methodological approach for making locomotor inferences from fossil remains. The results obtained show significant differences in proximal humeral morphology among the taxa studied, which had thus far largely remained unnoticed. Based on morphofunctional considerations, these anatomical differences can be correlated to differences in the locomotor repertoires of the taxa, thus confirming that the proximal humerus is suitable for constructing paleobiological inferences about locomotion. Modern humans display markedly divergent features, which set them apart from both the extant great apes and the fossil hominin A. afarensis. The morphology of the proximal epiphysis of the humerus of the latter more closely resembles that of the orangutans, thus suggesting that despite hindlimb adaptations to bipedalism, the forelimb of this taxon was still functionally involved in arboreal behaviors, such as climbing or suspension."
Brown Lemurs (Eulemur fulvus) Can Master the Qualitative Version of the Reverse-Reward Contingency,"['Glady, Y', 'Genty, E', 'Roeder, JJ']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0048378,OCT 31 2012,2,Behavioral flexibility that requires behavioral inhibition has important fitness consequences. One task commonly used to assess behavioral inhibition is the reverse-reward task in which the subject is rewarded by the non selected items. Lemurs were tested for their ability to solve the qualitative version of the reverse-reward task with the choice between identical quantities of different food items instead of different quantities of the same food. Two of four subjects mastered the task without a correction procedure and were able to generalize the acquired rule to novel combinations of food. One of the two subjects competent on the quality version of the task could transfer this ability to different quantities of the same food. Our results are compared to lemurs' performances when tested under the quantitative version in a previous study and those of capuchin monkeys tested under a similar paradigm. The whole results suggest that the qualitative version of the reverse-reward task may be easier to master than its quantitative counterpart and that lemurs perform better than capuchin monkeys as they were able to later transfer the learning rule to the quantitative version of the task.
Are there geniuses among the apes?,"['Herrmann, E', 'Call, J']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2012.0191,OCT 5 2012,18,"We are often asked whether some apes are smarter than others. Here we used two individual-based datasets on cognitive abilities to answer this question and to elucidate the structure of individual differences. We identified some individuals who consistently scored well across multiple tasks, and even one individual who could be classified as exceptional when compared with her conspecifics. However, we found no general intelligence factor. Instead, we detected some clusters of certain abilities, including inferences, learning and perhaps a tool-use and quantities cluster. Thus, apes in general and chimpanzees in particular present a pattern characterized by the existence of some smart animals but no evidence of a general intelligence factor. This conclusion contrasts with previous studies that have found evidence of a g factor in primates. However, those studies have used group-based as opposed to the individual-based data used here, which means that the two sets of analyses are not directly comparable. We advocate an approach based on testing multiple individuals (of multiple species) on multiple tasks that capture cognitive, motivational and temperament factors affecting performance. One of the advantages of this approach is that it may contribute to reconcile the general and domain-specific views on primate intelligence."
Evaluation of different storage methods to characterize the fecal bacterial communities of captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Vlckova, K', 'Mrazek, J', 'Kopecny, J', 'Petrzelkova, KJ']",JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS,10.1016/j.mimet.2012.07.015,OCT 2012,10,"Freezing is considered to be the best method for long-term storage of bacterial DNA from feces; however this method cannot be usually applied for samples of wild primates collected in the challenging conditions of the tropical forest. In order to find an alternative conservation method of fecal samples from wild great apes, we compared freezing with other fixation methods. Fecal samples from 11 captive gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from three Czech Zoos were stored using freezing, RNA Stabilization Reagent (RNAlater), and 96% ethanol. Subsequently, the samples were examined using culture-independent methods (PCR-DGGE, and Real-time PCR) to qualitatively and quantitatively assess fecal microbiota composition and to compare differences among the storage methods. Noticeably, freezing samples resulted in the highest recoveries of DNA. No significant differences in DNA recovery were found between freezing and using RNAlater; however, significantly lower DNA concentrations were recovered from samples stored in 96% ethanol. Using PCR-DGGE we found that either 96% ethanol, RNAlater or freezing were suitable for preserving bacterial DNA; however fingerprints obtained from RNAlater storage were more similar to those obtained from the frozen method; in comparison to the patterns resulting from storing samples in ethanol. Using qPCR, frozen samples yielded the highest values of bacterial counts, with the exception of Enterobacteriaceae, which showed the highest numbers using samples stored in ethanol. Sequences of amplicons obtained from PCR-DGGE belonged to the families Clostridiaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae, phylum Firmicutes: however most amplicons showed sequence similarity to previously uncultured microorganisms. Bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes were the most frequently identified species in the fecal bacterial communities of captive western gorillas. The study showed that RNAlater is an optimal storage method when freezing is not possible. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
MAXIMIZING NONHUMAN PRIMATE FECAL SAMPLING IN THE REPUBLIC OF CONGO,"['Olson, SH', 'Cameron, K', 'Reed, P', 'Ondzie, A', 'Joly, D']",JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES,10.7589/2011-11-341,OCT 2012,0,"Techniques for detection of pathogens in wildlife feces allow disease surveillance of species that are difficult to locate and capture (e.g., great apes). However, optimal strategies for detection of feces in logistically challenging environments, such as the forests of Central Africa, have not been developed. We modeled fecal gorilla sampling in the Republic of Congo with computer simulations to explore the performance of different fecal sampling designs in large tropical landscapes. We simulated directed reconnaissance walk (recce) and line-transect distance-sampling survey designs and combinations thereof to maximize the number of fecal samples collected, while also estimating relative ape density on a virtual landscape. We analyzed the performance of different sampling designs across different densities and distributions of ape populations, assessing each for accuracy as well as cost and time efficiencies. Past ape density surveys and fecal deposition rates were used to parameterize the simulated fecal sampling designs. Our results showed that a mixed sampling design that combines traditional transect and a directed reconnaissance sampling design maximized the number of fecal samples collected and estimates of species density. Targeted sampling produced strongly biased estimates of population abundance but maximized efficiency. This research will help design the fecal sampling component of a larger study relating great ape density to Ebola fecal antibody prevalence."
Maximum Likelihood Implementation of an Isolation-with-Migration Model with Three Species for Testing Speciation with Gene Flow,"['Zhu, TQ', 'Yang, ZH']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/mss118,OCT 2012,11,"We implement an isolation with migration model for three species, with migration occurring between two closely related species while an out-group species is used to provide further information concerning gene trees and model parameters. The model is implemented in the likelihood framework for analyzing multilocus genomic sequence alignments, with one sequence sampled from each of the three species. The prior distribution of gene tree topology and branch lengths at every locus is calculated using a Markov chain characterization of the genealogical process of coalescent and migration, which integrates over the histories of migration events analytically. The likelihood function is calculated by integrating over branch lengths in the gene trees (coalescent times) numerically. We analyze the model to study the gene tree-species tree mismatch probability and the time to the most recent common ancestor at a locus. The model is used to construct a likelihood ratio test (LRT) of speciation with gene flow. We conduct computer simulations to evaluate the LRT and found that the test is in general conservative, with the false positive rate well below the significance level. For the test to have substantial power, hundreds of loci are needed. Application of the test to a human-chimpanzee-gorilla genomic data set suggests gene flow around the time of speciation of the human and the chimpanzee."
"Concept formation in American black bears, Ursus americanus","['Vonk, J', 'Jett, SE', 'Mosteller, KW']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.07.020,OCT 2012,9,"Despite their large relative brain size, bears have been neglected in studies of comparative cognition in comparison to their fellow carnivores, the social canines and pinnipeds. Here, three captive adult American black bears were presented with a series of natural concept discrimination tasks on a touchscreen computer, in which the discriminations varied in degree of abstraction. The more abstract discriminations could not be performed by attending to perceptual features of the stimuli alone. For instance, at the most abstract level, the bears were required to select images of animals rather than nonanimals, and exemplars within both categories were perceptually diverse. At least one bear performed at above-chance levels with transfer to novel images at each level of abstraction. The bear that began testing with the most abstract problems showed the best transfer on more abstract discriminations, suggesting that the usual practice of overtraining animals on perceptual discriminations may hinder their ability to acquire concepts at more abstract levels. The bears' performance suggests that a generalized diet may be more critical than group living with regard to the evolution of complex cognition in carnivores.

The effect of domestication and ontogeny in swine cognition (Sus scrofa scrofa and S. s. domestica),"['Albiach-Serrano, A', 'Brauer, J', 'Cacchione, T', 'Zickert, N', 'Amici, F']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2012.07.005,OCT 2012,13,"Domesticated animals show physical, behavioural and cognitive differences from their closest wild relatives. This may have resulted from the former's long and continued selection by humans throughout history, but in some cases it could just reflect developmental differences between wild and domestic animals, given that their environments usually differ significantly. In order to investigate possible effects of domestication and ontogeny on swine cognition, we tested wild boars and two groups of domestic pigs living in more and less enriched conditions. In an object choice paradigm subjects had to find food hidden in one of two containers. They received either a physical cue (i.e., the slope of the board hiding the food, the presence or absence of noise from a shaken container, the sight of a baited container changing position) or a human social cue (i.e., touching, pointing, gazing). According to the domestication hypothesis, given similar rearing conditions domestic pigs should perform better than wild boars when receiving social cues but worse when receiving physical cues. According to the developmental hypothesis, more experienced swine should perform better than less experienced swine both in the physical and in the social domain. Subjects performed better when provided with cues on which they had received adequate experience from their environment, thus providing support to the developmental hypothesis. We conclude by suggesting that specific experience on particular stimuli rather than general experience on a wider range of stimuli may explain swine ability to solve both social and physical tasks.

Regurgitation and reingestion in bonobos (Pan paniscus): Relationships between abnormal and social behavior,"['Miller, LJ', 'Tobey, JR']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2012.07.011,OCT 2012,1,"Regurgitation and reingestion (R/R) is an abnormal behavior observed in great apes analogous to rumination syndrome in humans. A majority of the research on R/R in non-human primates has focused on gorillas and chimpanzees with little information relating to other species that also engage in this behavior. In addition, studies on R/R in non-human primates have primarily focused on diet with little information on other potential causes for this abnormal behavior. The purpose of the current study was to examine R/R in 14 bonobos (Pan paniscus) at two zoological institutions. This included examining the relationships between R/R and other bonobo behaviors as well as the effect of a change in social groupings on RJR. On average, bonobos engaged in R/R about 3.07% of the time and there were no significant differences found in relation to sex (P = 0.190), rearing history (P = 0.414) or age (r(s) = 0.254, P = 0.381). There was a positive correlation between R/R and aggressive behavior (r(s) = 0.579, P < 0.05) at one facility and negative correlation between R/R and affiliative behavior (r(s) = 0.643, P < 0.05) at the other facility. In addition, R/R significantly reduced (r(s) = 0.895, P < 0.01) for one group over time after removing two individuals from that group while holding all other factors constant. These results suggest that that R/R in bonobos could be related to social behavior. At this time, it is unclear if this is a causal relationship or merely a byproduct of two different relationships potentially correlating with stress. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Methods Records of non-human primates that underwent phacoemulsification by the Ophthalmology Services of FHCV-UAB and HCV-UM, between 2003 and 2009 were reviewed. Results Five primates were represented: one gorilla, one chimpanzee, one pygmy marmoset, one orangutan, and one chacma baboon. Three were males and two females, of a median age of 16.8 years. Four primates presented bilateral cataracts and one unilateral (n = 9 eyes). Cataracts were immature in two eyes, mature in four and hypermature in 3. One-handed phacoemulsification was used in seven eyes and a two-handed technique in 2. Intraocular lenses (IOLs), with optic powers between +19.0 and +21.5D, were implanted in the four large-sized primates. All the primates were more active and social after the surgery. Conclusion Phacoemulsification in non-human primates is highly successful and associated with an overall good visual outcome. Nevertheless, specific considerations should be applied in these species."

Chimpanzees in east Africa (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) are also infected with SIVcpz; however, their viruses (SIVcpzPts) have never been found in humans. To examine whether this is due to a paucity of natural infections, we used noninvasive methods to screen wild-living eastern chimpanzees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Uganda, and Rwanda. We also screened bonobos (Pan paniscus) in the DRC, a species not previously tested for SIV in the wild. Fecal samples (n = 3,108) were collected at 50 field sites, tested for species and subspecies origin, and screened for SIVcpz antibodies and nucleic acids. Of 2,565 samples from eastern chimpanzees, 323 were antibody positive and 92 contained viral RNA. The antibody-positive samples represented 76 individuals from 19 field sites, all sampled north of the Congo River in an area spanning 250,000 km(2). In this region, SIVcpzPts was common and widespread, with seven field sites exhibiting infection rates of 30% or greater. The overall prevalence of SIVcpzPts infection was 13.4% (95% confidence interval, 10.7% to 16.5%). In contrast, none of the 543 bonobo samples from six sites was antibody positive. All newly identified SIVcpzPts strains clustered in strict accordance to their subspecies origin; however, they exhibited considerable genetic diversity, especially in protein domains known to be under strong host selection pressure. Thus, the absence of SIVcpzPts zoonoses cannot be explained by an insufficient primate reservoir. Instead, greater adaptive hurdles may have prevented the successful colonization of humans by P. t. schweinfurthii viruses."
"The AL 333-160 fourth metatarsal from Hadar compared to that of humans, great apes, baboons and proboscis monkeys: Non-conclusive evidence for pedal arches or obligate bipedality in Hadar hominins","['Mitchell, PJ', 'Sarmiento, EE', 'Meldrum, DJ', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jchb.2012.08.001,2012,3,"Based on comparisons to non-statistically representative samples of humans and two great ape species (i.e. common chimpanzees Pan troglodytes and lowland gorillas Gorilla gorilla), Ward et al. (2011) concluded that a complete hominin fourth metatarsal (4th MT) from Hadar, AL 333-160, belonged to a committed terrestrial biped with fixed transverse and longitudinal pedal arches, which was no longer under selection favoring substantial arboreal behaviors. According to Ward et al., the Hadar 4th MT had (1) a torsion value indicating a transverse arch, (2) sagittal plane angles between the diaphyseal long axis and the planes of the articular surfaces indicating a longitudinal arch, and (3) a narrow mediolateral to dorsoplantar base ratio, an ectocuneiform facet, and tarsal articular surface contours all indicating a rigid foot without an ape-like mid-tarsal break. Comparisons of the Hadar 4th MT characters to those of statistically representative samples of humans, all five great ape species, baboons and proboscis monkeys show that none of the correlations Ward et al. make to localized foot function were supported by this analysis. The Hadar 4th MT characters are common to catarrhines that have a midtarsal break and lack fixed transverse or longitudinal arches. Further comparison of the AL 333-160 4th MT length, and base, midshaft and head circumferences to those of catarrhines with field collected body weights show that this bone is uniquely short with a large base. Its length suggests the AL 333-160 individual was a poor leaper with limited arboreal behaviors and lacked a longitudinal arch. i.e. its 4th MT long axis was usually held perpendicular to gravity. Its large base implies cuboid-4th MT joint mobility. A relatively short 4th MT head circumference indicates AL 333-160 had small proximal phalanges with a restricted range of mobility. Overall. AL 333-160 is most similar to the 4th MT of eastern gorillas. a slow moving quadruped that sacrifices arboreal behaviors for terrestrial ones. This study highlights evolutionary misconceptions underlying the practice of using localized anatomy and/or a single bony element to reconstruct overall locomotor behaviors and of summarizing great ape structure and behavior based on non-statistically representative samples of only a few living great ape species.

Here we use an alternative approach to genetic inference of species split times in recent human and ape evolution that is independent of the fossil record. We first use genetic parentage information on a large number of wild chimpanzees and mountain gorillas to directly infer their average generation times. We then compare these generation time estimates with those of humans and apply recent estimates of the human mutation rate per generation to derive estimates of split times of great apes and humans that are independent of fossil calibration. We date the human-chimpanzee split to at least 7-8 million years and the population split between Neanderthals and modern humans to 400,000-800,000 y ago.

The hypothesis holds that antagonistic selection for a large neonatal brain and a narrow, bipedal-adapted birth canal poses a problem for childbirth; the hominin ""solution"" is to truncate gestation, resulting in an altricial neonate. This explanation for human altriciality based on pelvic constraints persists despite data linking human life history to that of other species. Here, we present evidence that challenges the importance of pelvic morphology and mechanics in the evolution of human gestation and altriciality. Instead, our analyses suggest that limits to maternal metabolism are the primary constraints on human gestation length and fetal growth. Although pelvic remodeling and encephalization during hominin evolution contributed to the present parturitional difficulty, there is little evidence that pelvic constraints have altered the timing of birth."
Looking anew at cognitive dysfunction in multiple sclerosis The gorilla in the room,"['Feinstein, A', 'Lapshin, H', ""O'Connor, P""]",NEUROLOGY,10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182698da3,SEP 2012,3,"Objective: Inattentional blindness refers to a phenomenon in which individuals fail to notice an object in plain sight. Present in healthy, cognitively intact individuals, it has not been studied in patients with MS in whom it could theoretically act as a marker for real-world cognitive difficulties in those deemed cognitively intact on conventional neuropsychological batteries. Our hypothesis was that difficulty sustaining attention in patients with MS would paradoxically be associated with less inattentional blindness.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken in which a consecutive sample of 68 patients with MS completed neuropsychological testing with the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in Multiple Sclerosis (MACFIMS) battery. Two additional tests were administered, the Stroop Test and a measure of inattentional blindness, i.e., the gorilla in the room paradigm. The gorilla test elicited 2 variables: the ability to detect the gorilla and the number of times a ball was passed between members of one team.

Results: Cognitive dysfunction by MACFIMS criteria was present in 36.8% of subjects. There were no differences between patients with MS and healthy control subjects on the gorilla indices. Similarly, no inattentional differences were present between cognitively intact and impaired patients with MS. However, patients with MS who were impaired on the Stroop and 2-second Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were more likely than their intact counterparts to detect the gorilla (p = 0.038 and 0.014, respectively), with Stroop-impaired patients detecting fewer ball passes (p = 0.002).

Conclusions: The results support our hypothesis that less inattentional blindness is associated with heightened distractibility. This may explain why some patients with MS deemed cognitively intact on a battery of tests such as the MACFIMS still struggle with real-world challenges such as multitasking and filtering distracting stimuli.

Solution of Revecz-Krushinskii test by animals of different taxonomic groups,"['Pleskacheva, MG', 'Zorina, ZA']",JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,10.1134/S002209301205009X,SEP 2012,0,"There has been compared behavior of rats, corvid birds, and monkeys of different species at their performance of the Revecz-Krushinskii test (RKT) developed by L.V. Krushinskii to estimate the human capability for revealing rule of discrete translocation of hidden target object. RKT was introduced as an addition to the test for extrapolation of the movement direction of the lure seen only at the initial pathway fragment; this test is close to Piaget's test (stage 6) evaluating the capability for mental representation and location of the moving hidden object. During RKT, the lure, hidden from animals, was placed, near where it was previous time: at the first test presentation-under the 1st cylinder, at the 2nd one-under the 2nd cylinder, etc. The animals were tested once. It was shown that they did not catch the necessary for successful solution rule of the lure translocation, direction and step of its translocation at each presentation. Only some of the animals solved RKT, found the lure 3 and more times in succession with no errors or with one error. Nevertheless, in all groups the number of errors was lower than that in the model situation of random search. Such optimization was a consequence of universal for all groups' strategy of search in the places where the lure was found recently. With the similar number of errors, rats, birds, and monkeys performed the search differently. Rats were looking for lure mainly among the cylinders where they had found it previously, whereas monkeys and birds the first the new cylinders located near the target one, which implies the existence, to the weak extent, of elements of prognosis. For all groups of animals, RKT turned out to be more difficult both of the test for extrapolation and of the Piaget's test."
Gorillas we have missed: Sustained inattentional deafness for dynamic events,"['Dalton, P', 'Fraenkel, N']",COGNITION,10.1016/j.cognition.2012.05.012,SEP 2012,9,"It is now well-known that the absence of attention can leave us 'blind' to visual stimuli that are very obvious under normal viewing conditions (e.g. a person dressed as a gorilla; Simons & Chabris, 1999). However, the question of whether hearing can ever be susceptible to such effects remains open. Here, we present evidence that the absence of attention can leave people 'deaf' to the presence of an 'auditory gorilla' which is audible for 19s and clearly noticeable under full attention. These findings provide the first ever demonstration of sustained inattentional deafness. The effect is all the more surprising because it occurs within a lifelike, three-dimensional auditory scene in which the unnoticed stimulus moves through the middle of several other dynamic auditory stimuli.

Visitor Effects on the Behavior of Captive Western Lowland Gorillas: The Importance of Individual Differences in Examining Welfare,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Jaicks, HF', 'Drayton, LA']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20425,SEP-OCT 2012,6,"Given the conflicting and somewhat limited findings available on the effect of zoo visitors on primate behavior, the primary purpose of this study was to provide additional data on gorillas' response to variations in crowd size and to look at what other factorsboth intrinsic (e.g. personality, sex, and rearing history) and extrinsic (e.g. group)might influence such responses. Subjects included four groups (three mixed-sex and one bachelor) of captive western lowland gorillas living at Zoo Atlanta. Overall activity budgets and rates of social behaviors in high and low crowd conditions were compared. Behaviors suggestive of general welfare did not vary as a function of crowd size alone, although we did observe one significant interaction and several trends. Specifically, two groups spent more time engaged in undesirable behaviors in the high crowd condition, whereas the other two groups showed the opposite response pattern. Additionally, males, but not females, showed a trend toward greater rates of contact aggression in the high crowd condition, although wounding rates did not vary with crowd size. We also found trends towards variation in response to crowd size as a function of individual personality ratings. These results suggest that although the visitor effect may constitute an impediment to optimal animal welfare, this may only apply to some individuals or groups. We emphasize the importance of continuing to explore individual differences and the limitations of a one-size-fits-all approach when describing influences on animal welfare.

Prevalence of Regurgitation and Reingestion in Orangutans Housed in North American Zoos and an Examination of Factors Influencing its Occurrence in a Single Group of Bornean Orangutans,"['Cassella, CM', 'Mills, A', 'Lukas, KE']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21000,SEP-OCT 2012,0,"Very little research has explored regurgitation and reingestion (R/R) in orangutans. We first aimed to determine the prevalence of R/R in the North American zoo population through a survey of accredited institutions. We report the prevalence of R/R in orangutans >4 years of age as 35% with some sex and species differences. Additionally, survey respondents reported fruit and sweet foods as the most common triggers of R/R. We also explored rates of R/R in a single group of Bornean orangutans at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. We examined the relationship between R/R and feeding schedule and opportunistically observed rates of R/R with and without the presence of browse and sweet foods. We found evidence that R/R is associated with feeding time and that the presence of browse significantly increased the amount of time that animals spent feeding. There was a trend toward decreased R/R when browse was available. We also observed higher rates of R/R when sweet foods were available and we propose that this may have mitigated some of the beneficial effects of browse. We suggest that future studies look further at nutritional influences on R/R behavior. Zoo Biol. 31:609-620, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Noninvasive Follow-Up of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Infection in Wild-Living Nonhabituated Western Lowland Gorillas in Cameroon,"['Etienne, L', 'Locatelli, S', 'Ayouba, A', 'Esteban, A', 'Butel, C', 'Liegeois, F', 'Aghokeng, A', 'Delaporte, E', 'Ngole, EM', 'Peeters, M']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.01186-12,SEP 2012,13,"Simian immunodeficiency viruses infecting western lowland gorillas (SIVgor) are closely related to HIV-1 and are most likely the ancestors of HIV-1 groups 0 and P. At present, limited data are available on genetic diversity, transmission, viral evolution, and pathogenicity of SIVgor in its natural host. Between 2004 and 2011, 961 putative gorilla fecal samples were collected at the Campo Ma'an National Park, Cameroon. Among them, 16% cross-reacted with HIV-1 antibodies, corresponding to at least 34 infected gorillas. Combining host genotyping and field data, we identified four social groups composed of 7 to 15 individuals each, with Sly rates ranging from 13% to 29%. Eleven SIVgor-infected gorillas were sampled multiple times; two most likely seroconverted during the study period, showing that SIVgor continues to spread. Phylogenetic analysis of partial env and pol sequences revealed cocirculation of closely related and divergent strains among gorillas from the same social group, indicating SIVgor transmissions within and between groups. Parental links could be inferred for some gorillas infected with closely related strains, suggesting vertical transmission, but horizontal transmission by sexual or aggressive behavior was also suspected. Intra-host molecular evolution in one gorilla over a 5-year period showed viral adaptations characteristic of escape mutants, i.e., V1V2 loop elongation and an increased number of glycosylation sites. Here we show for the first time the feasibility of noninvasive monitoring of nonhabituated gorillas to study SIVgor infection over time at both the individual and population levels. This approach can also be applied more generally to study other pathogens in wildlife."
"A comparative study of the trabecular bony architecture of the talus in humans, non-human primates, and Australopithecus","['DeSilva, JM', 'Devlin, MJ']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.06.006,SEP 2012,16,"This study tested the hypothesis that talar trabecular microarchitecture reflects the loading patterns in the primate ankle joint, to determine whether talar trabecular morphology might be useful for inferring locomotor behavior in fossil hominins. Trabecular microarchitecture was quantified in the anteromedial, anterolateral, posteromedial, and posterolateral quadrants of the talar body in humans and non-human primates using micro-computed tomography. Trabecular bone parameters, including bone volume fraction, trabecular number and thickness, and degree of anisotropy differed between primates, but not in a manner entirely consistent with hypotheses derived from locomotor kinematics. Humans have highly organized trabecular struts across the entirety of the talus, consistent with the compressive loads incurred during bipedal walking. Chimpanzees possess a high bone volume fraction, consisting of plate-like trabecular struts. Orangutan tali are filled with a high number of thin, connected trabeculae, particularly in the anterior portion of the talus. Gorillas and baboons have strikingly similar internal architecture of the talus. Intraspecific analyses revealed no regional differences in trabecular architecture unique to bipedal humans. Of the 22 statistically significant regional differences in the human talus, all can also be found in other primates. Trabecular thickness, number, spacing, and connectivity density had the same regional relationship in the talus of humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and baboons, suggesting a deeply conserved architecture in the primate talus. Australopithecus tali are human-like in most respects, differing most notably in having more oriented struts in the posteromedial quadrant of the body compared with the posterolateral quadrant. Though this result could mean that australopiths loaded their ankles in a unique manner during bipedal gait, the regional variation in degree of anisotropy was similar in humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. These results collectively suggest that the microarchitecture of the talus does not simply reflect the loading environment, limiting its utility in reconstructing locomotion in fossil primates.

The dietary proclivities of this taxon have implications for reconstructing the paleoecology of the Upper Siwaliks. The dental microwear texture properties of Procynocephalus are compared to those from extant tropical forest primates including Alouatta palliata (n = 11), Cebus apella (n = 13), Gorilla gorilla (n = 9), Lophocebus albigena (n = 15) and Trachypithecus cristatus (n = 12). Dental microwear textures are generated by scanning the surface enamel of Facet 9 using white-light confocal microscopy at 100x. Four variables were extracted from scale-sensitive fractal analysis, and the data were ranked before ANOVA with post-hoc tests of significance and multivariate analyses were performed. Procynocephalus clusters closest to Lophocebus, Cebus and some Gorilla specimens suggesting hard-object feeding characterized a portion of its diet. The dental microwear texture of Procynocephalus supports interpretations of widespread grasslands of the Late Pliocene Kansal Formation (Pinjor zone). The extreme enamel complexity characterizing Procynocephalus may derive from consumption of underground storage organs, or other foods with high grit loads. Foods consumed near ground level carry a heavy load of abrasive minerals possibly contributing to greater enamel surface complexity and textural fill volume."
"Problem solving in great apes (Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and Pongo abelii): the effect of visual feedback","['Volter, CJ', 'Call, J', 'CAUSAL']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-012-0519-5,SEP 2012,10,"What kind of information animals use when solving problems is a controversial topic. Previous research suggests that, in some situations, great apes prefer to use causally relevant cues over arbitrary ones. To further examine to what extent great apes are able to use information about causal relations, we presented three different puzzle box problems to the four nonhuman great ape species. Of primary interest here was a comparison between one group of apes that received visual access to the functional mechanisms of the puzzle boxes and one group that did not. Apes' performance in the first two, less complex puzzle boxes revealed that they are able to solve such problems by means of trial-and-error learning, requiring no information about the causal structure of the problem. However, visual inspection of the functional mechanisms of the puzzle boxes reduced the amount of time needed to solve the problems. In the case of the most complex problem, which required the use of a crank, visual feedback about what happened when the handle of the crank was turned was necessary for the apes to solve the task. Once the solution was acquired, however, visual feedback was no longer required. We conclude that visual feedback about the consequences of their actions helps great apes to solve complex problems. As the crank task matches the basic requirements of vertical string pulling in birds, the present results are discussed in light of recent findings with corvids."

These structures look similar, by chromosome C-banding, to chromosome-end heterochromatin found in chimpanzee, bonobo and gorilla (African great apes), of which a major component is tandem repeats of 32,bp-long, AT-rich units. In the present study, we identified repetitive sequences that are a major component of the siamang heterochromatin. Their repeat units are 171 bp in length, and exhibit sequence similarity to alpha satellite DNA, a major component of the centromeres in primates. Thus, the large-scale heterochromatic structures have different origins between the great apes and the small ape. The presence of alpha satellite DNA in the telomere region has previously been reported in the white-cheeked gibbon Nomascus leucogenys, another small ape species. There is, however, a difference in the size of the telomere-region alpha satellite DNA, which is far larger in the siamang. It is not known whether the sequences of these two species (of different genera) have a common origin because the phylogenetic relationship of genera within the small ape family is still not clear.

Habitats in the northern Lac Tumba Landscape where this study was conducted are mostly swamp and flooded forests, which types have been overlooked in many great ape surveys. This study describes and discusses patterns of bonobo and chimpanzee nesting sites across these habitat types in the general scope of habitat use by great apes. Considerable efforts were deployed to survey forests of the Ngiri Triangle (186 km), Bomongo-Lubengo (126 km) and Bolombo-Losombo (112 km). Great ape nesting site encounter rates (r) were calculated for Bonobos (r = 0.21 nesting sites km-1; Bolombo-Losombo), chimpanzees (r = 0.11 nesting sites km-1; Ngiri Triangle) and (r = 0.02 nesting sites km-1; Bomongo-Lubengo). Swamps and flooded forests dominated the three zones. Nesting sites were at the highest encounter rates in flooded forests; both great ape species were significantly associated with swampy and flood forests. Human signs did not influence the occurrence of nesting sites in these forests. These results confirm findings from other sites where great apes were observed using swamps; they suggest that future surveys include these types of habitat to avoid under-estimating population sizes."

Infant-Directed Communication in Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla): Do Older Animals Scaffold Communicative Competence in Infants?,"['Luef, EM', 'Liebal, K']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22039,SEP 2012,2,"Infant-directed speech is a linguistic phenomenon in which adults adapt their language when addressing infants in order to provide them with more salient linguistic information and aid them in language acquisition. Adult-directed language differs from infant-directed language in various aspects, including speech acoustics, syntax, and semantics. The existence of a gestural motherese in interaction with infants, demonstrates that not only spoken language but also nonvocal modes of communication can become adapted when infants are recipients. Rhesus macaques are so far the only nonhuman primates where a similar phenomenon to motherese has been discovered: the acoustic spectrum of a particular vocalization of adult females may be altered when the addressees are infants. The present paper describes how gorillas adjust their communicative strategies when directing intentional, nonvocal play signals at infants in the sense of a nonvocal motherese. Animals of ages above infancy use a higher rate of repetitions and sequences of the tactile sensory modality when negotiating play with infants. This indicates that gorillas employ a strategy of infant-specific communication. Am. J. Primatol. 74:841-852, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Much of the debate in this research has focused on whether subjects simply use certain stimulus features or instead use more functionally relevant information regarding the effect that certain features may have on a moving reward. Here, we presented two obstacle tasks, a trap platform and a barrier platform, to 22 great apes. Although perceptually similar, these two tasks contain two perceptually different but functionally equivalent obstacles: a trap and a barrier. In a pre-exposure phase, subjects either experienced an obstacle task or a task without any obstacle. In the transfer phase, all subjects were presented with an obstacle task, either the trap platform or the barrier platform. Our results show that those subjects who received an obstacle task prior to the second task performed better than those who first received a non-obstacle task. The type of obstacle task that subjects received first did not have any effect on their performance in the transfer phase. We suggest that apes possess some knowledge about the effects that obstacles have on slow-moving unsupported objects."

Here, we report on bioclimatic aspects of SP site choice among dry-habitat chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at the Toro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve, Uganda. We placed a portable weather monitor within 1 m of chimpanzee SPs and compared the microenvironment of this site with terrestrial monitors placed 10 cm above the ground directly underneath the simultaneously studied SP. We calculated physical comfort levels of monitored sites using the RayMan thermophysiological model that we modified to take ape body proportions into account. The RayMan tool gauges energy balance using wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, and heat index in conjunction with the study subject's mass and stature to determine whether the individual is in energy balance or homeostasis. We found that (1) terrestrial microclimates have greater homeostatic potential than arboreal microclimates, and (2) there is a significant positive linear relationship between wind speed and height of SP in the forest canopy. Advantages of terrestrial sites are that they require lesser energetic expenditure to stabilize the body when the SP is under construction and perhaps during use as well. We found that terrestrial sites also had better homeostatic potentials. This combination of advantages explains why SPs are so often sited terrestrially in habitats where predation risk is low. Early hominins must have had technological or social measures to avoid or deter predators that were significantly advanced over those found among chimpanzees before they began sleeping on the ground.

However, with few exceptions, our understanding of primate ranging patterns stems from studies of single groups and both intra- and inter-specific meta-analyses. Studies with many groups and those that incorporate whole populations are rare but important for testing socioecological theory in primates. We quantify the ranging patterns of nine chacma baboon troops in a single population and use Spearman rank correlations and generalized linear mixed models to analyze the effects of troop size and human-modified habitat (a proxy for good quality habitat) on home range size, density (individuals/km2), and daily path length. Intrapopulation variation in home range sizes (1.537.7 km2), densities (1.312.1 baboons/km2), and daily path lengths (1.806.61 km) was so vast that values were comparable to those of baboons inhabiting the climatic extremes of their current distribution. Both troop size and human-modified habitat had an effect on ranging patterns. Larger troops had larger home ranges and longer daily path lengths, while troops that spent more time in human-modified habitat had shorter daily path lengths. We found no effect of human-modified habitat on home range size or density. These results held when we controlled for the effects of both a single large outlier troop living exclusively in human-modified habitat and baboon monitors on our spatial variables. Our findings confirm the ability of baboons, as behaviorally adaptable dietary generalists, to not only survive but also to thrive in human-modified habitats with adjustments to their ranging patterns in accordance with current theory. Our findings also caution that studies focused on only a small sample of groups within a population of adaptable and generalist primate species may underestimate the variability in their respective localities.

The Glu27 allele in ADRB2 and the Arg64 allele in ADRB3 are associated with abdominal obesity and early onset of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in many ethnic groups. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) is required for adipocyte differentiation. Pro12Ala mutation decreases PPARG activity and resistance to NIDDM. In humans, energy-expense alleles, Gln27 in ADRB2 and Trp64 in ADRB3, are at higher frequencies than Glu27 and Arg64, respectively, but Ala12 in PPARG is at lower frequency than Pro12. Adaptation of humans for lipolysis, thermogenesis, and reduction of fat accumulation could be considered by examining which alleles in these genes are dominant in non-human primates (NHP). All NHP (P. troglodytes, G. gorilla, P. pygmaeus, H. agilis and macaques) had energy-thrifty alleles, Gly16 and Glu27 in ADRB2, and Arg64 in ADRB3, but did not have energy-expense alleles, Arg16, Gln27 and Trp64 alleles. In PPARG gene, all NHP had large adipocyte accumulating type, the Pro12 allele. Conclusions: These results indicate that a tendency to produce much more heat through the energy-expense alleles developed only in humans, who left tropical rainforests for savanna and developed new features in their heat-regulation systems, such as reduction of body hair and increased evaporation of water, and might have helped the protection of entrails from cold at night, especially in glacial periods."
Primate phylogeny: molecular evidence for a pongid clade excluding humans and a prosimian clade containing tarsiers,"['Huang, S']",SCIENCE CHINA-LIFE SCIENCES,10.1007/s11427-012-4350-7,AUG 2012,1,"Unbiased readings of fossils are well known to contradict some of the popular molecular groupings among primates, particularly with regard to great apes and tarsiers. The molecular methodologies today are however flawed as they are based on a mistaken theoretical interpretation of the genetic equidistance phenomenon that originally started the field. An improved molecular method the 'slow clock' was here developed based on the Maximum Genetic Diversity hypothesis, a more complete account of the unified changes in genotypes and phenotypes. The method makes use of only slow evolving sequences and requires no uncertain assumptions or mathematical corrections and hence is able to give definitive results. The findings indicate that humans are genetically more distant to orangutans than African apes are and separated from the pongid clade similar to 17.6 million years ago. Also, tarsiers are genetically closer to lorises than simian primates are. Finally, the fossil times for the radiation of mammals at the K/T boundary and for the Eutheria-Metatheria split in the Early Cretaceous were independently confirmed from molecular dating calibrated using the fossil split times of gorilla-orangutan, mouse-rat, and opossum-kangaroo. Therefore, the re-established primate phylogeny indicates a remarkable unity between molecules and fossils."
"The Length of the Barrett's Mucosa in Baboons, Revisited","['Rubio, CA', 'Nilsson, JR', 'Owston, M', 'Dick, EJ']",ANTICANCER RESEARCH,NA,AUG 2012,4,"Background: Chewing of regurgitated food with rumination elicits, gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in baboons. Protracted reflux transforms the distal multilayered spumous cell-lined epithelium into columnar-lined mucosa, with mucus-producing glands having interspersed oxyntic glands. In humans, this histological constellation is called Barrett's mucosa type 2 (BMT2). Materials and Methods: The distal esophagus together with the proximal stomach was removed en bloc, at autopsy, from 35 adult baboons. Longitudinal sections were stained with toluidine blue, a stain that permits easy discrimination between parietal and chief gastric glands. Using a calibrated ocular scale, the length of the BMT2 was assessed in all 35 baboons. Results: The mean length of the BMT2 was 9.80 mm (range 1.0 mm-40.2 mm). Conclusion: BMT2 in baboons is an integrated part of the natural phenomenon of mucosal adaptation to daily regurgitation of gastric acid into the distal esophagus (natural GER), whereas BMT2 in humans might reflect an evolutionary atavism in the esophagus, triggered by a non-physiological disorder (pathological GER). The baboon offers a suitable model to monitor the series of histological events that take place in the distal esophagus under the influence of protracted GER."
Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta) Spontaneously Generalize to Novel Quantities in a Reverse-Reward Contingency Task,"['Kralik, JD']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0026019,AUG 2012,1,"The Abstracting generalities from concrete experience allows the application of acquired knowledge to novel situations, a hallmark of primate cognition. Abstraction may also enable some animals to overcome prepotent biases, by allowing them to treat prepotent stimuli and responses more flexibly. The aim of the current study was to determine whether rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) could generalize successful performance on an executive control task with one training exemplar to novel exemplars. Three monkeys learned a reverse-reward task in which they chose between one and four food items. They had to select the smaller quantity to receive the larger one, and so had to inhibit the prepotent selection of the larger quantity. After they learned the task, a transfer test assessed whether they had learned only about the quantities experienced or whether they could generalize to novel quantities. All three rhesus monkeys spontaneously generalized to novel quantities, showing that this species has the ability to generalize significantly beyond the immediate perceptual experience and use this ability to control lower-level, prepotent responses."
Testing the Oxidative Stress Hypothesis of Aging in Primate Fibroblasts: Is There a Correlation Between Species Longevity and Cellular ROS Production?,"['Csiszar, A', 'Podlutsky, A', 'Podlutskaya, N', 'Sonntag, WE', 'Merlin, SZ', 'Philipp, EER', 'Doyle, K', 'Davila, A', 'Recchia, FA', 'Ballabh, P', 'Pinto, JT', 'Ungvari, Z']",JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL SCIENCES,10.1093/gerona/glr216,AUG 2012,27,"The present study was conducted to test predictions of the oxidative stress theory of aging assessing reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress resistance in cultured fibroblasts from 13 primate species ranging in body size from 0.25 to 120 kg and in longevity from 20 to 90 years. We assessed both basal and stress-induced reactive oxygen species production in fibroblasts from five great apes (human, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and orangutan), four Old World monkeys (baboon, rhesus and crested black macaques, and patas monkey), three New World monkeys (common marmoset, red-bellied tamarin, and woolly monkey), and one lemur (ring-tailed lemur). Measurements of cellular MitoSox fluorescence, an indicator of mitochondrial superoxide (O-2(center dot-)) generation, showed an inverse correlation between longevity and steady state or metabolic stress induced mitochondrial O-2(center dot-) production, but this correlation was lost when the effects of body mass were removed, and the data were analyzed using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Fibroblasts from longer-lived primate species also exhibited superior resistance to H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death than cells from shorter-living primates. After correction for body mass and lack of phylogenetic independence, this correlation, although still discernible, fell short of significance by regression analysis. Thus, increased longevity in this sample of primates is not causally associated with low cellular reactive oxygen species generation, but further studies are warranted to test the association between increased cellular resistance to oxidative stressor and primate longevity."
Molecular diversity of entodiniomorphid ciliate Troglodytella abrassarti and its coevolution with chimpanzees,"['Vallo, P', 'Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Profousova, I', 'Petrasova, J', 'Pomajbikova, K', 'Leendertz, F', 'Hashimoto, C', 'Simmons, N', 'Babweteera, F', 'Machanda, Z', 'Piel, A', 'Robbins, MM', 'Boesch, C', 'Sanz, C', 'Morgan, D', 'Sommer, V', 'Furuichi, T', 'Fujita, S', 'Matsuzawa, T', 'Kaur, T', 'Huffman, MA', 'Modry, D']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22067,AUG 2012,1,"The entodiniomorphid ciliate Troglodytella abrassarti is a colonic mutualist of great apes. Its host specificity makes it a suitable model for studies of primate evolution. We explored molecular diversity of T. abrassarti with regard to large geographical distribution and taxonomic diversity of its most common host, the chimpanzee. We found a very low diversification of T. abrassarti in chimpanzees across Africa. Distribution of two types of T. abrassarti supports evolutionary separation of the Western chimpanzee, P. t. verus, from populations in Central and East Africa. Type I T. abrassarti is probably a derived form, which corresponds with the Central African origin of chimpanzees and a founder event leading to P. t. verus. Exclusivity of the respective types of T. abrassarti to Western and Central/Eastern chimpanzees corroborates the difference found between an introduced population of presumed Western chimpanzees on Rubondo Island and an autochthonous population in mainland Tanzania. The identity of T. abrassarti from Nigerian P. t. ellioti and Central African chimpanzees suggests their close evolutionary relationship. Although this contrasts with published mtDNA data, it corroborates current opinion on the exclusive position of P. t. verus within the chimpanzee phylogeny. The type of T. abrassarti occurring in Central and East African common chimpanzee was confirmed also in bonobos. This may point to the presence of an ancestral Type II found throughout the Lower Guinean rainforest dating back to the common Pan ancestor. Alternatively, the molecular uniformity of T. abrassarti may imply a historical overlap of the species' distribution ranges. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Brief communication: Hand preference for bimanual and unimanual feeding in captive gorillas: Extension in a second colony of apes,"['Lambert, M']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22095,AUG 2012,6,"Right-hand dominance is widely considered to be a uniquely human trait. Whether nonhuman primates exhibit similar population-level hand preferences remains a topic of considerable debate. Despite extensive research focusing on laterality in nonhuman primates, our interpretation of these studies is limited due to methodological issues including the lack of a common measure of hand preference and the use of tasks that may not be reliable indicators of handedness. The use of consistent methods between studies is necessary to enable comparisons within and between species and allow for more general conclusions to be drawn from these results. The present study replicates methods used in recent research reporting population-level right-handedness in captive gorillas (Meguerditchian et al.,2010). Observational data were collected on hand preference for unimanual and bimanual feeding in 14 captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Individual-level preferences were found, primarily for bimanual feeding; however, the data reveal no group-level directional bias (contra Meguerditchian et al.). Like the study by Meguerditchian et al. (2010), though, bimanual feeding revealed significantly stronger hand preferences than unimanual reaching, and age, sex, group membership, or rearing history had no effect on hand preference. Finally, variations in diet and corresponding grip type between studies suggest that hand preferences may vary across bimanual tasks depending on grip morphology. This study aims to contribute to our existing knowledge of primate laterality by increasing the number of individuals investigated using methods that allow for comparisons with similar research.

"Hebephilia as Mental Disorder?

(2009) demonstrated that hebephilia is a genuine sexual preference, but then proposed, without argument or evidence, that it should be designated as a mental disorder in the DSM-5. A series of Letters-to-the-Editor criticized this proposal as a non sequitur. Blanchard (2009), in rebuttal, reaffirmed his position, but without adequately addressing some central criticisms. In this article, we examine hebephilia-as-disorder in full detail. Unlike Blanchard et al., we discuss definitions of mental disorder, examine extensive evidence from a broad range of sources, and consider alternative (i.e., non-pathological) explanations for hebephilia. We employed Wakefield's (1992b) harmful dysfunction approach to disorder, which holds that a condition only counts as a disorder when it is a failure of a naturally selected mechanism to function as designed, which is harmful to the individual in the current environment. We also considered a harmful-for-others approach to disorder (Brulde, 2007). Examination of historical, cross-cultural, sociological, cross-species, non-clinical empirical, and evolutionary evidence and perspectives indicated that hebephilic interest is an evolved capacity and hebephilic preference an expectable distributional variant, both of which were adaptively neutral or functional, not dysfunctional, in earlier human environments. Hebephilia's conflict with modern society makes it an evolutionary mismatch, not a genuine disorder. Though it should not be classified as a disorder, it could be entered in the DSM's 5-code section, used for non-disordered conditions that create significant problems in present-day society."

"Understanding the nesting spatial behaviour of gorillas in the Kagwene Sanctuary, Cameroon","['Funwi-Gabga, N', 'Mateu, J']",STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,10.1007/s00477-011-0541-1,AUG 2012,4,"We use spatial point pattern methods to analyse gorilla nest site data, and to enhance our understanding of the nesting behaviour of the Gorilla gorilla diehli in the Kagwene Sanctuary, Cameroon. Data were split into different seasons and different gorilla groups to better understand gorilla nesting behaviour at these different scales. Gorilla nest site distribution was found to be inhomogeneous and clustered, as a result of the inhomogeneity in the distribution of the environmental factors (such as elevation, slope, vegetation and aspect), and because of the interaction between nest sites. The proposed models reflected therefore a combination of the effect of environmental factors and interaction between nest sites. Predictions from these models showed that there is less space available for gorilla nest site location in the dry season than in the rainy season. It also showed that the Minor gorilla group has a bigger niche than the Major group, suggesting a nesting disadvantage in the larger size group. We also found that nest site locations of Major gorilla groups attract Minor groups, and vice versa."
Shared Human-Chimpanzee Pattern of Perinatal Femoral Shaft Morphology and Its Implications for the Evolution of Hominin Locomotor Adaptations,"['Morimoto, N', 'Zollikofer, CPE', 'de Leon, MSP']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0041980,JUL 25 2012,6,"Background: Acquisition of bipedality is a hallmark of human evolution. How bipedality evolved from great ape-like locomotor behaviors, however, is still highly debated. This is mainly because it is difficult to infer locomotor function, and even more so locomotor kinematics, from fossil hominin long bones. Structure-function relationships are complex, as long bone morphology reflects phyletic history, developmental programs, and loading history during an individual's lifetime. Here we discriminate between these factors by investigating the morphology of long bones in fetal and neonate great apes and humans, before the onset of locomotion.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Comparative morphometric analysis of the femoral diaphysis indicates that its morphology reflects phyletic relationships between hominoid taxa to a greater extent than taxon-specific locomotor adaptations. Diaphyseal morphology in humans and chimpanzees exhibits several shared-derived features, despite substantial differences in locomotor adaptations. Orangutan and gorilla morphologies are largely similar, and likely represent the primitive hominoid state.

Conclusions/Significance: These findings are compatible with two possible evolutionary scenarios. Diaphyseal morphology may reflect retained adaptive traits of ancestral taxa, hence human-chimpanzee shared-derived features may be indicative of the locomotor behavior of our last common ancestor. Alternatively, diaphyseal morphology might reflect evolution by genetic drift (neutral evolution) rather than selection, and might thus be more informative about phyletic relationships between taxa than about locomotor adaptations. Both scenarios are consistent with the hypothesis that knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and gorillas resulted from convergent evolution, and that the evolution of human bipedality is unrelated to extant great ape locomotor specializations."

"To Beg, or Not to Beg? That Is the Question: Mangabeys Modify Their Production of Requesting Gestures in Response to Human's Attentional States","['Maille, A', 'Engelhart, L', 'Bourjade, M', 'Blois-Heulin, C']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0041197,JUL 18 2012,11,"Background: Although gestural communication is widespread in primates, few studies focused on the cognitive processes underlying gestures produced by monkeys.

Methodology/Principal Findings: The present study asked whether red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus) trained to produce visually based requesting gestures modify their gestural behavior in response to human's attentional states. The experimenter held a food item and displayed five different attentional states that differed on the basis of body, head and gaze orientation; mangabeys had to request food by extending an arm toward the food item (begging gesture). Mangabeys were sensitive, at least to some extent, to the human's attentional state. They reacted to some postural cues of a human recipient: they gestured more and faster when both the body and the head of the experimenter were oriented toward them than when they were oriented away. However, they did not seem to use gaze cues to recognize an attentive human: monkeys begged at similar levels regardless of the experimenter's eyes state.

Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that mangabeys lowered their production of begging gestures when these could not be perceived by the human who had to respond to it. This finding provides important evidence that acquired begging gestures of monkeys might be used intentionally."
Teasing apart the contributions of hard dietary items on 3D dental microtextures in primates,"['Calandra, I', 'Schulz, E', 'Pinnow, M', 'Krohn, S', 'Kaiser, TM']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.05.001,JUL 2012,18,"3D dental microtexture analysis is a powerful tool for reconstructing the diets of extinct primates. This method is based on the comparison of fossils with extant species of known diet. The diets of primates are highly diversified and include fruits, seeds, grass, tree leaves, bark, roots, tubers, and animal resources. Fruits remain the main component in the diets of most primates. We tested whether the proportion of fruit consumed is correlated with dental microtexture. Two methods of microtexture analysis, the scale-sensitive fractal analysis (SSFA) and the Dental Areal Surface Texture Analysis (DASTA; after ISO/FDIS 25178-2), were applied to specimens of eight primate species (Alouatia seniculus, Gorilla gorilla, Lophocebus albigena, Macaca fascicularis, Pan troglodytes, Papio cynocephalus, Pongo abelii, Theropithecus gelada). These species largely differ in the mean annual proportion of fruit (from 0 to 90%) in their diet, as well as in their consumption of other hard items (seeds, bark, and insect cuticles) and of abrasive plants. We find the complexity and heterogeneity of textures (SSFA) to correlate with the proportion of fruits consumed. Textural fill volume (SSFA) indicates the proportion of both fruits and other hard items processed. Furthermore, anisotropy (SSFA) relates to the consumption of abrasive plants like grass and other monocots. ISO parameters valley height, root mean square height, material volume, density of peaks, and closed hill and dale areas (DASTA) describe the functional interaction between food items and enamel facets during mastication. The shallow, plastic deformation of enamel surfaces induced by small hard particles, such as phytoliths or dust, results in flat microtexture relief, whereas the brittle, deep fracture caused by large hard items such as hard seeds creates larger relief.

Environmental enrichment for a mixed-species nocturnal mammal exhibit,"['Clark, FE', 'Melfi, VA']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20380,JUL-AUG 2012,2,"Environmental enrichment (EE) is an integral aspect of modern zoo animal management but, empirical evaluation of it is biased toward species housed in single-species groups. Nocturnal houses, where several nocturnal species are housed together, are particularly overlooked. This study investigated whether three species (nine-banded armadillos, Dasypus novemcinctus; Senegal bush babies, Galago senegalensis; two-toed sloths, Choloepus didactylus) in the nocturnal house at Paignton Zoo Environmental Park, UK could be enriched using food-based and sensory EE. Subjects were an adult male and female of each species. EE was deemed effective if it promoted target species-typical behaviors, behavioral diversity, and increased use of enriched exhibit zones. Results from generalized linear mixed models demonstrated that food-based EE elicited the most positive behavioral effects across species. One set of food-based EEs (Kong (R), termite mound and hanging food) presented together was associated with a significant increase in species-typical behaviors, increased behavioral diversity, and increased use of enriched exhibit zones in armadillos and bush babies. Although one type of sensory EE (scented pine cones) increased overall exhibit use in all species, the other (rainforest sounds) was linked to a significant decrease in species-typical behavior in bush babies and sloths. There were no intra or interspecies conflicts over EE, and commensalism occurred between armadillos and bush babies. Our data demonstrate that simple food-based and sensory EE can promote positive behavioral changes in a mixed-species nocturnal mammal exhibit. We suggest that both food and sensory EE presented concurrently will maximize opportunities for naturalistic activity in all species. Zoo Biol 31:397413, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

We found a wounded juvenile female Bornean orangutan on 7 October 2006 in the Danum Valley, Sabah, Malaysia, and observed the individual's behavior for 7 days until her death on 13 October 2006. The 5-6-year-old orangutan, which we had observed since 2004, was wounded in the left brachium, back, and right hand. The individual's behavior changed after injury; the mean nest-nest active time became significantly shorter than before injury (from 12 h 3 min to 9 h 33 min), the mean waking time became significantly later (0552-0629 hours) and the mean bedtime became significantly earlier (from 1747 to 1603 hours). In the activity budget, resting increased significantly from 28.0 to 53.3%. Traveling and feeding decreased significantly from 23.5 to 12.7% and from 45.6 to 32.8%, respectively. The rate of brachiation during traveling and nest making decreased, whereas ground activity increased from 0 to 9%. We observed one vomiting incident and four occurrences of watery diarrhea during the 7 days before the individual died. The results of an autopsy performed by a local veterinarian suggested that the cause of death was septicemia because of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of the severely contaminated wounds. The morphology and distribution of the wounds suggested they had been incurred during an attack by a large animal with fangs and/or claws. This juvenile female became independent of its mother at similar to 4-5 years of age, slightly earlier than average. This individual might have been vulnerable to predatory attack because of her small body size (similar to 5 kg at death) and lack of the mother's protection."
Terrestrial nest-building by wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): Implications for the tree-to-ground sleep transition in early hominins,"['Koops, K', 'McGrew, WC', 'Matsuzawa, T', 'Knapp, LA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22056,JUL 2012,9,"Nest-building is a great ape universal and arboreal nesting in chimpanzees and bonobos suggests that the common ancestor of Pan and Homo also nested in trees. It has been proposed that arboreal nest-building remained the prevailing pattern until Homo erectus, a fully terrestrial biped, emerged. We investigated the unusual occurrence of ground-nesting in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), which may inform on factors influencing the tree-to-ground sleep transition in the hominin lineage. We used a novel genetic approach to examine ground-nesting in unhabituated chimpanzees at Seringbara in the Nimba Mountains, Guinea. Previous research showed that ground-nesting at Seringbara was not ecologically determined. Here, we tested a possible mate-guarding function of ground-nesting by analyzing DNA from shed hairs collected from ground nests and tree nests found in close proximity. We examined whether or not ground-nesting was a group-level behavioral pattern and whether or not it occurred in more than one community. We used multiple genetic markers to identify sex and to examine variation in mitochondrial DNA control region (HV1, HV2) sequences. Ground-nesting was a male-biased behavior and males constructed more elaborate (night) nests than simple (day) nests on the ground. The mate-guarding hypothesis was not supported, as ground and associated tree nests were built either by maternally-related males or possibly by the same individuals. Ground-nesting was widespread and likely habitual in two communities. We suggest that terrestrial nest-building may have already occurred in arboreally-adapted early hominins before the emergence of H. erectus. Am J Phys Anthropol 148:351361, 2012.

3D Analysis of the Forearm Rotational Efficiency Variation in Humans,"['Ibanez-Gimeno, P', 'Jordana, X', 'Manyosa, J', 'Malgosa, A', 'Galtes, I', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.22483,JUL 2012,6,"Pronosupination is a component of the hominoid orthograde corporal plane that enables primates to execute efficient and sure locomotion in their habitat and is an essential movement for the development of manipulative capacities. We analyze human variability in the rotational efficiency of the pronator teres muscle by applying the biomechanical model created by Galtes et al. (Am J Phys Anthropol 2008; 135:293-300; Am J Phys Anthropol 2009a; 140:589-594) to skeletal remains of a human sample (N = 29) and three nonhuman hominoid specimens (chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan) by means of 3D technology. We aim to examine whether there is a distinctive human pattern of rotational efficiency and determine which structural features of the upper-limb bones have the greatest influence on the determination of rotational efficiency. Our results show that the human pattern differs from efficiencies observed in nonhuman hominoids, which may be interpreted in the light of morphofunctional adaptations. We identify medial epicondylar form as the key structure of the upper-limb bones for the determination of the rotational efficiency of the forearm. Results indicate that the more medially projected epicondyle of nonhuman hominoids relative to humans leads to higher values of maximum rotational efficiency. Moreover, the orientation of the medial epicondyle determines the pronounced differences in the position of the maximum efficiencies in the pronosupination range between humans and the studied nonhuman hominoids. Proximodistal orientation of the medial epicondyle is suggested to be a more appropriate feature for distinguishing between humans and nonhuman hominoids than anteroposterior orientation and, therefore, for inferring behavioral aspects from skeletal remains and fossils of primate upper-limb bones.

An Ancestral miR-1304 Allele Present in Neanderthals Regulates Genes Involved in Enamel Formation and Could Explain Dental Differences with Modern Humans,"['Lopez-Valenzuela, M', 'Ramirez, O', 'Rosas, A', 'Garcia-Vargas, S', 'de la Rasilla, M', 'Lalueza-Fox, C', 'Espinosa-Parrilla, Y']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/mss023,JUL 2012,9,"Genetic changes in regulatory elements are likely to result in phenotypic effects that might explain population-specific as well as species-specific traits. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are posttranscriptional repressors involved in the control of almost every biological process. These small noncoding RNAs are present in various phylogenetic groups, and a large number of them remain highly conserved at the sequence level. MicroRNA-mediated regulation depends on perfect matching between the seven nucleotides of its seed region and the target sequence usually located at the 3' untranslated region of the regulated gene. Hence, even single changes in seed regions are predicted to be deleterious as they may affect miRNA target specificity. In accordance to this, purifying selection has strongly acted on these regions. Comparison between the genomes of present-day humans from various populations, Neanderthal, and other nonhuman primates showed an miRNA, miR-1304, that carries a polymorphism on its seed region. The ancestral allele is found in Neanderthal, nonhuman primates, at low frequency (similar to 5%) in modern Asian populations and rarely in Africans. Using miRNA target site prediction algorithms, we found that the derived allele increases the number of putative target genes for the derived miRNA more than ten-fold, indicating an important functional evolution for miR-1304. Analysis of the predicted targets for derived miR-1304 indicates an association with behavior and nervous system development and function. Two of the predicted target genes for the ancestral miR-1304 allele are important genes for teeth formation, enamelin, and amelotin. MicroRNA overexpression experiments using a luciferase-based assay showed that the ancestral version of miR-1304 reduces the enamelin- and amelotin-associated reporter gene expression by 50%, whereas the derived miR-1304 does not have any effect. Deletion of the corresponding target sites for miR-1304 in these dental genes avoided their repression, which further supports their regulation by the ancestral miR-1304. Morphological studies described several differences in the dentition of Neanderthals and present-day humans like slower dentition timing and thicker enamel for present-day humans.

We use a combination of line-transect surveys in 2002 and 2009 (N = 540 km) and ethnographic interviews (N = 210) to investigate changes in the status of cerco-pithecines and colobines at RDS, with additional comparisons to earlier work. This protected area was lightly logged in the 1970s and the park was gazetted in 1990, with multiple-use reserve sectors allocated. Since the park's inception, hunting and the trade of primates have increased, along with human migration, greater accessibility of arms, and reduction of preferred ungulate prey. Primates have declined in both the park and reserve sectors. Our data further suggest that at RDS hunting has had a greater impact on primate diversity and abundance than logging. We have identified changes in species-specific vulnerability to hunting over time, with Cercopithecus nictitans and Lophocebus albigena initially having appeared to be relatively resistant to hunting pressure in 2002. However, subsequently as gun hunting has increased at RDS, these species have become vulnerable. Although monkeys at RDS have been responding behaviorally to increased gun hunting, they are not able to keep pace with changing hunting practices. This study allows us to begin to understand synergistic impacts of hunting and logging, necessary if we are to recommend strategies to better secure the future of primates in multiuse protected areas.

The Effect of Low- and High-Fiber Diets on the Population of Entodiniomorphid Ciliates Troglodytella Abrassarti in Captive Chimpanzees (Pan Troglodytes),"['Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Schovancova, K', 'Profousova, I', 'Kisidayova, S', 'Varadyova, Z', 'Pekar, S', 'Kamler, J', 'Modry, D', 'AUSTRALIAN MARSUPIALS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22021,JUL 2012,2,"Troglodytella abrassarti is an intestinal entodiniomorphid ciliate commonly diagnosed in the feces of wild and captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Entodiniomorphids could be considered to have a mutualistic relationship with the great apes, in that the ciliates benefit from the intestinal ecosystem of the host, while also contributing to the fiber fermentation process. We examined the effect of diet on the infection intensities of T. abrassarti in two captive chimpanzees in the Liberec Zoo, Czech Republic. The chimpanzees were fed a low-fiber diet (LFD) with 14% neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and a high-fiber diet (HFD; 26% NDF) for 10 days with one transition, and two 10-day adaptation periods. Fecal samples were examined coproscopically with the merthiolate-iodine-formaldehyde concentration (MIFC) technique, in order to quantify the number of ciliates per gram of feces. A significant trend of increasing T. abrassarti numbers was observed when the animals were fed the LFD, compared to when they were fed the HFD. Our results suggest, however, that infection intensities of T. abrassarti in captive chimpanzees are not influenced primarily by the amount of fiber in the diet, but rather by the dietary starch concentration (HFD: 1%; LFD: 8%).

Bornean orangutans on the brink of protein bankruptcy,"['Vogel, ER', 'Knott, CD', 'Crowley, BE', 'Blakely, MD', 'Larsen, MD', 'Dominy, NJ']",BIOLOGY LETTERS,10.1098/rsbl.2011.1040,JUN 23 2012,13,"Protein is a limiting resource that is essential to the growth, maintenance and reproduction of tropical frugivores, yet few studies have examined how wild animals maintain protein balance. During chronic periods of fruit scarcity, Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) often catabolize their own fat reserves despite unusually low metabolic requirements. Such energy deficits suggest a marginal existence, and raise the possibility that orangutans also endure periods of negative protein balance. To test this hypothesis, we conducted the first study of protein cycling in a wild primate. Our five year analysis of urinary metabolites revealed evidence of protein recycling when fruit was scarce. During these periods, orangutans consumed more leaves and bark, proteinaceous but tough foods that yielded a mean daily intake of 1.4 g protein kg(-1) metabolic mass. Such an amount is inadequate for humans and one-tenth the intake of mountain gorillas, but sufficient to avert, perhaps narrowly, a severe protein deficit. Our findings highlight the functional and adaptive value of traits that maximize protein assimilation during periods of ecological exigency."

Split insertion of the abductor pollicis longus (APL) is commonly found in chimpanzees, gorillas and gibbons. A comparable identical pattern of anomalous slips in humans is of anthropological and phylogenetic importance and could be a result of atavism. This case report describes an unusual fused muscle belly of the APL and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB), which split into three slips - medial, intermediate and lateral. Further, the medial slip was seen to divide into two tendons, inserting on the base of the first metacarpal along with the intermediate slip. The lateral slip divided into three tendons, inserting into the base of the proximal phalanx, base of the first metacarpal and abductor pollicis brevis muscle. The fusion and unusual insertion pattern of the APL and EPB merits documentation for reconstructive procedures such as tendon transfer and interposition arthroplasty."
"No Evidence for Transmission of Antibiotic-Resistant Escherichia coli Strains from Humans to Wild Western Lowland Gorillas in Lope National Park, Gabon","['Benavides, JA', 'Godreuil, S', 'Bodenham, R', 'Ratiarison, S', 'Devos, C', 'Petretto, MO', 'Raymond, M', 'Escobar-Paramo, P']",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,10.1128/AEM.07593-11,JUN 2012,7,"The intensification of human activities within the habitats of wild animals is increasing the risk of interspecies disease transmission. This risk is particularly important for great apes, given their close phylogenetic relationship with humans. Areas of high human density or intense research and ecotourism activities expose apes to a high risk of disease spillover from humans. Is this risk lower in areas of low human density? We determined the prevalence of Escherichia coli antibiotic-resistant isolates in a population of the critically endangered western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and other wild mammals in Lope National Park (LNP), Gabon, and we tested whether the observed pattern could be explained by bacterial transmission from humans and domestic animals into wildlife populations. Our results show a high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial isolates in humans and low levels in gorillas and other wildlife. The significant differences in the genetic background of the resistant bacteria isolated from humans and gorillas suggest that transmission is low or does not occur between these two species. These findings indicate that the presence of antibiotic-resistant strains in wildlife do not imply direct bacteria transmission from humans. Thus, in areas of low human density, human-wildlife E. coli transmission seems to be low. The presence of antibiotic-resistant isolates in gorillas may be better explained by other mechanisms for resistance acquisition, such as horizontal gene exchange among bacteria or naturally acquired resistance."
The evolution of African great ape subtelomeric heterochromatin and the fusion of human chromosome 2,"['Ventura, M', 'Catacchio, CR', 'Sajjadian, S', 'Vives, L', 'Sudmant, PH', 'Marques-Bonet, T', 'Graves, TA', 'Wilson, RK', 'Eichler, EE']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.136556.111,JUN 2012,8,"Chimpanzee and gorilla chromosomes differ from human chromosomes by the presence of large blocks of subterminal heterochromatin thought to be composed primarily of arrays of tandem satellite sequence. We explore their sequence composition and organization and show a complex organization composed of specific sets of segmental duplications that have hyperexpanded in concert with the formation of subterminal satellites. These regions are highly copy number polymorphic between and within species, and copy number differences involving hundreds of copies can be accurately estimated by assaying read-depth of next-generation sequencing data sets. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses suggest that the structures have arisen largely independently in the two lineages with the exception of a few seed sequences present in the common ancestor of humans and African apes. We propose a model where an ancestral human-chimpanzee pericentric inversion and the ancestral chromosome 2 fusion both predisposed and protected the chimpanzee and human genomes, respectively, to the formation of subtelomeric heterochromatin. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between duplicated sequences and chromosomal rearrangements that rapidly alter the cytogenetic landscape in a short period of evolutionary time."
"Tooth Chipping as a Tool to Reconstruct Diets of Great Apes (Pongo, Gorilla, Pan)","['Constantino, PJ', 'Markham, K', 'Lucas, PW']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-012-9595-2,JUN 2012,7,"Most methods of dietary reconstruction are limited in their applicability to either extant or extinct taxa. We apply and discuss a method in which dietary information can be reconstructed from chips in the tooth enamel of both living and fossil primates. Such chips can be used to indicate the presence of large hard foods in the diet, and also to provide an estimate of the bite force that was used when the chip was created. Furthermore, the equations derived from this method allow an estimate of maximum bite force to be obtained from a simple measurement of tooth size. We use this method to investigate dietary differences in nonhuman great apes (Pongo, Gorilla, Pan). The high frequency of chips on teeth of Pongo indicate that they frequently use high forces to process hard foods such as seeds and nuts. Gorilla can generate even higher bite forces, but their low incidence of tooth chips suggests that they do so when consuming soft but tough foods. Tooth chips provide a lasting dietary signal that is not easily masked or erased, making them particularly useful for the study of rarely eaten items such as some fallback foods."
To Each According to his Need?

By comparing a variety of species, spanning from New World and Old World monkeys to great apes, scientists can begin to answer questions about how the response to inequity evolved, what the function of this response is, and why and how different contexts shape it. In particular, research across non-human primate species suggests that the response is quite variable across species, contexts, and individuals. In this paper, we aim to review these differences in an attempt to identify and better understand the patterns that emerge from the existing data with the goal of developing directions for future research. To begin, we address the importance of considering socio-ecological factors in non-human primates in order to better understand and predict expected patterns of cooperation and aversion to inequity in different species, following which we provide a detailed analysis of the patterns uncovered by these comparisons. Ultimately, we use this synthesis to propose new ideas for research to better understand this response and, hence, the evolution of our own responses to inequity."

We conducted a comparative study of extant primates to examine whether their teeth also adapt to foods through variation in the mechanical properties of the enamel. Nanoindentation techniques were used to map profiles of elastic modulus and hardness across tooth sections from the enamel-dentin junction to the outer enamel surface in a broad sample of primates including apes, Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, and lemurs. The measured data profiles feature considerable overlap among species, indicating a high degree of commonality in mechanical properties. These results suggest that differences in the load-bearing capacity of primate molar teeth are more a function of morphologyparticularly tooth size and enamel thicknessthan of underlying mechanical properties.

Linear enamel hypoplasia as an indicator of physiological stress in great apes: Reviewing the evidence in light of enamel growth variation,"['Guatelli-Steinberg, D', 'Ferrell, RJ', 'Spence, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21619,JUN 2012,7,"Physiological stress, such as malnutrition or illness, can disrupt normal enamel growth, resulting in linear enamel hypoplasias (LEHs). Although ecological factors may contribute to LEH expression, other factors, such as surface abrasion and enamel growth variables, are also likely to be involved. Attention to these other factors is necessary before we can begin to understand what LEH might signify in terms of ecological sources of physiological stress in non-human primates. This study focuses on assessing the contribution of these other factors to variation in LEH expression within and across great ape taxa. Here, we present LEH data from unabraded crown regions in samples of seven great ape species. We analyze these data with respect to lateral enamel formation time and the angles that striae of Retzius make with the enamel surface, as these variables are expected to affect variation in LEH expression. We find that although the duration of enamel formation is associated with sex differences in LEH expression, it is not clearly related to taxonomic variation in LEH expression, and does not explain the low frequency of LEH in mountain gorillas found in this and a previous study. Our data on striae of Retzius angles suggest that these influence LEH expression along the tooth crown and may contribute to the consistently high frequencies of LEH seen in Pongo in this and previous studies. We suggest that future work aimed at understanding species variation in these angles is crucial to evaluating taxonomic patterns of LEH expression in great apes. Am J Phys Anthropol 148:191204, 2012.

Previously, paleo-diet reconstructions were performed using different methods based on extant primate models. In particular, dental microwear or isotopic analyses provided accurate reconstructions for some fossil primates. However, there is sometimes difficult or impossible to apply these methods to fossil material. Therefore, the development of new, independent methods of diet reconstructions is crucial to improve our knowledge of primates paleobiology and paleoecology. This study aims to investigate the correlation between tooth root apical morphology and diet in primates, and its potential for paleo-diet reconstructions. Dental roots are composed of two portions: the eruptive portion with a smooth and regular surface, and the apical penetrative portion which displays an irregular and corrugated surface. Here, the angle formed by these two portions (aPE), and the ratio of penetrative portion over total root length (PPI), are calculated for each mandibular tooth root. A strong correlation between these two variables and the proportion of some food types (fruits, leaves, seeds, animal matter, and vertebrates) in diet is found, allowing the use of tooth root apical morphology as a tool for dietary reconstructions in primates. The method was then applied to the fossil hominoid Khoratpithecus piriyai, from the Late Miocene of Thailand. The paleo-diet deduced from aPE and PPI is dominated by fruits (>50%), associated with animal matter (125%). Leaves, vertebrates and most probably seeds were excluded from the diet of Khoratpithecus, which is consistent with previous studies. Anat Rec, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Apes are also infected with other retroviruses, notably simian T-cell lymphotropic viruses (STLVs) and simian foamy viruses (SFVs), that can be transmitted to humans. We discuss the actual knowledge on SIV, STLV and SFV infections in chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos. We especially elaborate on how the recent development of non-invasive methods has allowed us to identify the reservoirs of the HIV-1 ancestors in chimpanzees and gorillas, and increased our knowledge of the natural history of SIV infections in chimpanzees. Multiple cross-species events with retroviruses from apes to humans have occurred, but only one transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees in south-eastern Cameroon spread worldwide, and is responsible for the actual HIV pandemic. Frequent SFV transmissions have been recently reported, but no human-to-human transmission has been documented yet. Because humans are still in contact with apes, identification of pathogens in wild ape populations can signal which pathogens may be cause risk for humans, and allow the development of serological and molecular assays with which to detect transmissions to humans. Finally, non-invasive sampling also allows the study of the impact of retroviruses and other pathogens on the health and survival of endangered species such as chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos."
"Subpopulation range estimation for conservation planning: a case study of the critically endangered Cross River gorilla
","['Sawyer, SC']",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,10.1007/s10531-012-0266-6,JUN 2012,3,"Measuring and characterizing the area utilized by a population or species is essential for assessment of conservation status and for effective allocation of habitat to ensure population persistence. Yet population-level range delineation is complicated by the variety of available techniques coupled with a lack of empirical methods to compare the relative value of these techniques. This study assesses the effect of model choice on resulting subpopulation range estimation for the critically endangered and patchily distributed Cross River gorilla, and evaluates the conservation conclusions that can be drawn from each model. Models considered range from basic traditional approaches (e.g. minimum convex polygon) to newer home range techniques such as local convex hull (LoCoH). Overlap analysis comparing sub-sampled to complete data sets are used to evaluate the robustness of various modeling techniques to data limitations. Likelihood cross validation criterion is employed to compare core range model performance. Results suggest that differing LoCoH models produce similar range estimates, are robust to data requirements, provide a good fit for core habitat estimation, and are best able to detect unused habitat within the subpopulation range. LoCoH methods may thus be useful for studies into habitat selection and factors limiting endangered species distributions. However, LoCoH models tend to over-fit data, and kernel methods may provide similar information about animal space use while supporting protection of larger swaths of critical habitat. Subpopulation range analyses for conservation/management planning should therefore explore multiple modeling techniques, and employ both qualitative and quantitative assessments to select the best models to inform decision making for species of conservation concern."

In this review, we show how studies of the microorganisms of wild great apes can lead to the discovery of novel pathogens of importance for humans. We also illustrate how these primates, living in their natural habitats, can serve as sentinels for outbreaks of human disease in regions with a high likelihood of disease emergence. Greater sampling efforts and improvements in sample preservation and diagnostic capacity are rapidly improving our understanding of the diversity and distribution of microorganisms in wild great apes. Linking non-invasive diagnostic data with observational health data from great apes habituated to human presence is a promising approach for the discovery of pathogens of high relevance for humans."

Recovery Potential of a Western Lowland Gorilla Population following a Major Ebola Outbreak: Results from a Ten Year Study,"['Genton, C', 'Cristescu, R', 'Gatti, S', 'Levrero, F', 'Bigot, E', 'Caillaud, D', 'Pierre, JS', 'Menard, N']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0037106,MAY 23 2012,6,"Investigating the recovery capacity of wildlife populations following demographic crashes is of great interest to ecologists and conservationists. Opportunities to study these aspects are rare due to the difficulty of monitoring populations both before and after a demographic crash. Ebola outbreaks in central Africa have killed up to 95% of the individuals in affected western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) populations. Assessing whether and how fast affected populations recover is essential for the conservation of this critically endangered taxon. The gorilla population visiting Lokoue forest clearing, Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Republic of the Congo, has been monitored before, two years after and six years after Ebola affected it in 2004. This allowed us to describe Ebola's short-term and long-term impacts on the structure of the population. The size of the population, which included around 380 gorillas before the Ebola outbreak, dropped to less than 40 individuals after the outbreak. It then remained stable for six years after the outbreak. However, the demographic structure of this small population has significantly changed. Although several solitary males have disappeared, the immigration of adult females, the formation of new breeding groups, and several birth events suggest that the population is showing potential to recover. During the outbreak, surviving adult and subadult females joined old solitary silverbacks. Those females were subsequently observed joining young silverbacks, forming new breeding groups where they later gave birth. Interestingly, some females were observed joining silverbacks that were unlikely to have sired their infant, but no infanticide was observed. The consequences of the Ebola outbreak on the population structure were different two years and six years after the outbreak. Therefore, our results could be used as demographic indicators to detect and date outbreaks that have happened in other, non-monitored gorilla populations."
Co-Evolution of Primate SAMHD1 and Lentivirus Vpx Leads to the Loss of the vpx Gene in HIV-1 Ancestor,"['Zhang, CY', 'de Silva, S', 'Wang, JH', 'Wu, L']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0037477,MAY 4 2012,20,"Cross-species transmission and adaptation of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) to humans have given rise to human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs). HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) were derived from SIVs that infected chimpanzee (SIVcpz) and sooty mangabey (SIVsm), respectively. The HIV-1 restriction factor SAMHD1 inhibits HIV-1 infection in human myeloid cells and can be counteracted by the Vpx protein of HIV-2 and the SIVsm lineage. However, HIV-1 and its ancestor SIVcpz do not encode a Vpx protein and HIV-1 has not evolved a mechanism to overcome SAMHD1-mediated restriction. Here we show that the co-evolution of primate SAMHD1 and lentivirus Vpx leads to the loss of the vpx gene in SIVcpz and HIV-1. We found evidence for positive selection of SAMHD1 in orangutan, gibbon, rhesus macaque, and marmoset, but not in human, chimpanzee and gorilla that are natural hosts of Vpx-negative HIV-1, SIVcpz and SIVgor, respectively, indicating that vpx drives the evolution of primate SAMHD1. Ancestral host state reconstruction and temporal dynamic analyses suggest that the most recent common ancestor of SIVrcm, SIVmnd, SIVcpz, SIVgor and HIV-1 was a SIV that had a vpx gene; however, the vpx gene of SIVcpz was lost approximately 3643 to 2969 years ago during the infection of chimpanzees. Thus, HIV-1 could not inherit the lost vpx gene from its ancestor SIVcpz. The lack of Vpx in HIV-1 results in restricted infection in myeloid cells that are important for antiviral immunity, which could contribute to the AIDS pandemic by escaping the immune responses."

We find that alternative dispersal patterns, for example among gorillas or gibbons, could explain the findings of related or natal males in a confined geographic area. Based on sexual size dimorphism, we speculate that gorillas might currently be the best model for reconstructing dispersal in robust australopiths. Given that the sexual size dimorphism in other australopiths is still hotly debated, the question of which hominoid model best matches their dispersal pattern must remain unanswered. Neandertal dispersal patterns have been compared to patrilocality of modern humans. However, the latter is related to the advent of food production. Consequently, hunter-gatherers exhibiting primarily multilocality appear to be the better comparison for Neandertals. Overall, human-like patrilocality and Pan-like male philopatry appear to be poor models for the reconstruction of dispersal patterns in Plio-Pleistocene hominins. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

We present the findings of a 9-month study of a small group (one male, two females) of Western lowland gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla. First, we examined the effect of environmental variables on gorilla behavior. Second, we examined the effect of environmental variables on the concentration of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGC) and the relationship between behavior and FGC. Environmental variables had similar effects on all three gorillas. Negative vigilance of visitors (NVV; staring, posturing, and charging at visitors) significantly increased in all subjects as environmental noise levels increased, and food-related behavior significantly decreased in all subjects as crowd size increased. Exhibit modifications had a number of positive effects on behavior. Notably, when privacy screens were used, NVV significantly decreased in two subjects. We found no significant effects of environmental variables on FGC. However, we did find significant relationships between behavior and FGC in one female. Specifically, her NVV was significantly higher one day before, and on the same day as, raised FGC. Also, hair plucking significantly increased in the two days following raised FGC.

The focal females exhibited affiliative, aggressive, and activity budget data evenly across their cycles. There were also no temporal trends in proximity to the silverback. Females varied by the types of estrous behavior they exhibited. We give a hormonal explanation for the prevalence of estrous behaviors in week one, and recommendations for effective behavioral sampling of gorilla estrous behavior. Zoo Biol 31:350361, 2012.

Do naturalistic enclosures provide suitable environments for zoo animals?,"['Fabregas, MC', 'Guillen-Salazar, F', 'Garces-Narro, C']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20404,MAY-JUN 2012,2,"Zoo visitors perceive naturalistic enclosures (i.e. those attempting to replicate identifiable parts of the landscape of the species' habitat) as those that best satisfy the biological needs of the animals, and ensure therefore their welfare. However, the provision of a suitable environment with the resources that will allow the animals to satisfy their main biological needs in naturalistic enclosures has never been systematically explored; instead, it has been assumed. In this study we provide evidence that supports the general idea that naturalistic designs provide suitable environments for the animals. For that purpose, we analyzed 1,381 naturalistic and non-naturalistic enclosures in 63 Spanish zoological parks. In order to assess the suitability of the environment provided within each enclosure, a number of aspects related to the animals' main biological requirements were analyzed. We found a relationship between naturalistic designs and the suitability of the environment for the species housed. Most naturalistic enclosures (77.8%) provided suitable environments for their inhabitants. Non-naturalistic ones also had suitable environments, but in a lower percentage (39.7%). These results should be taken into account during zoo inspection and accreditation appointments, where enclosure suitability must be assessed in an accurate and fast manner. In this regard, a naturalistic design can be used as an adjunct indicator of enclosure suitability, but not exclusively, as not every naturalistic enclosure was suitable for the animals, neither as an indispensable one, given that near 40% of non-naturalistic ones were appropriate for the species housed.

Estrogenic plant foods of red colobus monkeys and mountain gorillas in uganda,"['Wasserman, MD', 'Taylor-Gutt, A', 'Rothman, JM', 'Chapman, CA', 'Milton, K', 'Leitman, DC']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22045,MAY 2012,5,"Phytoestrogens, or naturally occurring estrogen-mimicking compounds, are found in many human plant foods, such as soybeans (Glycine max) and other legumes. Because the consumption of phytoestrogens may result in both health benefits of protecting against estrogen-dependent cancers and reproductive costs of disrupting the developing endocrine system, considerable biomedical research has been focused on the physiological and behavioral effects of these compounds. Despite this interest, little is known about the occurrence of phytoestrogens in the diets of wild primates, nor their likely evolutionary importance. We investigated the prevalence of estrogenic plant foods in the diets of two folivorous primate species, the red colobus monkey (Procolobus rufomitratus) of Kibale National Park and mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei) of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, both in Uganda. To examine plant foods for estrogenic activity, we screened 44 plant items (species and part) comprising 78.4% of the diet of red colobus monkeys and 53 plant items comprising 85.2% of the diet of mountain gorillas using transient transfection assays. At least 10.6% of the red colobus diet and 8.8% of the gorilla diet had estrogenic activity. This was mainly the result of the red colobus eating three estrogenic staple foods and the gorillas eating one estrogenic staple food. All estrogenic plants exhibited estrogen receptor (ER) subtype selectivity, as their phytoestrogens activated ER beta, but not ERa. These results demonstrate that estrogenic plant foods are routinely consumed by two folivorous primate species. Phytoestrogens in the wild plant foods of these two species and many other wild primates may have important implications for understanding primate reproductive ecology. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2012.

Information seeking by orangutans: a generalized search strategy?,"['Marsh, HL', 'MacDonald, SE']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0453-y,MAY 2012,16,"Recent empirical work has suggested that some species of non-human primates may be aware of their knowledge states. One finding to support this claim is that they seek information about the location of a hidden food item when they are unsure of its location, but not when they already know where it is, which purportedly demonstrates metacognition. However, this behaviour may instead reflect a generalized search strategy, in which subjects reach for food when they see it, and search for it when they do not. In this experiment, this possibility was addressed by testing orangutans in three conditions in which the location of a food item was sometimes known to subjects, and other times required subjects to visually seek the missing information. All subjects exhibited behaviour consistent with a metacognitive interpretation in at least two of the three conditions. Critically, in two of the conditions, subjects refrained from seeking visual information, and correctly found the hidden food item without ever seeing it, using inference by exclusion. The results suggest that animals that succeed in this information-seeking task are not merely acting according to a generalized search strategy, and instead seek information adaptively according to their knowledge states."
Orangutan Alu quiescence reveals possible source element: support for ancient backseat drivers,"['Walker, JA', 'Konkel, MK', 'Ullmer, B', 'Monceaux, CP', 'Ryder, OA', 'Hubley, R', 'Smit, AFA', 'Batzer, MA']",MOBILE DNA,10.1186/1759-8753-3-8,APR 30 2012,6,"Background: Sequence analysis of the orangutan genome revealed that recent proliferative activity of Alu elements has been uncharacteristically quiescent in the Pongo (orangutan) lineage, compared with all previously studied primate genomes. With relatively few young polymorphic insertions, the genomic landscape of the orangutan seemed like the ideal place to search for a driver, or source element, of Alu retrotransposition.

Results: Here we report the identification of a nearly pristine insertion possessing all the known putative hallmarks of a retrotranspositionally competent Alu element. It is located in an intronic sequence of the DGKB gene on chromosome 7 and is highly conserved in Hominidae (the great apes), but absent from Hylobatidae (gibbon and siamang). We provide evidence for the evolution of a lineage-specific subfamily of this shared Alu insertion in orangutans and possibly the lineage leading to humans. In the orangutan genome, this insertion contains three orangutan-specific diagnostic mutations which are characteristic of the youngest polymorphic Alu subfamily, AluYe5b5_Pongo. In the Homininae lineage (human, chimpanzee and gorilla), this insertion has acquired three different mutations which are also found in a single human-specific Alu insertion.

Conclusions: This seemingly stealth-like amplification, ongoing at a very low rate over millions of years of evolution, suggests that this shared insertion may represent an ancient backseat driver of Alu element expansion."
"Oxidized Phospholipids Are Present on Plasminogen, Affect Fibrinolysis, and Increase Following Acute Myocardial Infarction","['Leibundgut, G', 'Arai, K', 'Orsoni, A', 'Yin, HY', 'Scipione, C', 'Miller, ER', 'Koschinsky, ML', 'Chapman, MJ', 'Witztum, JL', 'Tsimikas, S']",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jacc.2011.12.033,APR 17 2012,17,"Objectives

This study sought to assess whether plasminogen, which is homologous to lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], contains proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) and whether this has clinical relevance.

Background

OxPL measured on apolipoprotein B-100 (OxPL/apoB), primarily reflecting OxPL on Lp(a), independently predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.

Methods

The authors examined plasminogen from commercially available preparations and plasma from chimpanzees; gorillas; bonobos; cynomolgus monkeys; wild-type, apoE(-/-), LDLR-/-, and Lp(a)-transgenic mice; healthy humans; and patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, stable CVD, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Phosphocholine (PC)-containing OxPL (OxPC) present on plasminogen were detected directly with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and immunologically with monoclonal antibody E06. In vitro clot lysis assays were performed to assess the effect of the OxPL on plasminogen on fibrinolysis.

Results

LC-MS/MS revealed that OxPC fragments were covalently bound to mouse plasminogen. Immunoblot, immuno-precipitation, density gradient ultracentrifugation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses demonstrated that all human and animal plasma samples tested contained OxPL covalently bound to plasminogen. In plasma samples subjected to density gradient fractionation, OxPL were present on plasminogen (OxPL/plasminogen) in non-lipoprotein fractions but on Lp(a) in lipoprotein fractions. Plasma levels of OxPL/apoB and OxPL/apo(a) varied significantly (>25X) among subjects and also strongly correlated with Lp(a) levels. In contrast, OxPL/plasminogen levels were distributed across a relatively narrow range and did not correlate with Lp(a). Enzymatic removal of OxPL from plasminogen resulted in a longer lysis time for fibrin clots (16.25 vs. 11.96 min, p = 0.007). In serial measurements over 7 months, OxPL/plasminogen levels did not vary in normal subjects or in patients with stable CVD, but increased acutely over the first month and then slowly decreased to baseline in patients following AMI.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate that plasminogen contains covalently bound OxPL that influence fibrinolysis. OxPL/plasminogen represent a second major plasma pool of OxPL, in addition to those present on Lp(a). OxPL present on plasminogen may have pathophysiological implications in AMI and atherothrombosis.

In both tasks, children and chimpanzees were able to coordinate two complementary roles with peers and solve the problem cooperatively. This is the first experimental demonstration of the coordination of complementary roles in chimpanzees. In the second task, neither species was skillful at waiting for a partner to be positioned appropriately before beginning (although children did hesitate significantly longer when the partner was absent). The main difference between species in both tasks was in children's, but not chimpanzees', ability to profit from experience as a collaborator in one role when later reversing roles. This difference suggests that as they participate in a collaboration, young children integrate both roles into a single ""birds-eye-view"" representational format in a way that chimpanzees do not.

"Remote sensing analysis reveals habitat, dispersal corridors and expanded distribution for the Critically Endangered Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli","['Bergl, RA', 'Warren, Y', 'Nicholas, A', 'Dunn, A', 'Imong, I', 'Sunderland-Groves, JL', 'Oates, JF']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605310001857,APR 2012,12,"Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the major threats to wildlife populations in tropical forests. Loss of habitat reduces the carrying capacity of the landscape and fragmentation disrupts biological processes and exposes wildlife populations to the effects of small population size, such as reduction of genetic diversity and increased impact of demographic stochasticity. The Critically Endangered Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli is threatened in particular by habitat disturbance because its population is small and it lives in an area where high human population density results in intense exploitation of natural resources. We used remotely-sensed data to assess the extent and distribution of gorilla habitat in the Cross River region and delineated potential dispersal corridors. Our analysis revealed >8,000 km(2) of tropical forest in the study region, 2,500 km(2) of which is in or adjacent to areas occupied by gorillas. We surveyed 12 areas of forest identified as potential gorilla habitat, 10 of which yielded new records of gorillas. The new records expand the known range of the Cross River gorilla by >50%, and support genetic analyses that suggest greater connectivity of the population than previously assumed. These findings demonstrate that considerable connected forest habitat remains and that the area could potentially support a much larger gorilla population if anthropogenic pressures such as hunting could be reduced."
"Epidemiology and Molecular Relationships of Cryptosporidium spp. in People, Primates, and Livestock from Western Uganda","['Salyer, SJ', 'Gillespie, TR', 'Rwego, IB', 'Chapman, CA', 'Goldberg, TL']",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,10.1371/journal.pntd.0001597,APR 2012,20,"Background: Cryptosporidium is one of the most common parasitic diarrheal agents in the world and is a known zoonosis. We studied Cryptosporidium in people, livestock, and non-human primates in the region of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Land use change near the park has resulted in fragmented forest patches containing small, remnant populations of wild primates that interact intensively with local people and livestock. Our goal was to investigate risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection and to assess cross-species transmission using molecular methods.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Diagnostic PCR revealed a prevalence of Cryptosporidium of 32.4% in humans, 11.1% in non-human primates, and 2.2% in livestock. In the case of humans, residence in one particular community was associated with increased risk of infection, as was fetching water from an open water source. Although 48.5% of infected people reported gastrointestinal symptoms, this frequency was not significantly different in people who tested negative (44.7%) for Cryptosporidium, nor was co-infection with Giardia duodenalis associated with increased reporting of gastrointestinal symptoms. Fecal consistency was no different in infected versus uninfected people or animals. DNA sequences of the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein gene placed all infections within a well-supported C. parvum/C. hominis clade. However, the only two sequences recovered from primates in the core of the park's protected area fell into a divergent sub-clade and were identical to published sequences from C. parvum, C. hominis, and C. cuniculus, suggesting the possibility of a separate sylvatic transmission cycle.

Conclusions/Significance: Cryptosporidium may be transmitted frequently among species in western Uganda where people, livestock, and wildlife interact intensively as a result of anthropogenic changes to forests, but the parasite may undergo more host-specific transmission where such interactions do not occur. The parasite does not appear to have strong effects on human or animal health, perhaps because of persistent low-level shedding and immunity."
Phenotypic correlates of male reproductive success in western gorillas,"['Breuer, T', 'Robbins, AM', 'Boesch, C', 'Robbins, MM']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.01.006,APR 2012,13,"Sexual selection is thought to drive the evolution of sexually dimorphic traits that increase male reproductive success. Despite a large degree of sexual dimorphism among haplorhine primates, phenotypic traits that may influence the reproductive success of males are largely unstudied due to long life spans and the difficulties in quantifying such traits non-invasively. Here we employ digital photogrammetry of body length and crest size, as well as ranking of the gluteal muscle size, to test whether these sexually dimorphic traits are associated with long-term measures of male reproductive success in western gorillas. Among 19 adult male gorillas monitored for up to 12.5 years, we found that all three phenotypic traits were positively correlated with the average number of mates per male, but only crest size and gluteal muscle size were significantly correlated with offspring survival and the annual rate of siring offspring that survive to weaning age. We discuss why such sexually dimorphic traits might be under ongoing selection in gorillas and other species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Long-Term Balancing Selection at the Antiviral Gene OAS1 in Central African Chimpanzees,"['Ferguson, W', 'Dvora, S', 'Fikes, RW', 'Stone, AC', 'Boissinot, S']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msr247,APR 2012,8,"Oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) are interferon-induced enzymes that participate in the first line of defense against a wide range of viral infection in animals. Upon activation by viral double-stranded RNA, OAS synthesizes (2-5) oligoadenylates, which activate RNase L, leading to the nonspecific degradation of cellular and viral RNA. Some association studies in humans suggest that variation at one of the OAS genes, OAS1, could be influencing host susceptibility to viral infection. We assessed the diversity of OAS1 in hominoid primates with a focus on chimpanzees. We found that the OAS1 gene is extremely polymorphic in Central African chimpanzee and exhibits levels of silent and replacement diversity much higher than neutral regions of the chimpanzee genome. This level of variation strongly suggests that balancing selection is acting on OAS1, and indeed, this conclusion was validated by several tests of neutrality. We further demonstrated that balancing selection has been acting at this locus since the split between chimpanzees, humans, and gorillas (similar to 8.6 Ma) and caused the persistence of two deeply divergent allelic lineages in Central African chimpanzees. These two groups of OAS1 alleles differ by a large number of amino acids (a.a.), including several a.a. putatively involved in RNA binding. It is therefore very likely that variation at the OAS1 locus affects the innate immune response of individuals to specific viral infection. Our data strongly suggest that interactions between viral RNA and OAS1 are responsible for the maintenance of ancestral polymorphisms at this locus for at least 13.2 My."

This study, using an habituation/dishabituation task, provides experimental evidence for a core olfactory ability, namely, olfactory discrimination, in the gorilla. In Experiment 1, six zoo-housed western lowland gorillas were individually presented with the same odour on four trials, and with a novel odour on the fifth trial. Odours (almond and vanilla) were presented on plastic balls, and behavioural responses of sniffing and chewing/licking the balls were recorded. A second experiment presented the same odour on four trials and no odour on the fifth to examine whether any dishabituation was due to the presence of a new odour or the absence of the familiar odour. Gorillas habituated their behaviour with repeated presentation of the same odour, but dishabituated, i.e. increased sniffing and chewing/licking, when presented with the novel odour. No dishabituation was noted when using water as the stimulus across all trials or when used as the novel odour. Overall, results show that gorillas are able to discriminate between odours."

Here, we present a comparative baseline series of dental microwear textures for a sample of 21 anthropoid primate species displaying interspecific and intraspecific dietary variability. Four dental microwear texture variables (complexity, anisotropy, textural fill volume, and heterogeneity) were computed based on scale-sensitive fractal analysis and high-resolution three-dimensional renderings of microwear surfaces collected using a white-light confocal profiler. The purpose of this analysis was to assess the extent to which these variables reflect variation in diet. Significant contrasts between species with diets known to include foods with differing material properties are clearly evident for all four microwear texture variables. In particular, species that consume more tough foods, such as leaves, tended to have high levels of anisotropy and low texture complexity. The converse was true for species including hard and brittle items in their diets either as staples or as fallback foods. These results reaffirm the utility of dental microwear texture analysis as an important tool in making dietary inferences based on fossil primate samples. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2012.

We present an in-depth study of nest-building by unhabituated chimpanzees at the Seringbara study site in the Nimba Mountains, Guinea, West Africa. We recorded 1520 chimpanzee nests over 28 mo during three study periods between 2003 and 2008. We investigated where chimpanzees built their nests, both across the home range and in nest trees, and assessed how altitude and habitat type affected nest site selectivity. We examined whether or not chimpanzees were selective in nest tree choice regarding physical tree characteristics and tree species and assessed plant species preference for both tree- and ground-nesting. We tested three, nonmutually exclusive, hypotheses for the function of arboreal nest-building. We assessed whether selectivity for nest tree characteristics reflected an antipredator strategy, examined whether nesting patterns (both arboreal and terrestrial) and nesting height were influenced by variation in climatic conditions (temperature, humidity, wind), and measured mosquito densities at ground level and in trees at 10 m and related mosquito densities to nesting patterns. Chimpanzees preferred to nest above 1000 m and nested mainly in primary forest. They preferred relatively large trees with a low first branch, dense canopy, and small leaves and showed preference for particular tree species, which was stable across years, whereas plant choice for ground-nesting was largely based on plant availability. We found no support for the antipredation hypothesis, nor did mosquito densities explain arboreal nest-building. The thermoregulation hypothesis was supported, as both nesting patterns and nest-height variation across seasons reflected a humidity-avoidance strategy. Chimpanzees nested higher in trees and at higher altitudes in the wet season. In sum, chimpanzees were selective in their choice of nest sites, locations, and materials, and tree-nesting patterns at Seringbara were best explained by a thermoregulation strategy of humidity avoidance."
"Interspecific and Ontogenetic Variation in Proximal Pedal Phalangeal Curvature of Great Apes (Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Pongo pygmaeus)","['Congdon, KA', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-012-9590-7,APR 2012,3,"Considerable attention has been devoted to understanding phalangeal curvature in primates, particularly with regard to locomotion. Previous work has found that increased phalangeal curvature may be indicative of increased grasping during suspensory and climbing behaviors, but the details of this relationship, particularly as regards feet, is still unclear. Using behavioral studies to predict an interspecific gradient of variation in pedal phalangeal curvature, I collected digital data from the third and fifth digit proximal pedal phalanges in adult Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Pongo pygmaeus and calculated included angles of phalangeal curvature to assess the appropriateness of pooling digits within taxa and evaluate the association between variation in pedal phalangeal curvature and frequency of climbing behavior. I also used an ontogenetic sample of Pan troglodytes to evaluate the postnatal relationship between variation in phalangeal curvature and grasping behaviors. I found intraspecific variation in phalangeal curvature suggesting among-digit variation in grasping behaviors. Curvature of Pongo was significantly greater than of both Pan and Gorilla. In contrast, Pan was significantly more curved than Gorilla only in comparison of third digits. Ontogenetic decreases in pedal phalangeal curvature among Pan troglodytes accorded well with postnatal decreases in documented climbing frequency. These findings largely support earlier work regarding the association between arboreal grasping and phalangeal curvature, and provide a unique intraspecific analysis that illuminates a number of areas where our knowledge of the behavioral and biomechanical determinants of phalangeal curvature should be explored further, particularly with respect to the role of among-digit variation in phalangeal curvature."

These populations are often unhabituated, elusive, and contain few individuals, making them difficult to study through direct observation. Noninvasive genetic methods are useful for surveying these unhabituated populations to infer the number and sex of individuals and the genetic diversity of the population. We conducted genetic analysis on 70 fecal samples from eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in Gishwati Forest Reserve, a forest fragment in western Rwanda. We genotyped all but two of these samples using 12 autosomal and 13 Y-chromosome microsatellite markers previously used in analyses of other chimpanzee populations. The genetic data show that these samples represent a minimum of 19 individuals (7 females, 12 males). However, because we may not have sampled all individuals in the population, we also performed mark-recapture analysis with the genetic data and found that the entire population likely numbers between 19 and 29 individuals. These results are consistent with opportunistic observations of at least 19 individual chimpanzees. Levels of variation at the Y-chromosome microsatellites were similar to those observed in other chimpanzee communities, suggesting that the chimpanzees in this forest are members of a single community. These results provide a baseline count of the number of male and female chimpanzees in the Gishwati Forest Reserve, and the data provide the potential for follow-up studies aimed at tracking individuals over time, thus aiding conservation management of this unhabituated population."

Methods Necropsy and histopathology was performed to identify the cause of the disease in an cachectic 50-year-old western lowland gorilla. Immunohistochemistry for Ki67, oestrogen receptor alpha and ERBB2 was performed to characterize the tumor. In addition, Pan-herpesvirus and Pan-papillomavirus PCR were used to identify a possible viral cause.

Results The endoccervical carcinoma showed a severe metastatic spread to the lung, brain and bone and was herpesvirus and papillomavirus-negative. Most tumor cells were ERBB2-positive, 15% of tumor cells were Ki67positive and only few tumor cells had oestrogen receptor alpha expression.

Conclusions Histopathologically and immunohistochemically, the tumour had striking similarities to human endocervicial adenocarcinomas of the common type. However, PCR analysis failed to identify herpes-or papillomaviral DNA in the tumor at the time of necropsy, thus leaving the question for cause of the disease open."
Annotation of primate miRNAs by high throughput sequencing of small RNA libraries,"['Dannemann, M', 'Nickel, B', 'Lizano, E', 'Burbano, HA', 'Kelso, J']",BMC GENOMICS,10.1186/1471-2164-13-116,MAR 27 2012,6,"Background: In addition to genome sequencing, accurate functional annotation of genomes is required in order to carry out comparative and evolutionary analyses between species. Among primates, the human genome is the most extensively annotated. Human miRNA gene annotation is based on multiple lines of evidence including evidence for expression as well as prediction of the characteristic hairpin structure. In contrast, most miRNA genes in non-human primates are annotated based on homology without any expression evidence. We have sequenced small-RNA libraries from chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and rhesus macaque from multiple individuals and tissues. Using patterns of miRNA expression in conjunction with a model of miRNA biogenesis we used these high-throughput sequencing data to identify novel miRNAs in non-human primates.

Results: We predicted 47 new miRNAs in chimpanzee, 240 in gorilla, 55 in orangutan and 47 in rhesus macaque. The algorithm we used was able to predict 64% of the previously known miRNAs in chimpanzee, 94% in gorilla, 61% in orangutan and 71% in rhesus macaque. We therefore added evidence for expression in between one and five tissues to miRNAs that were previously annotated based only on homology to human miRNAs. We increased from 60 to 175 the number miRNAs that are located in orthologous regions in humans and the four non-human primate species studied here.

Conclusions: In this study we provide expression evidence for homology-based annotated miRNAs and predict de novo miRNAs in four non-human primate species. We increased the number of annotated miRNA genes and provided evidence for their expression in four non-human primates. Similar approaches using different individuals and tissues would improve annotation in non-human primates and allow for further comparative studies in the future."

Here, we report the inactivation of the MSLNL gene encoding mesothelin-like protein in African great ape evolution. Human MSLNL has a nonsense mutation in exon 10 and two polymorphic mutations: a frameshift in exon 3 and a nonsense codon in exon 8. The gorilla gene also shows multiple deleterious mutations, including a premature stop codon, a deletion, and a splice site mutation. Molecular evolutionary analysis indicated relaxed selection pressure on MSLNL in African great ape lineages, which suggested that MSLNL might have become inactivated before the divergence of human, chimpanzee and gorilla. The mouse Mslnl gene is highly expressed in olfactory epithelium and moderately expressed in several other tissues. We propose that the loss of MSLNL may be associated with the evolution of the olfactory system in African great apes including human. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Complete genome sequences were obtained from six of the infected chimpanzee and both gorillas; those from P. t. ellioti grouped with previously characterised variants from this subspecies. However, variants recovered from P. t. troglodytes HBV variants also grouped within this clade, indicative of transmission between sub-species, forming a paraphyletic clade. The two gorilla viruses were phylogenetically distinct from chimpanzee and human variants although one showed evidence for a recombination event with a P.t.e.-derived HBV variant in the partial X and core gene region. Both of these observations provide evidence for circulation of HBV between different species and sub-species of non-human primates, a conclusion that differs from the hypothesis if of strict host specificity of HBV genotypes."

Here we present the assembly and analysis of a genome sequence for the western lowland gorilla, and compare the whole genomes of all extant great ape genera. We propose a synthesis of genetic and fossil evidence consistent with placing the human-chimpanzee and human-chimpanzee-gorilla speciation events at approximately 6 and 10 million years ago. In 30% of the genome, gorilla is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other; this is rarer around coding genes, indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution, and has functional consequences in gene expression. A comparison of protein coding genes reveals approximately 500 genes showing accelerated evolution on each of the gorilla, human and chimpanzee lineages, and evidence for parallel acceleration, particularly of genes involved in hearing. We also compare the western and eastern gorilla species, estimating an average sequence divergence time 1.75 million years ago, but with evidence for more recent genetic exchange and a population bottleneck in the eastern species. The use of the genome sequence in these and future analyses will promote a deeper understanding of great ape biology and evolution."
Impartial Third-Party Interventions in Captive Chimpanzees: A Reflection of Community Concern,"['von Rohr, CR', 'Koski, SE', 'Burkart, JM', 'Caws, C', 'Fraser, ON', 'Ziltener, A', 'van Schaik, CP']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0032494,MAR 7 2012,19,"Because conflicts among social group members are inevitable, their management is crucial for group stability. The rarest and most interesting form of conflict management is policing, i.e., impartial interventions by bystanders, which is of considerable interest due to its potentially moral nature. Here, we provide descriptive and quantitative data on policing in captive chimpanzees. First, we report on a high rate of policing in one captive group characterized by recently introduced females and a rank reversal between two males. We explored the influence of various factors on the occurrence of policing. The results show that only the alpha and beta males acted as arbitrators using manifold tactics to control conflicts, and that their interventions strongly depended on conflict complexity. Secondly, we compared the policing patterns in three other captive chimpanzee groups. We found that although rare, policing was more prevalent at times of increased social instability, both high-ranking males and females performed policing, and conflicts of all sex-dyad combinations were policed. These results suggest that the primary function of policing is to increase group stability. It may thus reflect prosocial behaviour based upon ""community concern."" However, policing remains a rare behaviour and more data are needed to test the generality of this hypothesis."
Evolution of ape and human mating systems,"['Nakahashi, W', 'Horiuchi, S', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.11.026,MAR 7 2012,3,"Humans (Homo sapiens) generally form multiple-male-multiple-female groups that include multiple family units. This social structure is maintained because dominant males do not monopolize females and, thus, allow subordinate males to mate, and human females are not generally promiscuous. Although apes show great variation in mating systems, the human-type mating system is unique among primates. The mating systems of apes and humans have evolved in response to their adaptation to different ecological conditions. We created and analyzed a mathematical model to investigate the conditions for each type of mating system to evolve. We focused on the mating strategy of alpha males and the mating and grouping strategies of females. We defined the human-type mating system as one with multiple-male-multiple-female groups in which alpha males do not monopolize females and females are not promiscuous. We demonstrated that the human-type mating system could evolve when a large group is advantageous and the cost of female promiscuity is great. Moreover, the human- and Pan-type mating systems can be bistable. Our results shed light on the origin of the human family. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Due to the high incidence of human exposure to body fluids of non-human primates, the significant prevalence of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in non-human primates, and hunting/butchering associated cross-species transmission of other retroviruses in Central Africa, it is possible that SIV is actively transmitted to humans from primate species other than mangabeys, chimpanzees, and/or gorillas. We evaluated SIV transmission to humans by screening 2,436 individuals that hunt and butcher non-human primates, a population in which simian foamy virus and simian T-lymphotropic virus were previously detected. We identified 23 individuals with high seroreactivity to SIV. Nucleic acid sequences of SIV genes could not be detected, suggesting that SIV infection in humans could occur at a lower frequency than infections with other retroviruses, including simian foamy virus and simian T-lymphotropic virus. Additional studies on human populations at risk for non-human primate zoonosis are necessary to determine whether these results are due to viral/host characteristics or are indicative of low SIV prevalence in primate species consumed as bushmeat as compared to other retroviruses in Cameroon."
The Effect of Feeding Enrichment Methods on the Behavior of Captive Western Lowland Gorillas,"['Ryan, EB', 'Proudfoot, KL', 'Fraser, D']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20403,MAR-APR 2012,1,"Three feeding enrichment treatments were tested in an outdoor yard used by six Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). In ""Yard-toss,"" forage was thrown by hand over one third of the yard. In ""Set-up,"" forage and browse were hand-scattered throughout the yard. ""Set-up Enriched"" was similar with the addition of either a hay- and forage-filled feeder or forage-filled boomer ball(s) suspended from a climbing structure. Each treatment was presented on 5 d. Behavior was recorded for 30 min before (baseline) and 30 min after the start of each treatment. All treatments led to more foraging and less inactivity compared with baseline (P<0.05), but Yard-toss was the least effective, likely because resources were clumped and monopolized by dominant animals. In Set-up Enriched, dominant animals had the greatest increase in foraging (P=0.03), partly because they generally monopolized the suspended items, but this allowed others to forage at ground level. This separation of the animals likely explains why Set-Up Enriched led to more foraging than all other treatments (P<0.05). Findings show that for these hierarchical animals, enrichment resources are most effective when distributed widely, including vertically, and that enrichment strategies must take social structure into account.

In 2009, a Western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at the Buffalo Zoo was observed using a bucket, which had been provided as part of normal enrichment, as a tool to collect water. We conducted a brief, ad libitum investigation to confirm the validity of the initial observation. We then carried out a systematic investigation of the behavior in 2010. We collected 72 hr of videotaped data and tested the null hypothesis that the gorillas did not differ in their prevalence of engaging in bucket-use behaviors. We documented that all four adult gorillas in the group used buckets as drinking tools; however, there was significant individual variation in frequency and type of use of buckets. Four of the eight behaviors showed significant variation among individuals. The silverback male and the youngest adult female contacted and held the bucket significantly more than the remaining two adult females. The young female carried and drank from the bucket significantly more than any other individual. Furthermore, she was observed to fill the bucket with water four of the six times during which this behavior was observed. These data provide evidence of the ability of gorillas to utilize tools, given the appropriate environmental conditions. We continue to explore the abilities of gorillas to recognize the functionality of buckets as tools. Zoo Biol 31: 260-266, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Variation in anthropoid vertebral formulae: implications for homology and homoplasy in hominoid evolution,"['Williams, SA']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,10.1002/jezb.21451,MAR 2012,11,"Variation in vertebral formulae within and among hominoid species has complicated our understanding of hominoid vertebral evolution. Here, variation is quantified using diversity and similarity indices derived from population genetics. These indices allow for testing models of hominoid vertebral evolution that call for disparate amounts of homoplasy, and by inference, different patterns of evolution. Results are interpreted in light of short-backed (J Exp Zool (Mol Dev Evol) 302B:241267) and long-backed (J Exp Zool (Mol Dev Evol) 314B:123134) ancestries proposed in different models of hominin vertebral evolution. Under the long-back model, we should expect reduced variation in vertebral formulae associated with adaptively driven homoplasy (independently and repeatedly reduced lumbar regions) and the relatively strong directional selection presumably associated with it, especially in closely related taxa that diverged relatively recently (e.g., Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus). Instead, high amounts of intraspecific variation are observed among all hominoids except humans and eastern gorillas, taxa that have likely experienced strong stabilizing selection on vertebral formulae associated with locomotor and habitat specializations. Furthermore, analyses of interspecific similarity support an evolutionary scenario in which the vertebral formulae observed in western gorillas and chimpanzees represent a reasonable approximation of the ancestral condition for great apes and humans, from which eastern gorillas, humans, and bonobos derived their unique vertebral profiles. Therefore, these results support the short-back model and are compatible with a scenario of homology of reduced lumbar regions in hominoid primates. Fossil hominin vertebral columns are discussed and shown to support, rather than contradict, the short-back model. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 318:134147, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Schum.) Lin.) in Mgahinga Gorilla National Park (Virunga Volcanoes), Uganda. Local people lost legal access to bamboo when the park was gazetted in 1991 - but still request harvesting rights. Bamboo sprouts provide a key food for conservation significant Mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) and African golden monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis kandti). We examined the impact of a localised harvest of mature bamboo on the production of new stems. We used a grid of 540 variable area plots to record and assess 9420 stems (including 1268 cut stems) and 1981 sprouts. Mean densities were 3.96 stems m(-2) and 0.68 sprouts m(-2). Densities and diameters were lower in areas with tree shade compared to those without. Densities of new stems were positively related to densities of older stems. Diameters of young stems were positively correlated with the diameters of older stems but younger stems were, in general, significantly larger. Cutting of mature stems had no detectable impact on either the density or diameter of subsequent new stems. Statistical power analysis adapted from pharmaceutical assessments indicates that a minor positive or negative impact remains possible (a positive effect appears more probable). We conclude that the bamboo is in a ""building phase"", that densities and sizes of young stems are determined by the extent of the underground rhizome, and that this plot-scale relationship is not detectably influenced by harvesting older stems. Nonetheless, negative impacts may arise with repeated harvesting. Guidelines for any future harvest are suggested. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Adrenal androgen production in catarrhine primates and the evolution of adrenarche,"['Bernstein, RM', 'Sterner, KN', 'Wildman, DE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22001,MAR 2012,12,"Adrenarche is a developmental event involving differentiation of the adrenal gland and production of adrenal androgens, and has been hypothesized to play a role in the extension of the preadolescent phase of human ontogeny. It remains unclear whether any nonhuman primate species shows a similar suite of endocrine, biochemical, and morphological changes as are encompassed by human adrenarche. Here, we report serum concentrations of the adrenal androgens dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) measured in 698 cross-sectional and mixed longitudinal serum samples from catarrhine primates ranging from 0.6 to 47 years of age. DHEAS in Pan is most similar to that of humans in both age-related pattern and absolute levels, and a transient early increase appears to be present in Gorilla. DHEA levels are highest in Cercocebus, Cercopithecus, and Macaca. We also tested for evidence of adaptive evolution in six genes that code for proteins involved in DHEA/S synthesis. Our genetic analyses demonstrate the protein-coding regions of these genes are highly conserved among sampled primates. We describe a tandem gene duplication event probably mediated by a retrotransposon that resulted in two 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta 5-Delta 4 genes (HSD3B1 and HSD3B2) with tissue specific functions in catarrhines. In humans, HSD3B2 is expressed primarily in the adrenals, ovary, and testis, while HSD3B1 is expressed in the placenta. Taken together, our findings suggest that while adrenarche has been suggested to be unique to hominoids, the evolutionary roots for this developmental stage are more ancient.

Although the position of the middle cervical ganglion (MG) in the great apes tended to be relatively lower than that in humans, the morphology of the ECNP in adult great apes was almost consistent with that in adult humans but essentially different from that in the lesser apes or gibbons. Therefore, the well-argued anatomical question of when did the MG acquire communicating branches with the spinal cervical nerves and appear constantly in all sympathetic cardiac nerves during primate evolution is clearly considered to be after the great apes and gibbons split. Moreover, a horizontal four-chambered heart and a lifted cardiac apex with a relatively large volume in newborn great apes rapidly changed its position downward, as seen in humans during postnatal growth and was associated with a reduction in the hepatic volume by imaging diagnosis and gross anatomy. In addition, our observation using a range of postnatal stages exhibits that two sympathetic ganglia, the middle cervical and cervicothoracic ganglia, differed between the early and later postnatal stages.

The periodicities all of the 15 teeth were 9 d. Comparisons of periodicity were made with extant primates, fossil apes and hominins. Periodicity of fossil Pongo from South China was relatively long but fell within the variation of extant Pongo, Gorilla and modern human, and longer than periodicity of Pan and other extant primates. Fossil Pongo from South China was similar to Lufengpithecus and Sivapithecus, shorter than Gigantopithecus and longer than European and African fossil apes and most early hominins in periodicity. Generally, the periodicities of Asian large-body fossil apes were longer than the periodicities of European and African large-body fossil apes in Miocene. Difference among species and trend of evolution in periodicity were analyzed and discussed. We found that periodicity might gradually increase from Proconsul in early Miocene to several fossil apes in Miocene and then Gigantopithecus in Pleistocene. In addition, this study made correlate analysis between periodicity and body mass respectively in males and females of six extant apes and five fossil apes, and found that periodicity positively correlated with body mass."
Transmission of Infectious Diseases En Route to Habitat Hotspots,"['Benavides, J', 'Walsh, PD', 'Meyers, LA', 'Raymond, M', 'Caillaud, D']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0031290,FEB 20 2012,1,"Background: The spread of infectious diseases in wildlife populations is influenced by patterns of between-host contacts. Habitat ""hotspots'' - places attracting a large numbers of individuals or social groups - can significantly alter contact patterns and, hence, disease propagation. Research on the importance of habitat hotspots in wildlife epidemiology has primarily focused on how inter-individual contacts occurring at the hotspot itself increase disease transmission. However, in territorial animals, epidemiologically important contacts may primarily occur as animals cross through territories of conspecifics en route to habitat hotspots. So far, the phenomenon has received little attention. Here, we investigate the importance of these contacts in the case where infectious individuals keep visiting the hotspots and in the case where these individuals are not able to travel to the hotspot any more.

Methodology and Principal Findings: We developed a simulation epidemiological model to investigate both cases in a scenario when transmission at the hotspot does not occur. We find that (i) hotspots still exacerbate epidemics, (ii) when infectious individuals do not travel to the hotspot, the most vulnerable individuals are those residing at intermediate distances from the hotspot rather than nearby, and (iii) the epidemiological vulnerability of a population is the highest when the number of hotspots is intermediate.

Conclusions and Significance: By altering animal movements in their vicinity, habitat hotspots can thus strongly increase the spread of infectious diseases, even when disease transmission does not occur at the hotspot itself. Interestingly, when animals only visit the nearest hotspot, creating additional artificial hotspots, rather than reducing their number, may be an efficient disease control measure."

In long-lived species, accurate estimations of demographic parameters are difficult to obtain, and therefore assessment of reintroduction success in such species is challenging. To assess the initial success of a reintroduction program for the long-lived, slow-reproducing, and critically endangered western lowland gorilla Gorilla gorilla gorilla, we analyzed postrelease monitoring data from 2 reintroduced populations, in the Bateke Plateau region of the Republics of Congo and Gabon, to quantify several demographic parameters, and compared our results with published data on wild gorilla populations. Annual survival rate of the 51 released gorillas was 97.4%, 9 females gave birth to 11 infants at an annual birth rate of 0.196 births per adult female, and first-year survival of the infants was 81.8%. Annual birth rate within the reintroduced populations is not significantly different from that given for wild western gorilla populations, and other demographic parameters fall within the range of published data for wild gorilla populations. Our analysis illustrates that the reintroduction program has been successful in terms of the initial measures of postrelease survival and reproduction, and our quantitative data should facilitate the development of a population model that can predict the probability of population persistence and therefore provide an indication of longer-term reintroduction success."
What Role Do Mothers Play in the Gestural Acquisition of Bonobos (Pan paniscus) and Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)?,"['Schneider, C', 'Call, J', 'Liebal, K']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-011-9570-3,FEB 2012,1,"Contemporary research hypothesizes that biological inheritance and ontogenetic factors shape the development of gestural communication in nonhuman great apes. However, little is known about the specific role that mothers play in the acquisition of their infants' gestures. We observed 6 bonobo (Pan paniscus) and 4 chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) mother-infant dyads and recorded their gesture types and frequency. We analyzed all behavioral contexts in which gestures occurred as well as the play context alone. Infants of both species were unlikely to share gestures with their mother or unrelated adult females. However, gestural sharing was prevalent within age groups. Within and across species, infant-infant and mother-mother groups were homogeneous regarding the types of gestures they shared, although there was individual variation in the frequency of gesture use. Our findings provide limited evidence that infants learned their gestures by imitating their mothers. Phylogenetic influences seem to be vital in gestural acquisition but, we suggest, repertoire development cannot be disentangled from individual social encounters during life."

We measured fermentation parameters in fecal samples of 4 hindgut fermenting species (Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Papio hamadryas, Cercopithecus neglectus) and 1 foregut fermenting species (Colobus guereza) to determine whether differences in SCFA profiles exist between the 2 digestive systems. We analyzed SCFA profiles, culture pH, and methane from fecal samples collected at the North Carolina Zoological Park. Results indicate that the captive individuals exhibit high total SCFA concentrations, with a particularly high acetate-to-propionate ratio. Methane levels were highest in the 2 ape species, and lowest in Colobus guereza and Cercopithecus neglectus. Total SCFA concentrations were similar between wild and captive-born Gorilla gorilla, although concentrations of acetate were significantly greater -and butyrate concentration and methane production significantly lower- in wild-caught gorillas relative to captive-born. These results are consistent with data on diet and digestive retention times among Catarrhini and have implications for our understanding of the interactions among diet, body mass, digestion, and how monogastric cercopithecines can consume either similar or greater levels of fiber than larger-bodied apes."
Assessing inactivity in zoo gorillas using keeper ratings and behavioral data,"['Less, EH', 'Kuhar, CW', 'Dennis, PM', 'Lukas, KE']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2012.01.001,FEB 2012,1,"One way to address the problem of small sample size in zoo research is to conduct a study involving multiple institutions. However, when conducting behavioral research, it can be difficult for one investigator to travel to each institution or for staff at individual institutions to find time to collect behavioral data. This study validates keeper assessments of western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) activity levels against behavioral data collected systematically in the zoo setting. Our purpose in validating a keeper rating of inactivity was to increase efficiency of behavioral data collection and maximize the amount of activity information for a larger study on gorilla health and behavior. A questionnaire was sent to 15 Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) institutions housing 63 gorillas (37 male, 26 female) gorillas. Behavioral data for the project were collected by staff at each institution and/or by the principal invesitgator (PI) using group scan sampling. Every data collector was reliability tested by video until they gained >90% agreement with the PI. Mean percent of time spent in a behavior was calculated from the scan data. In this case, the focus was on the time spent immobile (i.e., stationary) and time spent idle (i.e., at rest, performing no otherwise defined active behaviors). We examined the correlation between the keepers' ratings and time spent immobile and idle as calculated from the behavioral data. Behavioral data on individuals that spent more time immobile were significantly correlated with an increasingly inactive ranking by staff (P = 0.003). Time spent idle was significantly correlated with time spent immobile (P = 0.001) and time spent idle was also significantly correlated with an increasingly inactive ranking by staff (P < 0.001). This study demonstrates that keeper ratings of activity can be an accurate method to glean information on gorilla behavior in zoos when the more ideal mode of behavioral data collection cannot be used. Because this method is a simple way to collect data, it can increase sample size and facilitate multi-institutional studies. However, a keeper rating should always be validated with behavioral data before used as a replacement form of data collection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We analyse several constraints and design features, and show how they relate both to biological organisms, and to lessons that can be learned from building artificial systems.

Apes often perform poorly in the task whereas many other species succeed. One popular explanation for this finding is that apes have not evolved the propensity to understand others' communicative behaviour because their social systems are based predominantly on competitive relationships. We caution against this hypothesis by highlighting recent experimental evidence that suggests methodological factors are responsible for the apes' poor performance in object-choice studies. Furthermore, we compared the methodology and results of 63 published object-choice studies in a range of animal taxa. We found that the central object-choice method that is only used with apes and other primates typically results in failure. When, however, modifications are made to this method or apes are tested with a peripheral method that is similar to the one used with many other species, their performance vastly improves. We discuss the significance of this in relation to past object-choice research and make several recommendations as to how future research can be improved upon so that apes are tested in a manner comparable to the testing of other animal species.

"Limb preferences in a marsupial, Macropus rufogriseus: evidence for postural effect","['Giljov, A', 'Karenina, K', 'Malashichev, Y']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.11.031,FEB 2012,7,"In many primate species, bipedal stance is a factor increasing manual laterality. To understand this phenomenon better, there is a need to investigate forelimb preferences in nonprimate mammals with bipedal locomotion as the preferred gait, such as bipedal hopping marsupials. We studied laterality in forelimb use in 27 adult red-necked wallabies during their usual daily activity in five zoos. During feeding from the bipedal position adult wallabies displayed group-level left-forelimb preference with the majority of individuals being lateralized. However, no lateralization was found at the group level during feeding from the quadrupedal position, with only a few animals expressing individual preferences. Wallabies showed significant group-level bias while using the right forelimb for supporting the body in the tripedal stance, with nearly half the individuals being lateralized. On a smaller sample of nine wallabies forelimb preferences in unimanual snout autogrooming were studied: seven individuals preferred to use their left forelimb and two displayed no preference. Additionally, we studied asymmetrical limb use during milk suckling in six young-at-foot wallabies. Here, all subjects more often pulled down the mother's pouch edge with the left forelimb and simultaneously supported the body with the right paw. Our results show that marsupials can display motor laterality at both individual and group levels, comparable with those observed in placentals. Moreover, in red-necked wallabies, much as in primates, the bipedal posture favours the expression of manual laterality, while its direction depends on the functional nature of the motor action. Evolutionary scenarios such as the postural origin theory of behavioural lateralization are discussed. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Park Gazettement and Integrated Conservation and Development as Factors in Community Conflict at Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda","['Baker, J', 'Milner-Gulland, EJ', 'Leader-Williams, N']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01777.x,FEB 2012,6,"Conflicts between protected-area managers and local people are common, but the drivers of conflict are rarely analyzed. This limits opportunities to identify strategies that reduce conflict and the magnitude of resulting threats to conservation. Integrated conservation and development (ICD) was adopted at Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda, to reduce conflict during gazettement of the national park, but the success of this approach remains contested. We retrieved documents of conflict written by park staff and local people from 1986 through 2000 (before, during, and after gazettement). We extracted data on 48 incidences of violent conflict and categorized them by gazettement period, area, instigator, and type to undertake a historical analysis of the triggers of violent conflict at Bwindi. Before and during gazettement, local villagers instigated most of the conflict incidents when law-enforcement efforts sought to halt commercial activities within Bwindi. No conflict arose from the arrest of villagers collecting subsistence resources during these periods. After gazettement, prohibitions on commercial activities continued to drive conflict even though villagers collecting subsistence resources were arrested more frequently than before gazettement, and local attitudes toward the park had improved following receipt of ICD benefits. Law-enforcement efforts targeted commercial activities to reduce this threat to Bwindi's mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), although the activities remained important income sources for people in villages near Bwindi. Losing commercial income following gazettement therefore appeared to be their primary motivation for instigating conflict with park rangers. Prohibitions on subsistence resource use triggered conflict less often. Our use of typologies for a multivariate conflict analysis demonstrates that by identifying differences between effects of conservation as drivers of conflict, conflict analysis can enable a more strategic deployment of conflictresolution measures that could further conservation efforts. At Bwindi targeting ICD toward individuals who lost benefits from commercial activities may strengthen the role of ICD in conflict resolution and conservation."
Onset and early use of gestural communication in nonhuman great apes,"['Schneider, C', 'Call, J', 'Liebal, K']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.21011,FEB 2012,3,"The early gesturing of six bonobos, eight chimpanzees, three gorillas, and eight orangutans was systematically documented using focal animal sampling. Apes' were observed during their first 20 months of life in an effort to investigate: (i) the onset of gesturing; (ii) the order in which signals of different sensory modalities appear; (iii) the extent to which infants make use of these modalities in their early signaling; and (iv) the behavioral contexts where signals are employed. Orangutans differed in important gestural characteristics to African ape species. Most notably, they showed the latest gestural onset and were more likely to use their early signals in food-related interactions. Tactile and visual signals appeared similarly early across all four species. In African apes, however, visual signaling gained prominence over time while tactile signaling decreased. These findings suggest that motor ability, which encourages independence from caregivers, is an important antecedent, among others, in gestural onset and development, a finding which warrants further investigation."
"Diet of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda, 2. temporal variation and fallback foods","['Watts, DP', 'Potts, KB', 'Lwanga, JS', 'Mitani, JC']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.21015,FEB 2012,10,"Highly frugivorous primates like chimpanzees (Pan trogolodytes) must contend with temporal variation in food abundance and quality by tracking fruit crops and relying more on alternative foods, some of them fallbacks, when fruit is scarce. We used behavioral data from 122 months between 1995 and 2009 plus 12 years of phenology records to investigate temporal dietary variation and use of fallback foods by chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. Fruit, including figs, comprised most of the diet. Fruit and fig availability varied seasonally, but the exact timing of fruit production and the amount of fruit produced varied extensively from year to year, both overall and within and among species. Feeding time devoted to all major fruit and fig species was positively associated with availability, reinforcing the argument that chimpanzees are ripe fruit specialists. Feeding time devoted to figsparticularly Ficus mucuso (the top food)varied inversely with the abundance of nonfig fruits and with foraging effort devoted to such fruit. However, figs contributed much of the diet for most of the year and are best seen as staples available most of the time and eaten in proportion to availability. Leaves also contributed much of the diet and served as fallbacks when nonfig fruits were scarce. In contrast to the nearby Kanywara study site in Kibale, pith and stems contributed little of the diet and were not fallbacks. Fruit seasons (periods of at least 2 months when nonfig fruits account for at least 40% of feeding time; Gilby & Wrangham., Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 61:17711779, 2007) were more common at Ngogo than Kanyawara, consistent with an earlier report that fruit availability varies less at Ngogo [Chapman et al., African Journal of Ecology 35:287302, 1997]. F. mucuso is absent at Kanyawara; its high density at Ngogo, combined with lower variation in fruit availability, probably helps to explain why chimpanzee population density is much higher at Ngogo."
Facilitating Play Through Communication: Significance of Teeth Exposure in the Gorilla Play Face,"['Waller, BM', 'Cherry, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.21018,FEB 2012,5,"Primate facial expressions (FEs) likely play an important role in primate society: through facial signals, individuals can potentially send and receive information and may benefit from coordinating their behavior accordingly. Many primates use a relaxed open mouth (ROM) facial display or play face (PF) during play behavior, where the mouth is open but teeth are covered. In addition to this conventional PF, however, Western Lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) also use a full PF where the upper teeth are exposed. As the teeth are similarly exposed in the bared-teeth expression (which is a signal of appeasement, submission and/or affiliation), the full PF may be a blend of the PF and bared-teeth face, and have a different signal function to the PF alone. Focal animal sampling of captive Western Lowland gorillas (N = 10) showed that the full PF was more often observed in intense rather than gentle play, and intense play bouts that featured the full PF were longer than those that featured only the PF. Both expressions were associated with an increase in affinitive behavior between sender and receiver postplay, but only the full PF was associated with an increase higher than that of play alone. Overall, the findings suggest that the full PF has an additional role in coordinating and maintaining play, possibly though reducing uncertainty in the receiver and confirming that play is only play."

The evolution of social philopatry and dispersal in female mammals,"['Clutton-Brock, TH', 'Lukas, D']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05232.x,FEB 2012,51,"In most social mammals, some females disperse from their natal group while others remain and breed there throughout their lives but, in a few, females typically disperse after adolescence and few individuals remain and breed in their natal group. These contrasts in philopatry and dispersal have an important consequence on the kinship structure of groups which, in turn, affects forms of social relationships between females. As yet, there is still widespread disagreement over the reasons for the evolution of habitual female dispersal, partly as a result of contrasting definitions of dispersal. This paper reviews variation in the frequency with which females leave their natal group or range (social dispersal) and argues that both the avoidance of local competition for resources and breeding opportunities and the need to find unrelated partners play an important role in contrasts between and within species."
"Unusual feeding behavior in wild great apes, a window to understand origins of self-medication in humans: Role of sociality and physiology on learning process","['Masi, S', 'Gustafsson, E', 'Saint Jalme, M', 'Narat, V', 'Todd, A', 'Bomsel, MC', 'Krief, S']",PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR,10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.08.012,JAN 18 2012,10,"Certain toxic plants are beneficial for health if small amounts are ingested infrequently and in a specific context of illness. Among our closest living relatives, chimpanzees are found to consume plants with pharmacological properties. Providing insight on the origins of human self-medication, this study investigates the role social systems and physiology (namely gut specialization) play on learning mechanisms involved in the consumption of unusual and potentially bioactive foods by two great ape species. We collected data from a community of 41-44 wild chimpanzees in Uganda (11 months, 2008), and a group of 11-13 wild western gorillas in Central African Republic (10 months, 2008-2009). During feeding, we recorded food consumed, its availability, and social interactions (including observers watching conspecifics and the observers' subsequent activity). Unusual food consumption in chimpanzees was twice higher than in gorillas. Additionally chimpanzees relied more on social information with vertical knowledge transmission on unusual foods by continually acquiring information during their life through mostly observing the fittest (pre-senescent) adults. In contrast, in gorillas observational learning primarily occurred between related immatures, showing instead the importance of horizontal knowledge transmission. As chimpanzees' guts are physiologically less specialized than gorillas (more capable of detoxifying harmful compounds), unusual-food consumption may be more risky for chimpanzees and linked to reasons other than nutrition (like self-medication). Our results show that differences in sociality and physiology between the two species may influence mechanisms that discriminate between plants for nutrition and plants with potential therapeutic dietary components. We conclude that self-medication may have appeared in our ancestors in association with high social tolerance and lack of herbivorous gut specialization. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
The neural and cognitive correlates of aimed throwing in chimpanzees: a magnetic resonance image and behavioural study on a unique form of social tool use,"['Hopkins, WD', 'Russell, JL', 'Schaeffer, JA']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2011.0195,JAN 12 2012,10,"It has been hypothesized that neurological adaptations associated with evolutionary selection for throwing may have served as a precursor for the emergence of language and speech in early hominins. Although there are reports of individual differences in aimed throwing in wild and captive apes, to date there has not been a single study that has examined the potential neuroanatomical correlates of this very unique tool-use behaviour in non-human primates. In this study, we examined whether differences in the ratio of white (WM) to grey matter (GM) were evident in the homologue to Broca's area as well as the motor-hand area of the precentral gyrus (termed the KNOB) in chimpanzees that reliably throw compared with those that do not. We found that the proportion of WM in Broca's homologue and the KNOB was significantly higher in subjects that reliably throw compared with those that do not. We further found that asymmetries in WM within both brain regions were larger in the hemisphere contralateral to the chimpanzee's preferred throwing hand. We also found that chimpanzees that reliably throw show significantly better communication abilities than chimpanzees that do not. These results suggest that chimpanzees that have learned to throw have developed greater cortical connectivity between primary motor cortex and the Broca's area homologue. It is suggested that during hominin evolution, after the split between the lines leading to chimpanzees and humans, there was intense selection on increased motor skills associated with throwing and that this potentially formed the foundation for left hemisphere specialization associated with language and speech found in modern humans."
The origins of non-human primates' manual gestures,"['Liebal, K', 'Call, J']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2011.0044,JAN 12 2012,23,"The increasing body of research into human and non-human primates' gestural communication reflects the interest in a comparative approach to human communication, particularly possible scenarios of language evolution. One of the central challenges of this field of research is to identify appropriate criteria to differentiate a gesture from other non-communicative actions. After an introduction to the criteria currently used to define non-human primates' gestures and an overview of ongoing research, we discuss different pathways of how manual actions are transformed into manual gestures in both phylogeny and ontogeny. Currently, the relationship between actions and gestures is not only investigated on a behavioural, but also on a neural level. Here, we focus on recent evidence concerning the differential laterality of manual actions and gestures in apes in the framework of a functional asymmetry of the brain for both hand use and language."
"A word in the hand: action, gesture and mental representation in humans and non-human primates","['Cartmill, EA', 'Beilock, S', 'Goldin-Meadow, S']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2011.0162,JAN 12 2012,26,"The movements we make with our hands both reflect our mental processes and help to shape them. Our actions and gestures can affect our mental representations of actions and objects. In this paper, we explore the relationship between action, gesture and thought in both humans and non-human primates and discuss its role in the evolution of language. Human gesture (specifically representational gesture) may provide a unique link between action and mental representation. It is kinaesthetically close to action and is, at the same time, symbolic. Non-human primates use gesture frequently to communicate, and do so flexibly. However, their gestures mainly resemble incomplete actions and lack the representational elements that characterize much of human gesture. Differences in the mirror neuron system provide a potential explanation for non-human primates' lack of representational gestures; the monkey mirror system does not respond to representational gestures, while the human system does. In humans, gesture grounds mental representation in action, but there is no evidence for this link in other primates. We argue that gesture played an important role in the transition to symbolic thought and language in human evolution, following a cognitive leap that allowed gesture to incorporate representational elements."

Insofar as they face common threats, diverse species may benefit from the same conservation intervention, thereby offering efficiencies in conservation action. We explore this proposition for primates and felids by examining coarse scale overlaps in geographical distributions, using IUCN Red List assessments of the primary threats posed to each species. A global analysis of primates and felids that face common threats reveals the greatest overlap is in Central and South Asia, where up to 14 primates and felids co-occur. More than 80% of the land where at least 1 threatened species of either primate or felid occurs also contains at least one threatened species of the other taxon, yet over 60% of these grid cells containing both threatened primates and felids lie outside Conservation International's hot spots. A review of IUCN Action Plans of the threats to felids and primates strongly supports the hypothesis that they are often the same and occur in the same place. In principle, steps to conserve big cats have the potential to benefit several species of threatened primates, and vice versa. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel"

More field data are needed to further elucidate the behavioural modifications of apes in response to predation.

Mangrove and Peat Swamp Forests: Refuge Habitats for Primates and Felids,"['Nowak, K']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000339810,2012,1,"Swamp forests may be important refuges for primates and felids where these taxa are threatened with habitat loss. Mangrove and peat swamp forests, impenetrable, wet habitats, inaccessible and uninhabitable for humans, may, in some regions, be the most significant remaining habitats for threatened species. They are nevertheless neglected in field studies compared to relatively species-rich, terrestrial tropical forests probably, in part, because of the difficulties associated with surveying them. As a result, maps of mammal distributions may overlook swamp forests although camera-trapping is gradually rectifying this gap. I have compiled and mapped records of over 60 primate and 20 felid taxa reported to use mangrove and peat swamp forests in Africa and Asia at 47 sites, of which 21 are Afrotropical mangrove, 25 are Indo-Malayan mangrove or peat swamp forest, and 1 is an outlying mangrove site in Japan.

Reconstructing the Demographic History of the Human Lineage Using Whole-Genome Sequences from Human and Three Great Apes,"['Hara, Y', 'Imanishi, T', 'Satta, Y']",GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/gbe/evs075,2012,10,"The demographic history of human would provide helpful information for identifying the evolutionary events that shaped the humanity but remains controversial even in the genomic era. To settle the controversies, we inferred the speciation times (T) and ancestral population sizes (N) in the lineage leading to human and great apes based on whole-genome alignment. A coalescence simulation determined the sizes of alignment blocks and intervals between them required to obtain recombination-free blocks with a high frequency. This simulation revealed that the size of the block strongly affects the parameter inference, indicating that recombination is an important factor for achieving optimum parameter inference. From the whole genome alignments (1.9 giga-bases) of human (H), chimpanzee (C), gorilla (G), and orangutan, 100-bp alignment blocks separated by >= 5-kb intervals were sampled and subjected to estimate tau=mu T and theta = 4 mu gN using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, where mu is the mutation rate and g is the generation time. Although the estimated tau(HC) differed across chromosomes, tau(HC) and tau(HCG) were strongly correlated across chromosomes, indicating that variation in tau is subject to variation in mu, rather than T, and thus, all chromosomes share a single speciation time. Subsequently, we estimated Ts of the human lineage from chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan to be 6.0-7.6, 7.6-9.7, and 15-19 Ma, respectively, assuming variable mu across lineages and chromosomes. These speciation times were consistent with the fossil records. We conclude that the speciation times in our recombination-free analysis would be conclusive and the speciation between human and chimpanzee was a single event."
A Bayesian Method for Estimating Evolutionary History,"['Kim, J', 'Anthony, NM', 'Larget, BR']",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA732,2012,2,"Phylogeography is the study of evolutionary history among populations in a species associated with geographic genetic variation. This paper examines the phylogeography of three African gorilla subspecies based on two types of DNA sequence data. One type is HV1, the first hyper-variable region in the control region of the mitochondrial genome. The other type is nuclear mitochondrial DNA (Numt DNA), which results from the introgression of a copy of HV1 from the mitochondrial genome into the nuclear genome. Numt and HV1 sequences evolve independently when in different organelles, but they share a common evolutionary history at the same locus in the mitochondrial genome prior to introgression. This study estimates the evolutionary history of gorilla populations in terms of population divergence times and effective population sizes. Also, this study estimates the number of introgression events. The estimates are obtained in a Bayesian framework using novel Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The method is based on a hybrid coalescent process that combines separate coalescent processes for HV1 and Numt sequences along with a transfer model for introgression events within a single population tree. This Bayesian method for the analysis of Numt and HV1 sequences is the first approach specifically designed to model the evolutionary history of homologous multi-locus sequences within a population tree framework. The data analysis reveals highly discordant estimates of the divergence time between eastern and western gorilla populations for HV1 and Numt sequences. The discordant east-west split times are evidence of male-mediated gene flow between east and west long after female gorillas stopped this migration. In addition, the analysis estimates multiple independent introgression events."
A comparison of two home range modeling methods using Ugandan mountain gorilla data,"['Scull, P', 'Palmer, M', 'Frey, F', 'Kraly, E']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,10.1080/13658816.2012.691507,2012,3,"Home range is the area over which animals traverse in the course of their normal daily activities. Home range measures are essential to understanding a species' behavioral ecology and can be critical information for biological conservation. In the realm of mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) management at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, home range is typically calculated using the minimum convex polygon (MCP) approach. However, geographic information system has enabled more robust measures of home range to be calculated from field data. In order to assess the potential utility of a new home range modeling method, local convex hull (LoCoH), we compared LoCoH home ranges with those derived from MCP for several different gorilla groups. First, we evaluated the sensitivity of each method to outliers. Second, we compared the size of yearly home ranges for groups with distinctively different ranging behavior. Third, we compared the proportion of yearly home range found outside the park for two different groups. As anticipated, we found that LoCoH ranges are smaller (similar to 50%) than MCP ranges, but contrary to expectation our data show that MCP is not more sensitive to outliers than LoCoH. Our comparison also illustrates that the two methods result in different proportions of home range found outside the park; overall, MCP had a tendency to underestimate relative to LoCoH. Our results illustrate the importance of selecting an appropriate home range model for the spatial pattern of the data being modeled, the environment and context where the data were collected, and the motivation of the research. Overall, we found LoCoH to be a more effective home range modeling method for mountain gorilla conservation management."

This has led many to view them as ""primitive"" and to presume that their behavior and anatomy are also primitive. If true, they could serve as models of our last common ancestor (LCA), i.e., a territorially aggressive knuckle walker, reliant on vertical climbing and below-branch suspension to access the high canopy as a ripe-fruit frugivore. Ardipithecus now provides abundant information that the LCA differed substantially from chimpanzees (as well as bonobos and gorillas), both anatomically and behaviorally, and exhibited many characters that are more similar to those of modern humans than to any living ape. This major extension of the hominoid fossil record contravenes strict referential modeling based on the extant chimpanzee and greatly improves our ability to reconstruct the LCA more accurately, but only when viewed within the broader context of evolutionary ecology."
Accessing the Impenetrable: The Nature and Distribution of Tourism Benefits at a Ugandan National Park,"['Sandbrook, C', 'Adams, WM']",SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES,10.1080/08941920.2011.644394,2012,7,"Nature-based tourism is widely considered a conservation strategy because it can provide benefits for local people and thereby increase support for conservation and contribute to development. However, concerns have been raised over the uneven distribution of benefits. Here we use access analysis to investigate the distribution of tourism benefits at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, and the underlying factors constraining access to benefits. We introduce two new categories of engagement in tourism: active (for example through employment) and passive (for example through revenue sharing). Benefits from active engagement were often monetary, and access to them was often tightly constrained. In contrast, benefits from passive engagement were often nonmonetary and were more widely accessible. By analyzing together multiple active and passive pathways to tourism engagement, the study reveals that tourism benefits in some form can reach a wide range of local people, even where access to individual pathways is tightly constrained."
The primacy of fact perception,"['Schiller, AA']",PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1080/09515089.2011.622437,2012,0,"After outlining an enactive account of fact perception, I consider J. L. Austin's discussion of the argument from illusion. From it I draw the conclusion that when fact perception is primary the objects perceived are those involved in the fact. A consideration of Adelson's checkershadow illusion shows that properties as basic as luminance are perceived in the contexts of facts as well. I thus conclude that when facts are perceived they structure our perception of objects and properties. I then argue that which facts are perceived is determined by contexts which are themselves determined by our interests. Here I appeal to Heidegger's views on everyday coping as a foundational form of intentional directedness. A discussion of Simons and Chabris' gorilla experiment provides contemporary empirical support of the Heideggerian analysis. Finally, I argue that there cannot be context-free perception on the enactive account inasmuch as perception, qua action, is always permeated with the interests of the subject."
Aversion to violation of expectations of food distribution: the role of social tolerance and relative dominance in seven primate species,"['Amici, F', 'Call, J', 'Aureli, F']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/156853912X637833,2012,6,"Studies on how animals behave when two partners receive different amounts of food have produced variable results, with individuals responding negatively to specific food distributions in some cases (e.g., when food is distributed unequally between partners), but not in others. In this study, we used a simple experimental approach to (i) assess the strictness of dominance relationships based on the degree of social tolerance and (ii) compare the behavioural responses of seven primate species (chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes; bonobos, Pan paniscus; gorillas, Gorilla gorilla; orangutans, Pan go pygmaeus; brown capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella; spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi; long-tailed macaques, Macaca fascicularis), when two partners received different amounts of food and no effort was required. We predicted that negative responses (i.e., refusal to participate in the task or avoidance of proximity to the food source) would be elicited by food distributions that violate the individual expectations based on tolerance levels and subject's dominance rank relative to the partner. In the 'tolerance' task, we found that species with less strict dominance relationships were chimpanzees and bonobos, followed by orangutans, spider monkeys, gorillas, brown capuchin monkeys and long-tailed macaques. In the 'food distribution' task, capuchin monkeys and especially macaques showed their aversion by refusing to participate in most conditions, including the ones with equal food distribution. When dominants received more food than the partner, subjects of all species maintained a comparable amount of proximity to the food source,"

A combination of computational data mining and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to validate the data is an excellent method for conducting comparative genomics. Thus, designing primers for PCR is an essential procedure for a comparative analysis of primate genomes. Here, we developed and introduced UniPrimer for use in those studies. UniPrimer is a web-based tool that designs PCR- and DNA-sequencing primers. It compares the sequences from six different primates (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, and rhesus macaque) and designs primers on the conserved region across species. UniPrimer is linked to RepeatMasker, Primer3Plus, and OligoCalc softwares to produce primers with high accuracy and UCSC In-Silico PCR to confirm whether the designed primers work. To test the performance of UniPrimer, we designed primers on sample sequences using UniPrimer and manually designed primers for the same sequences. The comparison of the two processes showed that UniPrimer was more effective than manual work in terms of saving time and reducing errors."

"Tourism revenue sharing policy at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda: a policy arrangements approach","['Ahebwa, WM', 'van der Duim, R', 'Sandbrook, C']",JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM,10.1080/09669582.2011.622768,2012,8,"Debates on how to deliver conservation benefits to communities living close to protected high-biodiversity areas have preoccupied conservationists for over 20 years. Tourism revenue sharing (TRS) has become a widespread policy intervention in Africa and elsewhere where charismatic populations of wildlife remain. This paper analyzes TRS policy at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda, from a policy arrangements perspective. It is based on data collected at BINP and three surrounding parishes, using qualitative methods. It concludes that the governance capacity of the TRS policy arrangement at BINP is low due to the structural incongruence of the dimensions of the policy arrangement (analyzed in terms of actors, resources, rules of the game and discourses). Despite the participatory rhetoric of policy reforms, the Uganda Wildlife Authority remains the most powerful actor: it has control over resources and consequently determines the rules of the game. Local communities do not feel adequately compensated for conservation costs. This issue is exacerbated by weak communications with local people, problems of fair distribution locally and nationally, corruption claims and powerful local elites. To maximize TRS' ability to contribute to conservation through development, inequities in the design of the TRS and dispersion of benefits need to be addressed."

Is caching the key to exclusion in corvids? The case of carrion crows (Corvus corone corone),"['Mikolasch, S', 'Kotrschal, K', 'Schloegl, C']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0434-1,JAN 2012,17,"Recently, two corvid species, food-caching ravens and non-caching jackdaws, have been tested in an exclusion performance (EP) task. While the ravens chose by exclusion, the jackdaws did not. Thus, foraging behaviour may affect EP abilities. To investigate this possibility, another food-caching corvid species, the carrion crow (Corvus corone corone), was tested in the same exclusion task. We hid food under one of two cups and subsequently lifted either both cups, or the baited or the un-baited cup. The crows were significantly above chance when both cups were lifted or when only the baited cup was lifted. When the empty cup was lifted, we found considerable inter-individual variation, with some birds having a significant preference for the un-baited but manipulated cup. In a follow-up task, we always provided the birds with the full information about the food location, but manipulated in which order they saw the hiding or the removal of food. Interestingly, they strongly preferred the cup which was manipulated last, even if it did not contain any food. Therefore, we repeated the first experiment but controlled for the movement of the cups. In this case, more crows found the food reliably in the un-baited condition. We conclude that carrion crows are able to choose by exclusion, but local enhancement has a strong influence on their performance and may overshadow potential inferential abilities. However, these findings support the hypothesis that caching might be a key to exclusion in corvids."

Patterns of integration can offer important insight into the structural relationship between phenotypic units, providing a framework to address questions about phenotypic evolvability and constraints. Integrative features of the primate cranium have recently become a popular subject of study. However, an important question that still remains under-investigated is: what is the pattern of cranial shape integration among closely related hominoids? To address this question, we conducted a Procrustes-based geometric morphometrics study to quantify and analyze shape covariation patterns between different cranial regions in Homo, Pan, Gorilla and Pongo. A total of fifty-six 3D landmarks were collected on 407 adult individuals. We then sub-divided the landmarks corresponding to cranial units as outlined in the 'functional matrix hypothesis.' Sub-dividing the cranium in this manner allowed us to explore patterns of covariation between the face, basicranium and cranial vault, using the two-block partial least squares approach. Our results suggest that integrated shape changes in the hominoid cranium are complex, but that the overall pattern of integration is similar among human and non-human apes. Thus, despite having very distinct morphologies the way in which the face, basicranium and cranial vault covary is shared among these taxa. These results imply that the pattern of cranial integration among hominoids is conserved. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Extensive diversity of intestinal trichomonads of non-human primates,"['Smejkalova, P', 'Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Pomajbikova, K', 'Modry, D', 'Cepicka, I']",PARASITOLOGY,10.1017/S0031182011001624,JAN 2012,7,"Despite the fact that the non-human primates are our closest relatives and represent a species-rich mammalian group, little is known about their intestinal protistan parasites/commensals. Particularly, the intestinal trichomonads represent a neglected part of the fauna of the primate digestive system. We have established 30 trichomonad strains isolated from feces of 11 primate species kept in 3 Czech zoos and performed an analysis of their SSU rDNA and ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2. Our results showed that intestinal trichomonads are rather common among non-human primates. Molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that the strains are unexpectedly diversified, belonging to 8 or 9 distinct species. Interestingly, the vast majority of the strains from non-human primates belonged to the genus Tetratrichomonas while no member of this genus has been found in the human intestine so far. In addition, hominoid and non-hominoid primates differed in their intestinal trichomonads. Our results suggest that captive primates possibly may be infected by intestinal trichomonads of other vertebrates such as pigs, cattle, birds, tortoises and lizards."

It is therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee; and as these two species are now man's nearest allies, it is somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere.1 Although this quote is frequently recalled today, Darwin's next line is rarely acknowledged: But it is useless to speculate on this subject, for an ape nearly as large as a man, namely the Dryopithecus of Lartet, which was closely allied to the anthropomorphous Hylobates, existed in Europe during the Upper Miocene period; and since so remote a period the earth has certainly undergone many great revolutions, and there has been ample time for migration on the largest scale.1"

Anti-SFV antibodies were found in 31 of 286 plasma samples (10.5%). The integrase gene sequence was found in 38/497 samples, including both blood and tissue samples, with novel SFVs in several Cercopithecus species. Of the 78 humans, mostly hunters, who had been bitten or scratched by NHPs, 19 were SFV seropositive, with 15 cases confirmed by PCR. All but one were infected with ape SFV. We thus found novel SFV strains in NHPs in Gabon and high cross-species transmission of SFVs from gorilla bites."
Visual detection based distance sampling offers efficient density estimation for distinctive low abundance tropical forest tree species in complex terrain,"['Kissa, DO', 'Sheil, D']",FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,10.1016/j.foreco.2011.09.020,JAN 1 2012,5,"Good density estimates for low abundance tree species are costly to achieve especially in rugged or disturbed forest landscapes. More efficient methods would be of considerable value to managers and conservationists. Here we assess a method that has been neglected in this context. We examine and compare distance-based visual detection line-transects and conventional fixed-width transects for assessing a distinctive low abundance species of conservation significance, Myrianthus holstii Engl., in three separate areas, within a steep, disturbed mountain rain forest. Precision and implied accuracy appeared substantially better with the visual detection line-transect than with the fixed-width transect for equivalent costs and effort at all three landscapes but as the two methods provide different estimates there are questions of possible bias in both approaches. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the distance approach and suggest some recommendations concerning its application. We conclude that the distance method is suited to low density species that are easily identified, even when understorey vegetation and terrain severely impair visibility. However, due to the differences in detection probabilities, populations need to be stratified both by tree size and context. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Functional adaptations in the forelimb muscles of non-human great apes,"['Myatt, JP', 'Crompton, RH', 'Payne-Davis, RC', 'Vereecke, EE', 'Isler, K', 'Savage, R', ""D'Aout, K"", 'Gunther, MM', 'Thorpe, SKS']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2011.01443.x,JAN 2012,10,"The maximum capability of a muscle can be estimated from simple measurements of muscle architecture such as muscle belly mass, fascicle length and physiological cross-sectional area. While the hindlimb anatomy of the non-human apes has been studied in some detail, a comparative study of the forelimb architecture across a number of species has never been undertaken. Here we present data from chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and an orangutan to ascertain if, and where, there are functional differences relating to their different locomotor repertoires and habitat usage. We employed a combination of analyses including allometric scaling and ancovas to explore the data, as the sample size was relatively small and heterogeneous (specimens of different sizes, ages and sex). Overall, subject to possible unidentified, confounding factors such as age effects, it appears that the non-human great apes in this sample (the largest assembled to date) do not vary greatly across different muscle architecture parameters, even though they perform different locomotor behaviours at different frequencies. Therefore, it currently appears that the time spent performing a particular behaviour does not necessarily impose a dominating selective influence on the soft-tissue portion of the musculoskeletal system; rather, the overall consistency of muscle architectural properties both between and within the Asian and African apes strengthens the case for the hypothesis of a possible ancient shared evolutionary origin for orthogrady under compressive and/or suspensory loading in the great apes."
The leukemia associated nuclear corepressor ETO homologue genes MTG16 and MTGR1 are regulated differently in hematopoietic cells,"['Ajore, R', 'Kumar, P', 'Dhanda, RS', 'Gullberg, U', 'Olsson, I']",BMC MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,10.1186/1471-2199-13-11,MAR 23 2012,1,"Background: MTG16, MTGR1 and ETO are nuclear transcriptional corepressors of the human ETO protein family. MTG16 is implicated in hematopoietic development and in controlling erythropoiesis/megakaryopoiesis. Furthermore, ETO homologue genes are 3'participants in leukemia fusions generated by chromosomal translocations responsible of hematopoietic dysregulation. We tried to identify structural and functional promoter elements of MTG16 and MTGR1 genes in order to find associations between their regulation and hematopoiesis.

Results: 5' deletion examinations and luciferase reporter gene studies indicated that a 492 bp sequence upstream of the transcription start site is essential for transcriptional activity by the MTG16 promoter. The TATA-and CCAAT-less promoter with a GC box close to the start site showed strong reporter activity when examined in erythroid/megakaryocytic cells. Mutation of an evolutionary conserved GATA -301 consensus binding site repressed promoter function. Furthermore, results from in vitro antibody-enhanced electrophoretic mobility shift assay and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated binding of GATA-1 to the GATA -301 site. A role of GATA-1 was also supported by transfection of small interfering RNA, which diminished MTG16 expression. Furthermore, expression of the transcription factor HERP2, which represses GATA-1, produced strong inhibition of the MTG16 promoter reporter consistent with a role of GATA-1 in transcriptional activation. The TATA-less and CCAAT-less MTGR1 promoter retained most of the transcriptional activity within a -308 to -207 bp region with a GC-box-rich sequence containing multiple SP1 binding sites reminiscent of a housekeeping gene with constitutive expression. However, mutations of individual SP1 binding sites did not repress promoter function; multiple active SP1 binding sites may be required to safeguard constitutive MTGR1 transcriptional activity. The observed repression of MTG16/MTGR1 promoters by the leukemia associated AML1-ETO fusion gene may have a role in hematopoietic dysfunction of leukemia.

Conclusions: An evolutionary conserved GATA binding site is critical in transcriptional regulation of the MTG16 promoter. In contrast, the MTGR1 gene depends on a GC-box-rich sequence for transcriptional regulation and possible ubiquitous expression. Our results demonstrate that the ETO homologue promoters are regulated differently consistent with hematopoietic cell-type-specific expression and function."

Mosquitoes as potential bridge vectors of malaria parasites from non-human primates to humans,"['Verhulst, NO', 'Smallegange, RC', 'Takken, W']",FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY,10.3389/fphys.2012.00197,2012,6,"Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites which are transmitted by mosquitoes. Until recently, human malaria was considered to be caused by human-specific Plasmodium species. Studies on Plasmodium parasites in non-human primates (NHPs), however, have identified parasite species in gorillas and chimpanzees that are closely related to human Plasmodium species. Moreover, P knowlesi, long known as a parasite of monkeys, frequently infects humans. The requirements for such a cross-species exchange and especially the role of mosquitoes in this process are discussed, as the latter may act as bridge vectors of Plasmodium species between different primates. Little is known about the mosquito species that would bite both humans and NHPs and if so, whether humans and NHPs share the same Plasmodium vectors. To understand the vector-host interactions that can lead to an increased Plasmodium transmission between species, studies are required that reveal the nature of these interactions. Studying the potential role of NHPs as a Plasmodium reservoir for humans will contribute to the ongoing efforts of human malaria elimination, and will help to focus on critical areas that should be considered in achieving this goal."
"Molecular Anthropology and the Subversion of Paleoanthropology: an Example of ""the Emperor's Clothes"" Effect?","['Schwartz, JH']",HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF THE LIFE SCIENCES,NA,2012,0,"Although the birth of ""molecular systematics"" may date to the turn of the twentieth century, the discipline did not gain momentum until the 1960s, when most paleoanthropologists believed that humans were distantly related to a great ape group (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan), within which the African apes were most closely related. From the beginning, interpretation of molecular data, initially protein immunoreactivity, conflicted with the interpretation of morphological data by favoring a human-African ape or even a human-chimpanzee relationship. As interpretations of protein sequences, DNA hybridization, and ultimately mitochondrial (mt) and nuclear (n) DNA sequences increasingly yielded a human-chimpanzee relationship, virtually all paleoanthropologists came to embrace this relationship not only as possible, but even as fact. This led to a general disparaging of morphology as being phylogenetically revealing which, in turn, sent paleoanthropologists scurrying to identify any anatomical feature or system that supported the molecular systematists' claims. The perennial problems were and remain that humans and chimpanzees share few potentially synapomorphic features and most fossils are known only from morphology. In exploring these problems, I summarize the history of morphologically and then, molecularly-based theories of human-ape relationship. I hope to make clear how this history contributed in human evolutionary studies to the subservience of paleoanthropology to molecular anthropology."

Recent studies in wild-living apes in Africa have revealed that P.falciparum, the most deadly form of human malaria, is not only human-host restricted as previously believed and its phylogenetic lineage is much more complex with new species identified in gorilla, bonobo and chimpanzee. Although less impressive, new data on biology of P.malariae, P.ovale and P.vivax are also emerging and will be briefly discussed in this review."

The extent to which such modifications accumulate over time is largely unknown but could potentially be used to differentiate between endogenous old DNA and present-day DNA contaminating specimens and experiments. Here we examine mitochondrial DNA sequences from tissue remains that vary in age between 18 and 60,000 years with respect to three molecular features: fragment length, base composition at strand breaks, and apparent C to T substitutions. We find that fragment length does not decrease consistently over time and that strand breaks occur preferentially before purine residues by what may be at least two different molecular mechanisms that are not yet understood. In contrast, the frequency of apparent C to T substitutions towards the 5'-ends of molecules tends to increase over time. These nucleotide misincorporations are thus a useful tool to distinguish recent from ancient DNA sources in specimens that have not been subjected to unusual or harsh treatments."

Robert finds his true self through his death caused by tuberculosis and Yank, also, through his death caught in a Gorilla's cage. Ultimately, their death is not only an evident tragic affair in appearance, but becomes a release from the alienation and the suffering of life, a blessing, and a perfection of finding true self and eternal belonging in reality."
Production Technology and Method of Rig System for Facial Capture of Digital Creatures - Focusing on Facial Capture of Digital Gorilla in <Mr. Go>,"['최철영', '최규돈']",The Korean Journal of animation,NA,2012,0,"Not only in filmmaking but in animation field, there is a growing need for facial capture that makes facial expressions of digital character actors including creatures apply to computer graphics (CG) characters. Apart from simply making the necessary facial expressions, their unique expressions containing actors’ emotion can be reflected to the CG characters or creatures. However the related attempts in Korea haven’t been made enough because facial capture requires more than just buying necessary equipment and applying. For example, if you need to apply an actor’s facial expression to a digital creature such as a man, a bear or a gorilla, certain technologies are required to be developed to draw the optimal result regarding different types of oral structures and muscle placement. This paper is intended to provide direction towards applications in facial capture of various forms of digital creature by showing process of overcoming the limitations of facial capture device and developing RIG system for facial capture suitable for the skeleton and muscle of a digital creature-in gorilla’s face. At this point of time when it gets blur the distinction between CG and reality, not between film and animation, due to the active performance of realistic digital actors and digital creatures, we expect to be able to go with the stream of producing global contents by proposing application technology, particularly RIG system development for realistic facial capture technology development and proposed applications such as content creation to flow through the world them among."

We extend our earlier comparative investigation to include an analysis of the intraspecific variation of these genes in gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), and examine the resulting patterns in the light of the species' markedly different social and mating behaviors.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis (FISH) of DAZ and CDY in 12 Y-chromosomal lineages of western lowland gorilla (G. gorilla gorilla) and a single lineage of the eastern lowland gorilla (G. beringei graueri) showed no variation among lineages.

We validated the contrasting DAZ and CDY patterns using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in chimpanzee and bonobo.

Conclusion/Significance: High intraspecific variation in copy number and position of the DAZ and CDY genes is seen only in the chimpanzee. We hypothesize that this is best explained by sperm competition that results in the variant DAZ and CDY haplotypes detected in this species. In contrast, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans-species that are not subject to sperm competition-showed no intraspecific variation in DAZ and CDY suggesting that monoandry in gorillas, and preferential female mate choice in bonobos and orangutans, probably permitted the fixation of a single Y variant in each taxon. These data support the notion that the evolutionary history of a primate Y chromosome is not simply encrypted in its DNA sequences, but is also shaped by the social and behavioral circumstances under which the specific species has evolved."
Nutritional geometry: gorillas prioritize non-protein energy while consuming surplus protein,"['Rothman, JM', 'Raubenheimer, D', 'Chapman, CA']",BIOLOGY LETTERS,10.1098/rsbl.2011.0321,DEC 23 2011,47,"It is widely assumed that terrestrial food webs are built on a nitrogen-limited base and consequently herbivores must compensate through selection of high-protein foods and efficient nitrogen retention. Like many folivorous primates, gorillas' diet selection supports this assumption, as they apparently prefer protein-rich foods. Our study of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) in Uganda revealed that, in some periods, carbohydrate-rich fruits displace a large portion of protein-rich leaves in their diet. We show that non-protein energy (NPE) intake was invariant throughout the year, whereas protein intake was substantially higher when leaves were the major portion of the diet. This pattern of macronutrient intake suggests that gorillas prioritize NPE and, to achieve this when leaves are the major dietary item, they over-eat protein. The concentrations of protein consumed in relation to energy when leaves were the major portion of the diet were close to the maximum recommended for humans and similar to high-protein human weight-loss diets. By contrast, the concentrations of protein in relation to energy when gorillas ate fruit-dominated diets were similar to those recommended for humans. Our results question the generality of nitrogen limitation in terrestrial herbivores and provide a fascinating contrast with human macronutrient intake."
Consequences of Non-Intervention for Infectious Disease in African Great Apes,"['Ryan, SJ', 'Walsh, PD']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0029030,DEC 22 2011,26,"Infectious disease has recently joined poaching and habitat loss as a major threat to African apes. Both ""naturally"" occurring pathogens, such as Ebola and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), and respiratory pathogens transmitted from humans, have been confirmed as important sources of mortality in wild gorillas and chimpanzees. While awareness of the threat has increased, interventions such as vaccination and treatment remain controversial. Here we explore both the risk of disease to African apes, and the status of potential responses. Through synthesis of published data, we summarize prior disease impact on African apes. We then use a simple demographic model to illustrate the resilience of a well-known gorilla population to disease, modeled on prior documented outbreaks. We found that the predicted recovery time for this specific gorilla population from a single outbreak ranged from 5 years for a low mortality (4%) respiratory outbreak, to 131 years for an Ebola outbreak that killed 96% of the population. This shows that mortality rates comparable to those recently reported for disease outbreaks in wild populations are not sustainable. This is particularly troubling given the rising pathogen risk created by increasing habituation of wild apes for tourism, and the growth of human populations surrounding protected areas. We assess potential future disease spillover risk in terms of vaccination rates amongst humans that may come into contact with wild apes, and the availability of vaccines against potentially threatening diseases. We discuss and evaluate non-interventionist responses such as limiting tourist access to apes, community health programs, and safety, logistic, and cost issues that constrain the potential of vaccination."
Great Apes' Risk-Taking Strategies in a Decision Making Task,"['Haun, DBM', 'Nawroth, C', 'Call, J']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0028801,DEC 21 2011,21,"We investigate decision-making behaviour in all four non-human great ape species. Apes chose between a safe and a risky option across trials of varying expected values. All species chose the safe option more often with decreasing probability of success. While all species were risk-seeking, orangutans and chimpanzees chose the risky option more often than gorillas and bonobos. Hence all four species' preferences were ordered in a manner consistent with normative dictates of expected value, but varied predictably in their willingness to take risks."
"HIV-1 Group P is unable to antagonize human tetherin by Vpu, Env or Nef","['Sauter, D', 'Hue, S', 'Petit, SJ', 'Plantier, JC', 'Towers, GJ', 'Kirchhoff, F', 'Gupta, RK']",RETROVIROLOGY,10.1186/1742-4690-8-103,DEC 15 2011,32,"Background: A new subgroup of HIV-1, designated Group P, was recently detected in two unrelated patients of Cameroonian origin. HIV-1 Group P phylogenetically clusters with SIVgor suggesting that it is the result of a crossspecies transmission from gorillas. Until today, HIV-1 Group P has only been detected in two patients, and its degree of adaptation to the human host is largely unknown. Previous data have shown that pandemic HIV-1 Group M, but not non-pandemic Group O or rare Group N viruses, efficiently antagonize the human orthologue of the restriction factor tetherin (BST-2, HM1.24, CD317) suggesting that primate lentiviruses may have to gain antitetherin activity for efficient spread in the human population. Thus far, three SIV/ HIV gene products (vpu, nef and env) are known to have the potential to counteract primate tetherin proteins, often in a species-specific manner. Here, we examined how long Group P may have been circulating in humans and determined its capability to antagonize human tetherin as an indicator of adaptation to humans.

Results: Our data suggest that HIV-1 Group P entered the human population between 1845 and 1989. Vpu, Env and Nef proteins from both Group P viruses failed to counteract human or gorilla tetherin to promote efficient release of HIV-1 virions, although both Group P Nef proteins moderately downmodulated gorilla tetherin from the cell surface. Notably, Vpu, Env and Nef alleles from the two HIV-1 P strains were all able to reduce CD4 cell surface expression.

Conclusions: Our analyses of the two reported HIV-1 Group P viruses suggest that zoonosis occurred in the last 170 years and further support that pandemic HIV-1 Group M strains are better adapted to humans than nonpandemic or rare Group O, N and P viruses. The inability to antagonize human tetherin may potentially explain the limited spread of HIV-1 Group P in the human population."

Allelic Lineages of the Ficolin Genes (FCNs) Are Passed from Ancestral to Descendant Primates,"['Hummelshoj, T', 'Nissen, J', 'Munthe-Fog, L', 'Koch, C', 'Bertelsen, MF', 'Garred, P']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0028187,DEC 15 2011,2,"The ficolins recognize carbohydrates and acetylated compounds on microorganisms and dying host cells and are able to activate the lectin pathway of the complement system. In humans, three ficolin genes have been identified: FCN1, FCN2 and FCN3, which encode ficolin-1, ficolin-2 and ficolin-3, respectively. Rodents have only two ficolins designated ficolin-A and ficolin-B that are closely related to human ficolin-1, while the rodent FCN3 orthologue is a pseudogene. Ficolin-2 and ficolin-3 have so far only been observed in humans. Thus, we performed a systematic investigation of the FCN genes in non-human primates. The exons and intron-exon boundaries of the FCN1-3 genes were sequenced in the following primate species: chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, rhesus macaque, cynomolgus macaque, baboon and common marmoset. We found that the exon organisation of the FCN genes was very similar between all the non-human primates and the human FCN genes. Several variations in the FCN genes were found in more than one primate specie suggesting that they were carried from one species to another including humans. The amino acid diversity of the ficolins among human and non-human primate species was estimated by calculating the Shannon entropy revealing that all three proteins are generally highly conserved. Ficolin-1 and ficolin-2 showed the highest diversity, whereas ficolin-3 was more conserved. Ficolin-2 and ficolin-3 were present in non-human primate sera with the same characteristic oligomeric structures as seen in human serum. Taken together all the FCN genes show the same characteristics in lower and higher primates. The existence of trans-species polymorphisms suggests that different FCN allelic lineages may be passed from ancestral to descendant species."
The visual strategy specific to humans among hominids: A study using the gap-overlap paradigm,"['Kano, F', 'Hirata, S', 'Call, J', 'Tomonaga, M']",VISION RESEARCH,10.1016/j.visres.2011.09.006,DEC 8 2011,11,"Although an extensive body of literature exists on the cognitive underpinnings of gaze movements in macaques and humans, few studies have investigated this topic from a broader evolutionary perspective. This study used the gap-overlap paradigm to examine the timing of the gaze movements by four hominid species: humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The saccade latency involved in shifting the gaze from central to peripheral stimuli was measured and compared under two conditions, gap and overlap. The central stimulus disappeared shortly before the onset of the peripheral stimulus under the gap condition, but it remained under the overlap condition. Although all species demonstrated similar saccade latencies under the gap condition, the species clearly differed from one another under the overlap condition, which may suggest their similar perceptual and motor mechanism of making a saccade on the one hand and their differential strategies for coping with the competition between two activities involving fixation and initiation of a saccade (i.e. central vs. peripheral visual stimuli) on the other hand. In particular, humans showed longer saccade latency under the overlap condition compared to the other great apes, which may reflect this species' unique means of visual processing.

A Revised Timeline for the Origin of Plasmodium falciparum as a Human Pathogen,"['Baron, JM', 'Higgins, JM', 'Dzik, WH']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-011-9476-x,DEC 2011,7,"While Plasmodium falciparum is known to have had a strong effect on human evolution, the time period when P. falciparum first infected ancestors of modern humans has remained uncertain. Recent advances demonstrated that P. falciparum evolved from ancestors of gorilla parasites via host switching. Here, we estimate the range of dates during which this host switch may have occurred. DNA sequences of portions of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene obtained from gorilla parasites closely related to human P. falciparum were aligned and compared against similar sequences from human P. falciparum. Time estimates were calculated by applying a previously established parasite cytochrome b gene mutation rate (0.012 mutations per site per million years) and by modeling uncertainty in a Monte-Carlo simulation. We estimate a 95% confidence interval for when P. falciparum first infected ancestors of modern humans to be 112,000 and 1,036,000 years ago (median estimate, 365,000 years ago). This confidence interval suggests that P. falciparum first infected human ancestors much more recently than the previous recognized estimate of 2.5 million years ago. The revised estimate may inform our understanding of certain aspects of human-malaria co-evolution. For example, this revised date suggests a closer relationship between the entry of P. falciparum in humans and the appearance of many red blood cell polymorphisms considered to be genetic adaptations to malaria. In addition, the confidence interval lies within the timeframe dating the dawn of Homo sapiens, suggesting that P. falciparum may have undergone host switching as a Plasmodia adaptation specific for our species."
Identification of a Genomic Reservoir for New TRIM Genes in Primate Genomes,"['Han, K', 'Lou, DI', 'Sawyer, SL']",PLOS GENETICS,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002388,DEC 2011,36,"Tripartite Motif (TRIM) ubiquitin ligases act in the innate immune response against viruses. One of the best characterized members of this family, TRIM5 alpha, serves as a potent retroviral restriction factor with activity against HIV. Here, we characterize what are likely to be the youngest TRIM genes in the human genome. For instance, we have identified 11 TRIM genes that are specific to humans and African apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas) and another 7 that are human-specific. Many of these young genes have never been described, and their identification brings the total number of known human TRIM genes to approximately 100. These genes were acquired through segmental duplications, most of which originated from a single locus on chromosome 11. Another polymorphic duplication of this locus has resulted in these genes being copy number variable within the human population, with a Han Chinese woman identified as having 12 additional copies of these TRIM genes compared to other individuals screened in this study. Recently, this locus was annotated as one of 34 ""hotspot'' regions that are also copy number variable in the genomes of chimpanzees and rhesus macaques. Most of the young TRIM genes originating from this locus are expressed, spliced, and contain signatures of positive natural selection in regions known to determine virus recognition in TRIM5 alpha. However, we find that they do not restrict the same retroviruses as TRIM5 alpha, consistent with the high degree of divergence observed in the regions that control target specificity. We propose that this recombinationally volatile locus serves as a reservoir from which new TRIM genes arise through segmental duplication, allowing primates to continually acquire new antiviral genes that can be selected to target new and evolving pathogens."

ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS OF CAPTIVE WESTERN LOWLAND GORILLAS (GORILLA GORILLA GORILLA),"['Murphy, HW', 'Dennis, P', 'Devlin, W', 'Meehan, T', 'Kutinsky, I']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,DEC 2011,9,"A total of 163 echocardiographic studies on western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) were submitted for evaluation; 140 from 99 animals were suitable for analysis. Of these, 81 studies (42 studies from 35 males ranging in age from 11-41+ yr and 39 studies from 31 females ranging in age from 11-41+ yr) are reported here. Three studies from 3 females and 56 studies from 30 males were excluded from this report due to cardiac abnormalities. Cardiac parameters measured were aortic root (Ao Rt) diameter and left atrial (L atrium) size. Left ventricular (LV) measurements included left ventricular internal diameter in systole (LVID(s)) and diastole (LVID(d)) as well as diastolic septal (IVS) and posterior wall thickness (LVPW). Values considered to be normal in females >11 yr of age were: Ao Rt < 3.5 cm, L atrium < 4.0 cm, LVID(d) < 5.0 cm, IVS < 1.4 cm, LVPW < 1.4 cm, and ejection fraction (EF) >60%. The data from male gorillas show a separation in animals based on three cardiac parameters: systolic function, LV cavity size, and LV wall thickness. Male gorillas >11 yr of age fall into two groups; unaffected and affected. Unaffected animals are defined as those with no echocardiographic abnormalities and a consistent Ao Rt of <4.0 cm, LVID(d) of <6.0 cm, IVS and LVPW of <1.5 cm, and an EF of >58%. The affected group consisted of male gorillas that exhibited changes in echocardiographic parameters representing the presence of cardiovascular disease. The results determined in this database, gathered from data collected from 1999-2009, suggest a sex-based difference between males and females with predominantly males demonstrating evidence of cardiac disease. The most striking finding seen in this study is that of progressive LV hypertrophy and depressed LV EF in affected adult male gorillas."

To better understand the risk of disease in an endangered and scientifically important population of chimpanzees (Pan trogylodytes schweinfurthii), a health monitoring program was initiated in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. As part of this health monitoring program, comprehensive necropsies with histopathology were conducted on chimpanzees (n=11; 5 male, 6 female), ranging in age from fetal to 44 yr, that were found dead between August 2004 and January 2010. In contrast to previous reports, respiratory disease was not noted as a cause of morbidity or mortality. Trauma was the most common cause of death in these 11 chimpanzees. All of the chimpanzees greater than 1 yr of age had intestinal and mesenteric parasitic granulomas associated with true strongyles consistent with Oesophagostomum spp. The relative numbers of granulomas increased with age and, in some cases, may have been a cause of weight loss and diarrhea. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)cpz infection was documented in four deceased apes, all of whom exhibited varying amounts of lymphoid depletion including two females with marked CD4+ T cell loss consistent with end-stage SIVmac or human immunodeficiency virus infections. Myocardial megalokaryosis was common in chimpanzees greater than 1 mo of age; yet myocardial interstitial fibrosis, a common lesion in captive chimpanzees, was uncommon and only noted in two aged chimpanzees. These findings provide important information on causes of morbidity and mortality in wild chimpanzees, information that can be used to interpret findings during population declines and lead to better management of this population in the context of disease risk."
Review and Hypothesis: Does Graves' Disease Develop in Non-Human Great Apes?,"['McLachlan, SM', 'Alpi, K', 'Rapoport, B', 'SPONTANEOUS AUTOIMMUNE-THYROIDITIS']",THYROID,10.1089/thy.2011.0209,DEC 2011,6,"Background: Graves' disease, caused by stimulatory thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) autoantibodies, has not been observed in animals. In contrast, Hashimoto's thyroiditis develops in chickens, rats, mice, dogs, and marmosets. Attempts to induce an immune response in mice to the luteinizing-hormone receptor suggested that autoantigen glycosylation was one parameter involved in breaking self-tolerance. Over evolution, TSHR glycosylation increased from three asparagine-linked-glycans (N-glycans) in fish to six N-glycans in humans and great apes. All other placental mammals lack one N-glycan in the shed TSHR A-subunit, the primary Graves' disease autoantigen. We hypothesized that (a) lesser TSHR A-subunit glycosylation reduces immunogenicity, accounting for the absence of Graves' disease in most placental mammals; (b) due to human-like A-subunit glycosylation, Graves' disease might arise in great apes. Here, we review and analyze the literature on this subject and report the results of a survey of veterinarians at primate centers and zoos in North America.

Summary: Previous experimental data from induced TSHR antibodies in mice support a role for A-subunit glycosylation in breaking self-tolerance. An extensive search of the great-ape literature revealed five reports of noncongenital thyroid dysfunction, four with hypothyroidism and one with hyperthyroidism. The latter was a gorilla who was treated with anti-thyroid drugs but is now deceased. Neither serum nor thyroid tissue from this gorilla were available for analysis. The survey of veterinarians revealed that none of the 979 chimpanzees in primate research centers had a diagnosis of noncongenital thyroid dysfunction and among similar to 1100 great apes (gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees) in U. S. zoos, only three were hypothyroid, and none were hyperthyroid.

Conclusions: Graves' disease appears to be either very rare or does not occur in great apes based on the literature and a survey of veterinarians. Although the available data do not advance our hypothesis, there is a paucity of information regarding thyroid function tests and thyroid autoantibodies in the great apes In addition, these primates may be protected against TSHR autoimmunity by the absence of genetic polymorphisms and putative environmental triggers. Finally, larger numbers of great apes need to be followed, and tests of thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies be performed, to confirm that spontaneous Graves' disease is restricted to humans."
Lifetime Reproductive Success of Female Mountain Gorillas,"['Robbins, AM', 'Stoinski, T', 'Fawcett, K', 'Robbins, MM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21605,DEC 2011,13,"Studies of lifetime reproductive success (LRS) are important for understanding population dynamics and life history strategies, yet relatively little information is available for long-lived species. This study provides a preliminary assessment of LRS among female mountain gorillas in the Virunga volcanoes region. Adult females produced an average of 3.6 +/- 2.1 surviving offspring during their lifetime, which indicates a growing population that contrasts with most other great apes. The standardized variance in LRS (variance/mean(2) = 0.34) was lower than many other mammals and birds. When we excluded the most apparent source of environmental variability (poaching), the average LRS increased to 4.3 +/- 1.8 and the standardized variance dropped in half. Adult lifespan was a greater source of variance in LRS than fertility or offspring survival. Females with higher LRS had significantly longer adult lifespans and higher dominance ranks. Results for LRS were similar to another standard fitness measurement, the individually estimated finite rate of increase (kind), but kind showed diminishing benefits for greater longevity.

Nematode species, such as Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm), hookworms and Trichuris trichiura are shared by humans and other close phylogenetic primates (Pan and Gorilla), showing that they infected a common ancestor to this group. When humans migrated from Africa to other continents they carried these parasites wherever climate conditions allowed parasite transmission from host to host. Other parasites, however, were acquired throughout human biological and social evolutive history when new territories were occupied. Paleoparasitology data is a valuable source to recover emergence and disappearance of parasite infections through analysis of archaeological remains. Parasites can be used as biological markers of prehistoric human migrations. They are also indicators of diet, as parasite life cycles are related to specific kinds of food consumed by human groups in the different habitats they occupied. We review paleoparasitological findings in South America, comparing human-host and intestinal parasites with life conditions and environmental relationships through time."
Identification of a Novel Allosteric Binding Site in the CXCR2 Chemokine Receptor,"['de Kruijf, P', 'Lim, HD', 'Roumen, L', 'Renjaan, VA', 'Zhao, JQ', 'Webb, ML', 'Auld, DS', 'Wijkmans, JCHM', 'Zaman, GJR', 'Smit, MJ', 'de Graaf, C', 'Leurs, R']",MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY,10.1124/mol.111.073825,DEC 2011,16,"We have shown previously that different chemical classes of small-molecule antagonists of the human chemokine CXCR2 receptor interact with distinct binding sites of the receptor. Although an intracellular binding site for diarylurea CXCR2 antagonists, such as N-(2-bromophenyl)-N'-(7-cyano-1H-benzotriazol-4-yl) urea (SB265610), and thiazolopyrimidine compounds was recently mapped by mutagenesis studies, we now report on an imidazolylpyrimidine antagonist binding pocket in the transmembrane domain of CXCR2. Using different CXCR2 orthologs, chimeric proteins, site-directed mutagenesis, and in silico modeling, we have elucidated the binding mode of this antagonist. Our in silico-guided mutagenesis studies indicate that the ligand binding cavity for imidazolylpyrimidine compounds in CXCR2 is located between transmembrane (TM) helices 3 (Phe130(3.36)), 5 (Ser217(5.44), Phe220(5.47)), and 6 (Asn268(6.52), Leu271(6.55)) and suggest that these antagonists enter CXCR2 via the TM5-TM6 interface. It is noteworthy that the same interface is postulated as the ligand entry channel in the opsin receptor and is occupied by lipid molecules in the recently solved crystal structure of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, suggesting a general ligand entrance mechanism for nonpolar ligands to G protein-coupled receptors. The identification of a novel allosteric binding cavity in the TM domain of CXCR2, in addition to the previously identified intracellular binding site, shows the diversity in ligand recognition mechanisms by this receptor and offers new opportunities for the structure-based design of small allosteric modulators of CXCR2 in the future."
Leaky Registers and Eight-Hundred-Pound Gorillas,"['Irvine, JT']",ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY,10.1353/anq.2011.0011,WIN 2011,7,"Everywhere, there are topics and words that local conventions brand as ""unmentionable"" yet people manage to communicate about the unmentionable nevertheless. What are their strategies for doing so, and how well can those strategies work? This paper considers communicative means for mentioning or implicating the unmentionable, without actually breaching the norms that made the material noxious. Also considered are the larger cultural issues and social dramas that may be at stake.

Register shifts and footing shifts are common strategies for containing noxious material in a linguistic cordon sanitaire. So is conspicuous avoidance (of the gorilla in the room). But the public game of containment is only the most overt manifestation of the issues potentially concerned. Much mischief and many unforeseen entailments lurk in the shadows of these communicative efforts. The moral life of language resides in much larger arenas than the existing literature on ""verbal taboo"" and politeness generally envisions. Words not spoken, discourse contexts and histories, interlocutors' responses, genre conventions, local regimes of language, truth, and knowledge all these combine with the actual utterances, to multiple, often unforeseeable, effects."
Great ape cognition and captive care: Can cognitive challenges enhance well-being?,"['Clark, FE']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2011.10.010,NOV 30 2011,5,"Given the close genetic link between humans and nonhuman great apes, the well-being of the latter in captivity is understandably controversial. Behavioural signs of boredom, anxiety and stress in captive great apes have been linked to being reared in small groups or by humans, and by having a lack of control over the environment. This review proposes a new framework for great ape enrichment, inspired by a century of cognitive research. Problem-solving tasks that are designed so challenge the evolved cognitive skills of great apes might allow subjects to have more control in inherently restricted environments. These sorts of tasks have historically been used to test the comparative cognitive abilities of great apes housed in research facilities, with few parallel assessments of well-being. However, there is great potential for 'cognitive challenge' tasks to be applied to great apes in a range of captive settings for the enhancement of well-being. This is based on recent research on farmed animals, demonstrating that they may seek cognitive challenges and benefit from their own learning success. A new definition of 'cognitive enrichment' - where an appropriate cognitive challenge results in measurable beneficial changes to well-being - is proposed to encourage research at the interface of great ape cognition and well-being. Finally, two approaches to great ape cognitive enrichment - 'low-investment' and 'high-investment' - are proposed for future research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Application of the Diagnostic Evaluation for Alopecia in Traditional Veterinary Species to Laboratory Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta),"['Luchins, KR', 'Baker, KC', 'Gilbert, MH', 'Blanchard, JL', 'Liu, DX', 'Myers, L', 'Bohm, RP']",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE,NA,NOV 2011,4,"Alopecia in nonhuman primates in the biomedical research setting is often attributed to compromised psychologic wellbeing. Behavioral causes, mainly hair plucking, have become the unconfirmed and exclusive default diagnosis, and the possibility that alopecia may be secondary to a primary medical or dermatologic disease is often overlooked. Although nonbehavioral causes of alopecia in nonhuman primates are described in the literature, few prospective hypothesis-based studies have investigated medical and behavioral etiologies concurrently. We therefore undertook such a study with the aim of designing a clinical diagnostic guide for approaching cases of nonhuman primate alopecia. Because most cases of alopecia in nonhuman primates in the literature and at our facility are not associated with a definitive diagnosis, the hypothesis we tested was that the well-established diagnostic evaluation for alopecia used for traditional veterinary species is not applicable to nonhuman primates. Discounting differences in histopathology and behavioral assessment, the current study revealed few clinically relevant significant differences between nonhuman primates with and without alopecia. As a result, our hypothesis was confirmed, and we conclude that the standard dermatologic diagnostic plan typically described for alopecia diagnosis in traditional veterinary species and used as the basis for assessment of alopecia in nonhuman primates should be reassessed."

Their habitat, severely threatened by deforestation, contains a vast chemical and biological diversity. During the last decade, we have isolated and identified novel pharmacologically active compounds from plants used by wild chimpanzees in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Our continuous observations over the last 12 years confirm that chimpanzees, when sick, may ingest plant material that are not generally eaten, supporting the existence of self-medication among great apes. Knowledge of great-ape diseases, and the medicinal resources of tropical forests, may be improved by preserving and studying our closest relatives in their natural habitat."

The three Plasmodium species described in African great apes were very similar to those infecting humans. The most extensively studied was P reichenowi, because of its close phylogenetic relation to P falciparum, the predominant parasite in Africa and the most dangerous for humans. In the last three years, independent molecular studies of various chimpanzee and gorilla populations have revealed an unexpected diversity in the Plasmodium species they harbor, which are also phylogenetically close to P falciparum. In addition, cases of non human primate infection by human malaria parasites have been observed. These observations shed fresh light on the origin and evolutionary history of P falciparum and provide a unique opportunity to probe the biological specificities of this major human parasite."
Nematodes of the genus Oesophagostomum: an emerging risk for humans and apes in Africa?,"['Guillot, J', 'Vermeulen, B', 'Lafosse, S', 'Chauffour, S', 'Cibot, M', 'Narat, V', 'Masi, S', 'Nieguitsila, A', 'Snounou, G', 'Bain, O', 'Krief, S']",BULLETIN DE L ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MEDECINE,NA,NOV 2011,2,"Nematodes of the genus Oesophagostomum are common intestinal parasites found in cattle, pigs and primates. They can cause severe illness, resulting from the formation of granulomas, caseous lesions and abscesses in the intestinal wall. Human oesophagostomosis is endemic in northern Ghana and Togo. In these regions, epidemiological investigations have been conducted to determine the biological characteristics, transmission dynamics and optimal management of clinical cases. Nodular oesophagostomosis has also been described in free-ranging chimpanzees and gorillas. Clinical signs associated with nodules have been observed in great apes raised in sanctuaries, while the health status of their wild counterparts does not seem to be significantly affected. It has been suggested that some nonhuman primates may act as reservoirs for human oesophagostomosis. In Ghana, identification of genetic differences among Oesophagostomum nematodes infecting different primate hosts suggests that oesophagostomosis is a rare zoonosis. In Uganda, where the situation is different, cross-infection is probably more frequent."
Chimpanzee problem-solving: contrasting the use of causal and arbitrary cues,"['Hanus, D', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0421-6,NOV 2011,15,"Humans are able to benefit from a causally structured problem-solving context rather than arbitrarily structured situations. In order to better understand nonhuman causal cognition, it is therefore important to isolate crucial factors that might differentiate between events that follow a purely spatial and temporal contingency and those that hold a ""true"" causal relationship. In the first of two experiments, chimpanzee subjects were required to detect a bottle containing juice from five opaque bottles of equal shape and size. In the causal condition, the juice bottle looked identical to the other four bottles, only it was much heavier than the others. In the arbitrary condition, the weight of all five bottles was identical, but the juice bottle was color-marked differently. Since bottle opening was made difficult (and therefore costly), the question was whether subject's manipulative behavior would be random or somehow influenced by the nature of the provided information. Our results show that subjects detected and opened the juice bottle significantly faster when weight was the discriminating feature (causal condition) compared to situations in which the discrimination was necessarily based on a color-cue (arbitrary condition). Experiment 2 ruled out the possibility of a general learning bias toward tactile rather than visual information in chimpanzees. When tested in a simple exchange paradigm that prevented any use of causal information, no predominance of a tactile cue (weight) over a visual cue (color) could be found. Further-more-and in contrast to the causal condition in Experiment 1-no learning occurred during the course of Experiment 2, neither in the weight nor in the color condition. We therefore conclude that chimpanzees can more easily determine the content of an object based on its causal properties compared to situations in which the only available information is a pure arbitrary regularity. This supports the view that chimpanzees' causal cognition does not rely on mere perceptual information but also on structural abstraction about their physical environment."
Target animacy influences gorilla handedness,"['Forrester, GS', 'Leavens, DA', 'Quaresmini, C', 'Vallortigara, G']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0413-6,NOV 2011,25,"We investigated the unimanual actions of a biological family group of twelve western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) using a methodological approach designed to assess behavior within social context from a bottom-up perspective. Measures of both the lateralization of unimanual actions (left, right) and the target of the action (animate, inanimate) were assessed during dual, synchronized video observations of naturalistic behavior. This paper demonstrates a corelationship between handedness and the animate quality of the target object. Analyses demonstrated a significant interaction between lateralized unimanual actions and target animacy and a right-hand bias for actions directed toward inanimate targets. We suggest that lateralized motor preference reflects the different processing capabilities of the left and right hemispheres, as influenced by the emotive (animate) and/or functional (inanimate) characteristics of the target, respectively."
"Differences in gorilla nettle-feeding between captivity and the wild: local traditions, species typical behaviors or merely the result of nutritional deficiencies?","['Masi, S']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0457-7,NOV 2011,3,"Behavioral and cognitive studies on captive apes often pay little attention to the specific environmental conditions of their study subjects. A recent report form Byrne et al. (Anim Cogn doi:10.1007/s10071-011-0403-8, 2011), comparing nettle-feeding techniques between captive and wild gorillas, claimed to document ""the strongest evidence yet to come from any great ape that observational learning of a skilled conspecific"" can allow social learning and culture in gorillas. An earlier study with similar findings placed emphasis instead on the many similarities and claims for species typical behavior, thus a genetic hypothesis instead of a cultural hypothesis. This commentary aims at formulating a third environmental hypothesis based on path-dependent behavioral differences owing to different diet and availability of nutritional resources of wild and captive gorillas. Captive diet provides gorillas with a much lower concentration of fibers. Gorillas are hindgut fermenters, and this deficit of natural fermentation of fibers may impact their health and their behavior in zoos. Results of Byrne et al.'s study will be discussed comparing feeding choice and availability of nutritional resources of wild and captive gorillas, showing that in captivity gorilla, motivation to consume certain food or certain plant parts may differ drastically from that of wild gorillas. This view does not intend to deny that social learning and culture may exist in gorillas, but to guide and encourage future works investigating social learning in great apes to take more accurately into account the living conditions and, when comparing populations, the possible environmental differences."
"The Limits of Endowment Effects in Great Apes (Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus)","['Kanngiesser, P', 'Santos, LR', 'Hood, BM', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0024516,NOV 2011,7,"The endowment effect describes the bias that people often value things that they possess more than things they do not possess. Thus, they are often reluctant to trade items in their possession for items of equivalent value. Some nonhuman primates appear to share this bias with humans, but it remains an open question whether they show endowment effects to the same extent as humans do. We investigated endowment effects in all four great ape species (Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus) by varying whether apes were endowed with food items (Experiment 1, N = 22) or tools that were instrumental in retrieving food (Experiment 2, N = 23). We first assessed apes' preferences for items of a pair and their willingness to trade items in their possession. We then endowed apes with one item of a pair and offered them to trade for the other item. Apes showed endowment effects for food, but not for tools. In Experiment 3, we endowed bonobos (N = 4) and orangutans (N = 5) with either one or 12 food items. Endowment effects did not differ between species and were not influenced by the number of endowed food items. Our findings suggest that endowment effects in great apes are restricted to immediate food gratification and remain unaffected by the quantity of food rewards. However, endowment effects do not seem to extend to other, nonconsumable possessions even when they are instrumental in retrieving food. In general, apes do not show endowment effects across a range of different commodities as humans typically do."
EVIDENCE OF TERRESTRIAL DIETS IN PLIOCENE EURASIAN PAPIONINS (MAMMALIA: PRIMATES) INFERRED FROM LOW-MAGNIFICATION STEREOMICROSCOPY OF MOLAR ENAMEL USE-WEAR SCARS,"['Williams, FL', 'Holmes, NA', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFRICANUS']",PALAIOS,10.2110/palo.2010.p10-139r,NOV-DEC 2011,1,"Pliocene papionin monkeys of Eurasia, such as Paradolichopithecus arvernensis, Procynocephalus subhimalayanus, and Macaca sp. indet. from Yushe, are large-bodied and interpreted as at least partly terrestrial. Terrestriality in primates has implications for the dietary items consumed. Dietary proclivities from the evaluation of pit and scratch counts under low-magnification (35X) were inferred to address whether the diets of these Eurasian papionins differ and whether they correspond to extant primates (Papio ursinus, n = 24, Pan troglodytes, n = 9, and Gorilla gorilla, n = 10), three Plio-Pleistocene southern African fossil papionins with known isotopic values (Parapapio broomi, n = 14; Papio robinsoni, n = 10; Theropithecus oswaldi danieli, n = 8), or a Pliocene bipedal hominin (Australopithecus africanus, n = 8). Macaca sp. indet. from Yushe most closely resembles Australopithecus africanus from South Africa, which is characterized by evidence of some hard-object feeding. Paradolichopithecus from Romania and to a lesser extent Procynocephalus from northern India also exhibit use-wear scars associated with the ingestion of grit possibly associated with the exploitation of corms and bulbs of CAM or C(4) plants. The dental microwear signal of grassland foraging typical of such C(4) grazers as Theropithecus oswaldi danieli does not characterize other Plio-Pleistocene papionins. Pliocene papionin diets converge with those of Australopithecus, suggesting that global climate cooling intensifying during the Pliocene may have led both early baboon-like monkeys and australopiths to increase consumption of nutrient-rich edible plant storage organs in these fragmented and partially open habitats of the temperate Old World."
Postoccupancy evaluations in zoological settings,"['Kelling, AS', 'Gaalema, DE']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20398,NOV-DEC 2011,3,"A postoccupancy evaluation (POE) is a systematic assessment performed to examine the effectiveness of the built environment after occupation. Although POEs have been mainly used to examine the effectiveness of built environments for human usage, they can and should be adapted for use in zoological settings. Zoological exhibits have evolved from when hygiene concerns ruled design to current trends that involve elaborate exhibits that often cost millions of dollars. Thus, it is imperative to conduct evaluations to ensure that these exhibits function to meet the complex needs of all users. It is crucial to perform a comprehensive POE that focuses on all three user groups; animals, visitors, and staff. However, work in this field is limited. Animal research has tended to remain very primate-focused with differing opinions as to what constitutes optimal outcomes. Zoo visitor studies often have limited scope and differing methodologies. Additionally, research on zoo staff opinions and feedback is almost nonexistent. A new exhibit opening at a zoo has huge potential for improving the welfare of the animals it will house, enhancing the zoo visitor experience, and improving the workplace for zoo personnel. Building the best possible exhibits requires not only the analysis of how the built environment affects all three groups, but also dissemination of those findings to guide future design.

Two lineages, gorillas in Africa and orangutans in Asia, have sexual dimorphisms of super-sized males, though they presumably diverged from a smaller common ancestor. We test the hypothesis that they increased in body mass independently and convergently, and that their many postcranial differences reflect locomotor differences. Whole body dissections of five adult male gorillas and four adult male orangutans allowed quantification of body mass distribution to limb segments, of body composition (muscle, bone, skin, and fat relative to total body mass), and of muscle distribution and proportions. Results demonstrate that gorilla forelimb anatomy accommodates shoulder joint mobility for vertical climbing and reaching while maintaining joint stability during quadrupedal locomotion. The heavily muscled hind limbs are equipped for propulsion and weight-bearing over relatively stable substrates on the forest floor. In contrast, orangutan forelimb length, muscle mass, and joint construction are modified for strength and mobility in climbing, bridging, and traveling over flexible supports through the forest canopy. Muscles of hip, knee, and ankle joints provide rotational and prehensile strength essential for moving on unstable and discontinuous branches. We conclude that anatomical similarities are due to common ancestry and that differences in postcranial anatomy reflect powerful selection for divergent locomotor adaptations. These data further support the evolutionary conclusion that gorillas fall with chimpanzees and humans as part of the African hominoid radiation; orangutans are a specialized outlier.

Rates of extinction and endangerment of vertebrate species, for instance, have probably been reduced via conservation interventions. Such conservation actions operate at different spatial scales. Habitat preservation and endangered species recovery are examples of conservation successes at microscales. Mesoscale conservation includes regional cooperation among neighboring countries that has arrested population declines of endangered species, such as mountain gorillas. At macroscales, public pressure on multinational corporations has sometimes resulted in their abandoning environmentally damaging practices or suppliers with poor environmental records. Overall, conservation projects such as these need more long-term funding and greater political and popular support, and must also include provisions to evaluate and document their outcomes. As we discuss here, a focus on conservation successes achieved at different scales can help to promote these aims and guide future conservation victories."

It has been described in other primates, and it has been proposed that the species B. suis from pigs and B. struthionis from ostriches are synonyms of B. coli. Previous genetic analysis of pig and ostrich Balantidium isolates found a genetic polymorphism in the ITS region but its taxonomic relevance was not established. We have extended the genetic analysis to Balantidium isolates of pig, gorilla, human and ostrich origin. We have PCR-amplified and sequenced the ITS region of individual Balantidium cells. The predicted ITS secondary structures of the sequences obtained were transferred by homology modelling to the sequences of other Trichostomatia ciliates (Isotricha, Troglodytella, Lacrymaria and Spathidium) and compared to determine the importance of the differences in the primary sequences. The results show that the ITS2 secondary structure of the species considered follows the general pattern of other ciliates, although with some deviations. There are at least two main types of ITS sequence variants in B. coil which could be present in the same cell and they are common to the mammal and avian hosts studied. These data do not support B. suis and B. struthionis as distinct species. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier GmbH."
Modeling the biomechanics of articular eminence function in anthropoid primates,"['Terhune, CE']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2011.01424.x,NOV 2011,4,"One of the most prominent features of the cranial component of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the articular eminence (AE). This bar of bone is the primary surface upon which the condyle translates and rotates during movements of the mandible, and is therefore the primary point at which forces are transmitted from the mandible to the cranium during loading of the masticatory apparatus. The shape of the AE is highly variable across primates, and the raised eminence of humans has often been considered a defining feature of the human TMJ, yet few data exist to address whether this variation is functionally significant. This study used a broad interspecific sample of anthropoid primates to elaborate upon and test the predictions of a previously proposed model of AE function. This model suggests that AE inclination acts to resist non-normal forces at the TMJ, thereby maximizing bite forces (BFs). AE inclination was predicted to covary with two specific features of the masticatory apparatus: height of the TMJ above the occlusal plane; and inclination of the masticatory muscles. A correlate of this model is that taxa utilizing more resistant food objects should also exhibit relatively more inclined AEs. Results of the correlation analyses found that AE inclination is strongly correlated with height of the TMJ above the occlusal plane, but less so with inclination of the masticatory muscles. Furthermore, pairwise comparisons of closely related taxa with documented dietary differences found that the AE is consistently more inclined in taxa that utilize more resistant food items. These data preliminarily suggest that variation in AE morphology across anthropoid primates is functionally related to maximizing BFs, and add to the growing dataset of masticatory morphologies linked to feeding behavior."
New vertebral and rib material point to modern bauplan of the Nariokotome Homo erectus skeleton,"['Haeusler, M', 'Schiess, R', 'Boeni, T']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2011.07.004,NOV 2011,20,"The double S shape of the vertebral column is one of the most important evolutionary adaptations to human bipedal locomotion, providing an optimal compromise between stability and mobility. It is commonly believed that a six element long lumbar spine facilitated the critical adoption of lumbar lordosis in early hominins, which contrasts with five lumbars in modern humans and four in chimpanzees and gorillas. This is mainly based on the juvenile Homo erectus skeleton KNM-WT 15000 from Nariokotome, Kenya. Yet, the biomechanical advantage of a long lumbar spine is speculative. Here we present new vertebral and rib fragments of KNM-WT 15000. They demonstrate that the sixth to the last presacral vertebra possesses rib facets and therefore indicate the presence of only five lumbar and twelve thoracic segments, as is characteristic of modern humans. Moreover, they show that no additional element was located between the sixth to the last presacral vertebra and Th11 as suggested in the original description. The transition from thoracic to lumbar type orientation of the facet joints that takes place at Th11 is thus at the same segment as in over 40% of modern humans, suggesting an identical lumbar mobility and capacity for lordosis. Taken together, KNM-WT 15000 had one vertebra less than previously thought irrespective of whether rib-free lumbar vertebrae or vertebrae that bear lumbar-like articular processes are counted. Furthermore, the new rib fragments imply a rearrangement of the ribs that results in a symmetrical rib cage. This challenges previous claims for idiopathic or congenital scoliosis. We conclude that the bauplan of the hominin axial skeleton is more conservative than previously thought. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
The Ebola Virus Glycoprotein and HIV-1 Vpu Employ Different Strategies to Counteract the Antiviral Factor Tetherin,"['Kuhl, A', 'Banning, C', 'Marzi, A', 'Votteler, J', 'Steffen, I', 'Bertram, S', 'Glowacka, I', 'Konrad, A', 'Sturzl, M', 'Guo, JT', 'Schubert, U', 'Feldmann, H', 'Behrens, G', 'Schindler, M', 'Pohlmann, S']",JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES,10.1093/infdis/jir378,NOV 1 2011,29,"The antiviral protein tetherin/BST2/CD317/HM1.24 restricts cellular egress of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and of particles mimicking the Ebola virus (EBOV), a hemorrhagic fever virus.

We found that EBOV-GP but not Vpu counteracted tetherin from different primate species, indicating that EBOV-GP and Vpu target tetherin differentially. Tetherin interacted with the GP2 subunit of EBOV-GP, which might encode the determinants for tetherin counteraction. Vpu reduced cell surface expression of tetherin while EBOV-GP did not, suggesting that both proteins employ different mechanisms to counteract tetherin. Finally, Marburg virus (MARV)-GP also inhibited tetherin and downregulated tetherin in a cell type-dependent fashion, indicating that tetherin antagonism depends on the cellular source of tetherin. Collectively, our results indicate that EBOV-GP counteracts tetherin by a novel mechanism and that tetherin inhibition is conserved between EBOV-GP and MARV-GP."
Human Evolution and Osteoporosis-Related Spinal Fractures,"['Cotter, MM', 'Loomis, DA', 'Simpson, SW', 'Latimer, B', 'Hernandez, CJ']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0026658,OCT 19 2011,7,"The field of evolutionary medicine examines the possibility that some diseases are the result of trade-offs made in human evolution. Spinal fractures are the most common osteoporosis-related fracture in humans, but are not observed in apes, even in cases of severe osteopenia. In humans, the development of osteoporosis is influenced by peak bone mass and strength in early adulthood as well as age-related bone loss. Here, we examine the structural differences in the vertebral bodies (the portion of the vertebra most commonly involved in osteoporosis-related fractures) between humans and apes before age-related bone loss occurs. Vertebrae from young adult humans and chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons (T8 vertebrae, n = 8-14 per species, male and female, humans: 20-40 years of age) were examined to determine bone strength (using finite element models), bone morphology (external shape), and trabecular microarchitecture (micro-computed tomography). The vertebrae of young adult humans are not as strong as those from apes after accounting for body mass (p < 0.01). Human vertebrae are larger in size (volume, cross-sectional area, height) than in apes with a similar body mass. Young adult human vertebrae have significantly lower trabecular bone volume fraction (0.26 +/- 0.04 in humans and 0.37 +/- 0.07 in apes, mean +/- SD, p < 0.01) and thinner vertebral shells than apes (after accounting for body mass, p < 0.01). Since human vertebrae are more porous and weaker than those in apes in young adulthood (after accounting for bone mass), even modest amounts of age-related bone loss may lead to vertebral fracture in humans, while in apes, larger amounts of bone loss would be required before a vertebral fracture becomes likely. We present arguments that differences in vertebral bone size and shape associated with reduced bone strength in humans is linked to evolutionary adaptations associated with bipedalism."
A probabilistic approach to the craniometric variability of the genus Homo and inferences on the taxonomic affinities of the first human population dispersing out of Africa,"['Jimenez-Arenas, JM', 'Palmqvist, P', 'Perez-Claros, JA', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL,10.1016/j.quaint.2011.02.024,OCT 19 2011,4,"There is probably no paleoanthropological issue with deeper disagreements than the taxonomic status of the Early-Middle Pleistocene members of the genus Homo One reason could be the difficulty of estimating the relationship between morphological and taxonomic diversity. In an attempt to contribute new evidence to this debate, bootstrapping techniques are used for analyzing the cranial variability of Homo. The results indicate that: (i) the size of the neurocranium relative to the viscerocranium discriminates better among extant hominoid species than skull size; (ii) no cluster of fossil specimens of Homo exceeds the morphological variability of Gorilla gorilla, with the only exception of the one that comprises all members of Homo except modern humans; and (iii) some clusters are taxonomically more consistent than others, as long as they show a range of morphological variability similar to that found in both Pan troglodytes and Homo sapiens. According to these results, three taxa are tentatively suggested for Homo: (i) anatomically modern humans; (ii) an ""erectine"" morphotype plus Neanderthals; and (iii) a ""habiline"" cluster. Finally, the results indicate a greater taxonomic affinity for the human population involved in the first dispersal ""Out of Africa"" with the ""habiline"" group, which agrees with the early age reported for Dmanisi (1.77 Ma), a Georgian site placed at the gates of Europe.

Timing the origin of human malarias: the lemur puzzle,"['Pacheco, MA', 'Battistuzzi, FU', 'Junge, RE', 'Cornejo, OE', 'Williams, CV', 'Landau, I', 'Rabetafika, L', 'Snounou, G', 'Jones-Engel, L', 'Escalante, AA']",BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1186/1471-2148-11-299,OCT 12 2011,24,"Background: Timing the origin of human malarias has been a focus of great interest. Previous studies on the mitochondrial genome concluded that Plasmodium in primates, including those parasitic to humans, radiated relatively recently during a process where host switches were common. Those investigations, however, assumed constant rate of evolution and tightly bound (fixed) calibration points based on host fossils or host distribution. We investigate the effect of such assumptions using different molecular dating methods. We include parasites from Lemuroidea since their distribution provides an external validation to time estimates allowing us to disregard scenarios that cannot explain their introduction in Madagascar.

Results: We reject the assumption that the Plasmodium mitochondrial genome, as a unit or each gene separately, evolves at a constant rate. Our analyses show that Lemuroidea parasites are a monophyletic group that shares a common ancestor with all Catarrhini malarias except those related to P. falciparum. However, we found no evidence that this group of parasites branched with their hosts early in the evolution of primates. We applied relaxed clock methods and different calibrations points to explore the origin of primate malarias including those found in African apes. We showed that previous studies likely underestimated the origin of malarial parasites in primates.

Conclusions: The use of fossils from the host as absolute calibration and the assumption of a strict clock likely underestimate time when performing molecular dating analyses on malarial parasites. Indeed, by exploring different calibration points, we found that the time for the radiation of primate parasites may have taken place in the Eocene, a time consistent with the radiation of African anthropoids. The radiation of the four human parasite lineages was part of such events. The time frame estimated in this investigation, together with our phylogenetic analyses, made plausible a scenario where gorillas and humans acquired malaria from a Pan lineage."

For example, wild apes extract and reingest items from faeces. We term this behavior seed reingestion because the dung matrix is not consumed. We assessed the importance of seed reingestion in a population of savannah chimpanzees at Fongoli, southeastern Senegal, one of the hottest and driest areas of the species' range, where chimpanzees have a relatively narrow dietary repertoire. We observed habituated chimpanzees on 122 d during 8 mo in 2005 and 2006, employing both focal subject and scan sampling of identified individuals for 1278 h of data collection. Chimpanzees reingested seeds of 2 species: Parkia biglobosa and Adansonia digitata. Both seed species have a hard protective shell, and the embryos are rich in proteins and lipids. Chimpanzees initially ate the fruit matrix pulp and swallowed intact seeds before reingesting and chewing/destroying seeds. Seed reingestion accounted for almost 2% of feeding time. We suggest that at Fongoli this behavior may be an adaptive strategy to maximize food intake, by softening the seed's shell and making the seed's content more accessible."
Frequent and Recent Human Acquisition of Simian Foamy Viruses Through Apes' Bites in Central Africa,"['Betsem, E', 'Rua, R', 'Tortevoye, P', 'Froment, A', 'Gessain, A']",PLOS PATHOGENS,10.1371/journal.ppat.1002306,OCT 2011,45,"Human infection by simian foamy viruses (SFV) can be acquired by persons occupationally exposed to non-human primates (NHP) or in natural settings.

We studied 1,321 people from the general adult population (mean age 49 yrs, 640 women and 681 men) and 198 individuals, mostly men, all of whom had encountered a NHP with a resulting bite or scratch. All of these, either Pygmies (436) or Bantus (1085) live in villages in South Cameroon. A specific SFV Western blot was used and two nested PCRs (polymerase, and LTR) were done on all the positive/borderline samples by serology. In the general population, 2/1,321 (0.2%) persons were found to be infected. In the second group, 37/198 (18.6%) persons were SFV positive. They were mostly infected by apes (37/39) FV (mainly gorilla). Infection by monkey FV was less frequent (2/39). The viral origin of the amplified sequences matched with the history reported by the hunters, most of which (83%) are aged 20 to 40 years and acquired the infection during the last twenty years. The (pro) viral load in 33 individuals infected by a gorilla FV was quite low (, 1 to 145 copies per 10 5 cells) in the peripheral blood leucocytes. Of the 30 wives and 12 children from families of FV infected persons, only one woman was seropositive in WB without subsequent viral DNA amplification. We demonstrate a high level of recent transmission of SFVs to humans in natural settings specifically following severe gorilla bites during hunting activities.

Empirical Testing of the Function of Simple Shelters Made by Wild Chimpanzees,"['Stewart, FA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21580,OCT 2011,16,"All great apes build nightly a structure (""nest"" or ""bed"") that is assumed to function primarily as a sleeping-platform. However, several other nest function hypotheses have been proposed: antipredation, antipathogen, and thermoregulation. I tested these simple shelter functions of chimpanzee nests in an experiment for which I was the subject in Fongoli, Senegal. I slept 11 nights in chimpanzee nests and on the bare ground to test for differences in sleep quality, potential exposure to disease through bites from possible vectors, and insulation. No difference was found in the total amount of sleep nor in sleep quality; however, sleep was more disturbed on the ground. Differences in sleep disturbance between arboreal and ground conditions seemed primarily due to causes of anxiety and alertness, e.g., vocalizations of terrestrial mammals. Arboreal nest-sleeping seems to reduce risk of bites from possible disease vectors and provide insulation in cold conditions. This preliminary, but direct, test of chimpanzee nest function has implications for the evolutionary transition from limb-roosting to nest-reclining sleep in the hominoids, and from tree-to-ground sleep in the genus Homo.

Living archaeology: Artefacts of specific nest site fidelity in wild chimpanzees,"['Stewart, FA', 'Piel, AK', 'McGrew, WC']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2011.05.005,OCT 2011,21,"Savanna chimpanzees are known to re-use areas of the landscape for sleep, and patterns of chimpanzee sleeping site re-use are proposed as a referential model for early hominin archaeological site formation. We recorded the prevalence of deformed but healed branches and remnants of dead branches found around fresh nests at the savanna site of Issa in Ugalla, Tanzania. These old nest scars were found in 79% of 112 beds. We also randomly selected potential nesting locations for a subset of 32 beds within the same trees, and found nest scars in only 19% of these ""control"" locations. We then monitored 275 nests for up to 19 months for decay, regeneration of new branches, and re-use. Of these 275 nest locations, 24% were re-used within the first nine months of monitoring, and most re-use occurred when the nest had already decayed and was not easily visible from the ground. After 18 months, the proportion of specific nest positions re-used increased to 48%. This fidelity is likely a result of the creation of ideally-shaped support structures and supple new growth for mattress material with successive use of nest locations. We propose that specific nest site re-use may not be a direct product of environmental determination, but a result of ""niche construction"" through formation of good building sites within trees. Environmental modification through construction behaviour may have influenced both chimpanzee and early hominin ranging, and thus leaves behind recognisable patterns of artefact deposition across the landscape.

However, our understanding of their significance is still hindered by the lack of primate CNV data. We performed intraspecific comparative genomic hybridizations to identify loci harboring copy number variants in each of the four great apes: bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. For the first time, we could analyze differences in CNV location and frequency in these four species, and compare them with human CNVs and primate segmental duplication (SD) maps. In addition, for bonobo and gorilla, patterns of CNV and nucleotide diversity were studied in the same individuals. We show that CNVs have been subject to different selective pressures in different lineages. Evidence for purifying selection is stronger in gorilla CNVs overlapping genes, while positive selection appears to have driven the fixation of structural variants in the orangutan lineage. In contrast, chimpanzees and bonobos present high levels of common structural polymorphism, which is indicative of relaxed purifying selection together with the higher mutation rates induced by the known burst of segmental duplication in the ancestor of the African apes. Indeed, the impact of the duplication burst is noticeable by the fact that bonobo and chimpanzee share more CNVs with gorilla than expected. Finally, we identified a number of interesting genomic regions that present high-frequency CNVs in all great apes, while containing only very rare or even pathogenic structural variants in humans."

Recent analyses have suggested that the genomes of chimpanzee and human have been particularly enriched for this form of genetic variation. Here, we set out to assess the extent of structural variation in the gorilla lineage by generating 10-fold genomic sequence coverage from a western lowland gorilla and integrating these data into a physical and cytogenetic framework of structural variation. We discovered and validated over 7665 structural changes within the gorilla lineage, including sequence resolution of inversions, deletions, duplications, and mobile element insertions. A comparison with human and other ape genomes shows that the gorilla genome has been subjected to the highest rate of segmental duplication. We show that both the gorilla and chimpanzee genomes have experienced independent yet convergent patterns of structural mutation that have not occurred in humans, including the formation of subtelomeric heterochromatic caps, the hyperexpansion of segmental duplications, and bursts of retroviral integrations. Our analysis suggests that the chimpanzee and gorilla genomes are structurally more derived than either orangutan or human genomes."

Majority of wildlife used in traditional medicines is taken from the wild; hence demand by traditional medicine is a cause of over-exploitation of wild animals. Indiscriminate use of endangered species portends grievous implications for biodiversity conservation. This study investigated the dynamics of the use of pangolin in trado medicinal preparations amongst the Awori people.

Methods: Forty traditional Yorubic-medical practitioners (tymps) selected through stratified random-sampling technique were interviewed using open-ended questionnaires. Various aspects of the utilisation of pangolin in traditional medicinal practices were investigated. Data collected were analysed using simple frequencies and percentages.

Results: An average of 1.6 pangolins were utilised per tymp per month. About 43% of respondents contracted hunters for deliberate searches for the animals. More than 92% believed that pangolins' abundance is steadily decreasing. Above 97% reported a continuous decline in the size of pangolin. Pangolin was used in treating 47 conditions. Situations accommodated included those that can be treated by orthodox medicine like rheumatism and venereal diseases as well as some that are out of range for orthodox medicine including kleptomania and good luck charms. Some substitute animals like gorilla are under a greater conservation threat than pangolin.

Conclusions: Utilisation of pangolin in traditional medicine has no consideration for sustainability. Awareness should be created on people as regards the implications of unsustainable depletion of medicinal resources. Efforts should be intensified on ex-situ breeding of pangolin while subjecting the scales and other parts to laboratory studies to determine the bioactive constituents."

Beside the majority of these viruses, there are many genetically divergent variants, leading to the definition of HIV-2 and groups N, O and P in HIV-1. HIV-1 groups are the result of independent cross-species of viruses from chimpanzees and gorillas living in Western Central Africa. These simian origins and the necessary adaptation to the human species are the sources of genomic characteristics, phylogenetic and viral properties, specific to each group. The natural history of the infections associated to these variants nevertheless seems similar to that of HIV-M, with a high viral replication in vivo associated with immunosuppression. These non-M variants have all been described for the first time in patients of Cameroonian origin. The Western Central Africa is the epicenter of the epidemics of non-M variants, and the diffusion outside this area is anecdotal, except in France. In Cameroon, the origin of all groups currently described, HIV-O infections account for 1% of HIV infections, while only 15 cases of HIV-N infections and two HIV-P infections have been reported to date. If the important genetic diversity of these variants requires the use of specific tools for serological identification and molecular characterization, diagnosis and virological monitoring of these infections now appear possible with current commercial kits; however, very little data are available on the response to antiretroviral therapy and no recommendations are defined in case of failure. Despite improved knowledge of these rare variants, many fascinating questions persist about their origin, genetic evolution and reasons for their low epidemiological diffusion. Their discovery and the description of many simian viruses, demonstrates a dynamic transmission to humans, making it likely that there are other variants; we should therefore pursue a health monitoring, especially in front of any discrepancy between screening and therapeutic management of HIV infections.

Gorillas in the House of Light,"['Ashford, D']",CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY,10.1093/camqtly/bfr018,SEP 2011,0,"The Gorilla House at London Zoo was the first in a series of remarkable modernist zoo buildings to be built in Britain by Berthold Lubetkin in the 1930s. In this article his Gorilla House is considered in relation to the pioneering work on the significance of the 'Animal' in western philosophy initiated by Derrida. Lubetkin's modernist structure is seen to constitute an anthropocentric reinstating of the human order over the animal, a rear-guard action against a culture-wide anxiety stemming from what Freud called humanity's second trauma, the threat to the foundations of humanist thought posed by Darwinian theory. This article contends that the anthropoid apes were a magnet for such fears from the moment of their discovery, and seeks to establish the precise nature of the menace that Lubetkin chose to place in this landmark of modernism, in this first 'House of Light'."

Because reports from nonlivestock species are limited, this study examined nine presumptive isolates of Arcobacter spp. from an alpaca (Vicugria pacos), black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium suntan), gorilla (Troglodytes gorilla), gazelle (Eudorcas thomsoni), rhea (Rhea americana), and aborted equine fetuses. Seven of these nine phenotypically identified isolates of Arcobacter were confirmed by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay. The remaining two isolates were subsequently identified as Arcobacter skirrowii (Case 5) and Campylobacter jejuni (Case 6) by sequence analysis of a 527-base pair fragment of the 16S rRNA gene. Together, these cases underscore the challenges to a clinical laboratory of identifying Arcobacter in cases which mimic vibrionic abortion or leptospirosis."

This study evaluated the effect of different enrichment elements (explorative/manipulative, physical and feeding enrichment devices) on the behavior and physiology of two groups of great apes, gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at the Zoo-Aquarium of Madrid. The proposed prediction was that there would be a reduction of inactivity, anomalous and non-desired behavior, also on cortisol levels, as a result of the stimular improvements. The behaviors and cortisol faecal levels were compared between two different conditions: 1. previous phase without enrichment, 2. enrichment phase. The data analysis allowed measuring the efficiency of the enrichment, revealing that the frequency of inactivity and anomalous behaviors was significantly reduced in the enrichment phase. On the other hand, the frequency of exploratory-manipulative behavior increased in both species, whereas locomotors and feeding behaviors were reduced in gorillas but increased in chimpanzees. Also, the preferences of chimpanzees and gorillas for the diverse enrichments elements were different. In relation to the levels of cortisol, the results do not support the proposal for the initial hypothesis, both in the case of chimpanzees as in the case of gorillas, it had increased to such levels in the enrichment phase, the increase being significant just in the gorillas. The results on the behavioral parameters are consistent with the hypothesis because there is improvement induced by environmental enrichment."

In three different experiments, we varied the distance of the cups to the edge of the platform and the distance between the cups.

Local traditions in gorilla manual skill: evidence for observational learning of behavioral organization,"['Byrne, RW', 'Hobaiter, C', 'Klailova, M']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0403-8,SEP 2011,5,"Elaborate manual skills of food processing are known in several species of great ape; but their manner of acquisition is controversial. Local, ""cultural"" traditions show the influence of social learning, but it is uncertain whether this includes the ability to imitate the organization of behavior. Dispute has centered on whether program-level imitation contributes to the acquisition of feeding techniques in gorillas. Here, we show that captive western gorillas at Port Lympne, Kent, have developed a group-wide habit of feeding on nettles, using two techniques. We compare their nettle processing behavior with that of wild mountain gorillas in Rwanda. Both populations are similar in their repertoires of action elements, and in developing multi-step techniques for food processing, with coordinated asymmetric actions of the hands and iteration of parts of a process as ""subroutines"". Crucially, however, the two populations deal in different ways with the special challenges presented by nettle stings, with consistently different organizations of action elements. We conclude that, while an elaborate repertoire of manual actions and the ability to develop complex manual skills are natural characteristics of gorillas, the inter-site differences in nettle-eating technique are best explained as a consequence of social transmission. According to this explanation, gorillas can copy aspects of program organization from the behavior of others and they use this ability when learning how to eat nettles, resulting in consistent styles of processing by most individuals at each different site; like other great apes, gorillas have the precursor abilities for developing culture."
The gestural repertoire of the wild chimpanzee,"['Hobaiter, C', 'Byrne, RW']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0409-2,SEP 2011,57,"Great ape gestural communication is known to be intentional, elaborate and flexible; yet there is controversy over the best interpretation of the system and how gestures are acquired, perhaps because most studies have been made in restricted, captive settings. Here, we report the first systematic analysis of gesture in a population of wild chimpanzees. Over 266 days of observation, we recorded 4,397 cases of intentional gesture use in the Sonso community, Budongo, Uganda. We describe 66 distinct gesture types: this estimate appears close to asymptote, and the Sonso repertoire includes most gestures described informally at other sites. Differences in repertoire were noted between individuals and age classes, but in both cases, the measured repertoire size was predicted by the time subjects were observed gesturing. No idiosyncratic usages were found, i.e. no gesture type was used only by one individual. No support was found for the idea that gestures are acquired by 'ontogenetic ritualization' from originally effective actions; moreover, in detailed analyses of two gestures, action elements composing the gestures did not closely match those of the presumed original actions. Rather, chimpanzee gestures are species-typical; indeed, many are 'family-typical', because gesture types recorded in gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzee overlap extensively, with 24 gestures recorded in all three genera. Nevertheless, chimpanzee gestures are used flexibly across a range of contexts and show clear adjustment to audience (e.g. silent gestures for attentive targets, contact gestures for inattentive ones). Such highly intentional use of a species-typical repertoire raises intriguing questions for the evolution of advanced communication."
Engaging readers through language and pictures.

The analytical tools applied in this study are Halliday's Systemic Functional Grammar and Kress and van Leeuwen's Visual Social Semiotics.

The results, obtained from a comparison between the verbal and non-verbal semiotic modes, show that images seem to contribute more than words to the identification of the viewer with the main characters in the story. Some of the visual techniques chosen by Browne (frontal and medium angles, demand images, close-ups and focalizations) are evidence of the engagement that is created between the RPs themselves and between the RPs and the child-reader in this picture book. In addition, the analysis reveals that verbal and visual modalities inter-relate in this tale to emphasize the two different realities in which the main character, Hannah, is involved: Hannah and her father's isolation and loneliness contrast with Hannah and the gorilla' successful interaction and focus on companionship. A multimodal analysis in which both images and words are considered as interdependent components turns out to be necessary to delve into the potential of combining words and images in picture books.

Postural Strategies Employed by Orangutans (Pongo abelii) During Feeding in the Terminal Branch Niche,"['Myatt, JP', 'Thorpe, SKS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21548,SEP 2011,4,"Obtaining food in an arboreal habitat is complex due to the irregular and flexible nature of the supports available. As the largest predominantly arboreal primate, orangutans are expected to have developed particular postural strategies to enable them to feed successfully. In particular, they need to be able to cope within the terminal branch niche (TBN) as this is where the smallest, most compliant supports are, and also where the majority of the fruit and leaves are situated. We recorded feeding posture, along with a number of ecological and behavioral variables from different age-sex classes to enable analysis of the interactions between these and the compliance of the supports (as estimated from stiffness score). Suspensory postures with a pronograde orientation were used on the most compliant supports for all age-sex classes and appeared to play a particular role in facilitating safe use of the TBN by distributing body weight and using limbs for balance across multiple supports. This contradicts the idea that orthograde suspension evolved in response to the demands of feeding in the TBN. Adult males appear to use the same postures and feeding zones as the other age-sex classes, but appear to use stiffer supports where possible due to their larger body mass. Feeding method differed between the age-sex classes in relation to support stiffness, with larger adult males taking fewer risks due to their larger size, compared to infants and juveniles.

However, the detailed correspondence between hard and soft tissue structures in the proximal femoral region of extant great apes is relatively unknown, because dissection protocols typically do not comprise in-depth osteological descriptions. Here, we use computed tomography and virtopsy (virtual dissection) for non-invasive examination of the femoro-pelvic musculoskeletal anatomy in Pan troglodytes, P. paniscus, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, and Homo sapiens. Specifically, we analyze the topographic relationship between muscle attachment sites and surface structures of the proximal femoral shaft such as the lateral spiral pilaster. Our results show that the origin of the vastus lateralis muscle is anterior to the insertion of gluteus maximus in all examined great ape specimens and humans. In gorillas and orangutans, the insertion of gluteus maximus is on the inferior (anterolateral) side of the lateral spiral pilaster. In chimpanzees, however, the maximus insertion is on its superior (posteromedial) side, similar to the situation in modern humans. These findings support the hypothesis that chimpanzees and humans exhibit a shared-derived musculoskeletal topography of the proximal femoral region, irrespective of their different locomotor modes, whereas gorillas and orangutans represent the primitive condition. Caution is thus warranted when inferring locomotor behavior from the surface topography of the proximal femur of fossil hominins, as the morphology of this region may contain a strong phyletic signal that tends to blur locomotor adaptation.

Here, we provide details of the first parsimony and Bayesian cladistic analyses of the order Primates based exclusively on muscle data. The most parsimonious tree obtained from the cladistic analysis of 166 characters taken from the head, neck, pectoral and upper limb musculature is fully congruent with the most recent evolutionary molecular tree of Primates. That is, this tree recovers not only the relationships among the major groups of primates, i.e. Strepsirrhini {Tarsiiformes [Platyrrhini (Cercopithecidae, Hominoidea)]}, but it also recovers the relationships within each of these inclusive groups. Of the 301 character state changes occurring in this tree, ca. 30% are non-homoplasic evolutionary transitions; within the 220 changes that are unambiguously optimized in the tree, ca. 15% are reversions. The trees obtained by using characters derived from the muscles of the head and neck are more similar to the most recent evolutionary molecular tree than are the trees obtained by using characters derived from the pectoral and upper limb muscles. It was recently argued that since the Pan/Homo split, chimpanzees accumulated more phenotypic adaptations than humans, but our results indicate that modern humans accumulated more muscle character state changes than chimpanzees, and that both these taxa accumulated more changes than gorillas. This overview of the evolution of the primate head, neck, pectoral and upper limb musculature suggests that the only muscle groups for which modern humans have more muscles than most other extant primates are the muscles of the face, larynx and forearm."

The advantages of using saliva for measuring cortisol concentrations are three-fold: it is minimally invasive, multiple samples can be collected from the same individual in a short timeframe, and cortisol has a relatively short response time in saliva as compared with other materials. The purpose of this study was to: (1) conduct an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge as a physiological validation for an enzyme immunoassay to measure salivary cortisol in chimpanzees and (2) characterize the circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol in chimpanzees. We determined that salivary cortisol concentrations peaked 45 min following the ACTH challenge, which is similar to humans. Also, salivary cortisol concentrations peaked early in the morning and decreased throughout the day. We recommend that saliva collection may be the most effective method of measuring stress reactivity and has the potential to complement behavioral, cognitive, physiological, and welfare studies. Am.

Detailed examination of the composition and uniformity of such complex tool tasks has the potential to advance our understanding of the cognitive capabilities of tool users and processes underlying the maintenance of technological skills. In this study, we examined variation in chimpanzee tool use in termite gathering from video-recorded sequences that were scored to the level of functionally distinct behavioural elements. Overall, we found a high degree of similarity in tool-using techniques exhibited by individuals in this population. The number of elements in each individual's repertoire often exceeded that necessary to accomplish the task, with consistent differences in repertoire sizes between age classes. Adults and subadults had the largest repertoires and more consistently exhibited element strings than younger individuals. Larger repertoires were typically associated with incorporation of rare variants, some of which indicate flexibility and intelligence. These tool using apes aid us in understanding the evolution of technology, including that of our human ancestors, which showed a high degree of uniformity over large spatial scales."

Methodology/Principal Findings: We hypothesize that a vaccine strategy using CMV-based vectors expressing EBOV antigens may be ideally suited for use in inaccessible wildlife populations. To establish a 'proof-of-concept' for CMV-based vaccines against EBOV, we constructed a mouse CMV (MCMV) vector expressing a CD8(+) T cell epitope from the nucleoprotein (NP) of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) (MCMV/ZEBOV-NP(CTL)). MCMV/ZEBOV-NP(CTL) induced high levels of long-lasting (> 8 months) CD8(+) T cells against ZEBOV NP in mice. Importantly, all vaccinated animals were protected against lethal ZEBOV challenge. Low levels of anti-ZEBOV antibodies were only sporadically detected in vaccinated animals prior to ZEBOV challenge suggesting a role, at least in part, for T cells in protection.

Conclusions/Significance: This study demonstrates the ability of a CMV-based vaccine approach to protect against an highly virulent human pathogen, and supports the potential for 'disseminating' CMV-based EBOV vaccines to prevent EBOV transmission in wildlife populations."
How to Avoid the 'Invisible Gorilla' in Aluminum Smelting Process Control: Visual Guidelines,"['Gao, YS', 'Taylor, MP', 'Chen, JJJ', 'Hautus, MJ']",JOM,NA,AUG 2011,0,"Over the last three decades, process control in aluminum smelters has improved significantly as it is the biggest leverage for cost and energy reduction in production and product quality improvement, as well as for meeting environmental compliance. The implementation of computerized automatic control systems two decades ago was a step change in improvement in the state of the art of process control. However, the complex and dynamic nature of the process requires human monitoring, diagnosis, and intervention from time to time. This study investigates the use of the supervisory screen of the control system of a smelter, as well as the effectiveness of visual guidelines to help the operators to identify process abnormalities. The results show that visual guidelines such as voltage patterns which are used as a reference improve the performance of the operators. Detection time and false-alarm rates were reduced in addition to increasing detection sensitivities. It is proposed that a higher level of human and system interaction would improve the overall performance process control."
The Magic Cup: Great Apes and Domestic Dogs (Canis familiaris) Individuate Objects According to Their Properties,"['Brauer, J', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0023009,AUG 2011,7,"Despite current interest in dog (Canis familiaris) cognition, very little is known about how dogs represent objects and how they compare with other species, such as the great apes. Therefore, we investigated how dogs and great apes (chimpanzees [Pan troglodytes], bonobos [Pan paniscus], orangutans [Pongo pygmaeus], gorillas [Gorilla gorilla]) individuate objects in a classical violation of expectation paradigm. We used a container (magic cup) with a double bottom that allowed us to change the type of food that subjects had seen being placed in the container. Using a 2 X 2 design, we varied whether subjects received a generally preferred food and whether the food was substituted (surprise trials) or not (baseline trials). Apes showed increased begging and looking behaviors and dogs showed increased smelling behavior. Both species stayed near the experimenter more frequently in the surprise trials compared with baseline trials. Both species reacted to positive (i.e., good food substituted for bad food) and negative (i.e., bad food substituted for good food) surprises. These results suggest that apes and dogs were able to individuate objects according to their properties or type in comparable ways. In addition, we looked for frustration and elation effects, but subjects' behaviors were not influenced by the food they saw and which they received in previous trials."
"Deep trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodelling in the placental bed of the lowland gorilla
","['Pijnenborg, R', 'Vercruysse, L', 'Carter, AM']",PLACENTA,10.1016/j.placenta.2011.05.007,AUG 2011,9,"In contrast to baboon or rhesus macaque, trophoblast invasion in the human placental bed occurs by the interstitial as well as the endovascular route and reaches as deep as the inner myometrium. We here describe two rare specimens of gorilla placenta. In the light of recent findings in the chimpanzee, we postulated the occurrence of deep invasion in gorilla pregnancy. Tissues were processed for histology (PAS, orcein), lectin staining (Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1) and immunohistochemistry (cytokeratin 7/17, a-actin). A specimen of young but undetermined gestational age included deep placental bed tissue, showing interstitial and spiral artery invasion of the inner myometrium as well as the decidua. The cell density and depth of trophoblast invasion was equivalent to a human placental bed of 10-14 weeks. Intraluminal trophoblasts were not seen in any of the invaded vessels, allowing no definite conclusions about the origin of the intramural trophoblast and the time-course of spiral artery invasion. A different late second trimester placenta specimen showed scattered extravillous trophoblast in the basal plate and underlying decidua, as well as a remodelled spiral artery containing intramural trophoblast. Absence of inner myometrial tissue precluded assessment of invasion depth in this later specimen. Despite the limited material we can conclude that key aspects of trophoblast invasion are shared by the three hominid species: gorilla, chimpanzee and human. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Ontogeny of object permanence and object tracking in the carrion crow, Corvus corone","['Hoffmann, A', 'Ruttler, V', 'Nieder, A']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.05.012,AUG 2011,19,"Object permanence is a component of physical cognition and refers to the knowledge that an object still exists when out of sight or displaced. Many animal species develop object permanence skills in a similar sequence as human infants, but few master the most complex aspects, such as representing invisibly displaced objects. We tested six developing, hand-raised carrion crows on Piagetian object permanence applying a randomized presentation of Uzgiris & Hunt's (1975, Assessment in Infancy: Ordinal Scales of Psychological Development, University of Illinois Press) Scale 1 tasks. In addition, the birds were tested on transpositions, visible and invisible rotational displacement tasks. The results from this longitudinal study demonstrate that young carrion crows did develop full Piagetian object permanence skills including Stage 6 (with the exception of task 15). This ability developed gradually, albeit with slight changes in the order of mastery compared to human infants. Systematically different points in time at which same-aged crows mastered the tasks indicated interindividual cognitive differences. The crows showed perseverative searches at a previously rewarded location (the so-called 'A-not-B error'). They mastered visible rotational displacements consistently, but failed at more complex invisible rotational displacements. The overall pattern of the development and competence of object permanence in crows is similar to other corvid species. The absolute ages at which corvid species pass the tests seem to be a function of the hatching-to-fledging time. The findings may reflect maturing executive functions rather than being related to food-storing habits. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Hindlimb muscle architecture in non-human great apes and a comparison of methods for analysing inter-species variation,"['Myatt, JP', 'Crompton, RH', 'Thorpe, SKS']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2011.01383.x,AUG 2011,9,"By relating an animal's morphology to its functional role and the behaviours performed, we can further develop our understanding of the selective factors and constraints acting on the adaptations of great apes. Comparison of muscle architecture between different ape species, however, is difficult because only small sample sizes are ever available. Further, such samples are often comprised of different age-sex classes, so studies have to rely on scaling techniques to remove body mass differences. However, the reliability of such scaling techniques has been questioned. As datasets increase in size, more reliable statistical analysis may eventually become possible. Here we employ geometric and allometric scaling techniques, and ANCOVAs (a form of general linear model, GLM) to highlight and explore the different methods available for comparing functional morphology in the non-human great apes. Our results underline the importance of regressing data against a suitable body size variable to ascertain the relationship (geometric or allometric) and of choosing appropriate exponents by which to scale data. ANCOVA models, while likely to be more robust than scaling for species comparisons when sample sizes are high, suffer from reduced power when sample sizes are low. Therefore, until sample sizes are radically increased it is preferable to include scaling analyses along with ANCOVAs in data exploration. Overall, the results obtained from the different methods show little significant variation, whether in muscle belly mass, fascicle length or physiological cross-sectional area between the different species. This may reflect relatively close evolutionary relationships of the non-human great apes; a universal influence on morphology of generalised orthograde locomotor behaviours or, quite likely, both."

For instance, gorillas were found to be infected by parasites closely related to Plasmodium falciparum, suggesting that the human malignant malaria agent may have arisen after a transfer from gorillas. Although this scenario is likely in light of the data collected in great apes, it remained to be ascertained whether P. falciparum-related parasites may infect other nonhuman primates in Africa. Using molecular tools, we here explore the diversity of Plasmodium species infecting monkeys in Central Africa. In addition to previously described Hepatocystis and Plasmodium species (Plasmodium gonderi and Plasmodium sp DAJ-2004), we have found one African monkey to be infected by a P. falciparum-related parasite. Examination of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of this parasite reveals that it is specific of nonhuman primates, indicating that P. falciparum-related pathogens can naturally circulate in some monkey populations in Africa. We also show that at least two distinct genetic entities of P. falciparum infect nonhuman primates and humans, respectively. Our discoveries bring into question the proposed gorilla origin of human P. falciparum."
Stereotypic Behavior in Wild Marine Carnivores?,"['Miller, LJ', 'Kuczaj, S', 'Herzing, D']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20347,JUL-AUG 2011,2,"Stereotypic behavior is observed in many species within zoological institutions. Attempts to reduce such behavior typically involve some form of environmental enrichment that provides opportunities for species appropriate behavior or some degree of control within the environment. However, environmental enrichment has never been completely successful in eliminating stereotypic behavior for an entire group of animals within a zoological facility. In the wild, stereotypic behavior is rarely observed. Documenting the occurrence of stereotypic behavior in the wild, and circumstances in which it occurs, could help provide insight into the causes of such behavior within zoological institutions. The following commentary details the observations of wild lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) engaging in a stereotyped swimming pattern behind a research vessel north of Grand Bahama Island, Bahamas. We consider a possible explanation for the sharks' behavior and hope to stimulate conversation as well as increase examination of animal management routines in zoological facilities.

In this study, human monoclonal antibody technology was used to assign human ABO blood groups to whole blood samples from great apes housed in North American and European zoos and in situ managed populations, as a practical means to assist blood transfusion situations for these species. From a subset of each of the species (bonobo, common chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutans), DNA sequence analysis was performed to determine blood group genotype. Bonobo and common chimpanzee populations were predominantly group A, which concurred with historic literature and was confirmed by genotyping. In agreement with historic literature, a smaller number of the common chimpanzees sampled were group O, although this O blood group was more often present in wild-origin animals as compared with zoo-born animals. Gorilla blood groups were inconclusive by monoclonal antibody techniques, and genetic studies were inconsistent with any known human blood group. As the genus and, specifically, the Bornean species, orangutans were identified with all human blood groups, including O, which had not been reported previously. Following this study, it was concluded that blood groups of bonobo, common chimpanzees, and some orangutans can be reliably assessed by human monoclonal antibody technology. However, this technique was not reliable for gorilla or orangutans other than those with blood group A. Even in those species with reliable blood group detection, blood transfusion preparation must include cross-matching to minimize adverse reactions for the patient. Zoo Biol 30: 427-444, 2011.

Can lemurs (Eulemur fulvus and E. macaco) use abstract representations of quantities to master the reverse-reward contingency task?,"['Genty, E', 'Roeder, JJ']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-011-0245-7,JUL 2011,3,"In previous studies we demonstrated that brown and black lemurs (Eulemur fulvus and E. macaco) showed self-control abilities under a reverse-reward contingency. They were able to significantly select the smaller quantity of food to be rewarded with the larger one and to generalize this ability when presented with two rewards that differed in quality. In the present study, previously trained subjects had to choose between graphic representations of two different quantities of food under the reverse-reward contingency. Three out of four subjects learned to associate a graphic representation of the reward with the corresponding quantity. Only one subject consistently selected the representation of the smaller quantity to be rewarded with the larger quantity of food and therefore showed abstraction as well as relative numerousness skills. Indeed, she was able to discriminate between representations of different quantities and to ordinate them. We discuss how primates mentally represent food quantities and how self-control is involved in foraging strategies."
Great apes' strategies to map spatial relations,"['Hribar, A', 'Haun, D', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0385-6,JUL 2011,8,"We investigated reasoning about spatial relational similarity in three great ape species: chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans. Apes were presented with three spatial mapping tasks in which they were required to find a reward in an array of three cups, after observing a reward being hidden in a different array of three cups. To obtain a food reward, apes needed to choose the cup that was in the same relative position (i.e., on the left) as the baited cup in the other array. The three tasks differed in the constellation of the two arrays. In Experiment 1, the arrays were placed next to each other, forming a line. In Experiment 2, the positioning of the two arrays varied each trial, being placed either one behind the other in two rows, or next to each other, forming a line. Finally, in Experiment 3, the two arrays were always positioned one behind the other in two rows, but misaligned. Results suggested that apes compared the two arrays and recognized that they were similar in some way. However, we believe that instead of mapping the left-left, middle-middle, and right-right cups from each array, they mapped the cups that shared the most similar relations to nearby landmarks (table's visual boundaries)."
Dogs are able to solve a means-end task,"['Range, F', 'Hentrup, M', 'Viranyi, Z']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0394-5,JUL 2011,12,"Dogs, although very skilled in social-communicative tasks, have shown limited abilities in the domain of physical cognition. Consequently, several researchers hypothesized that domestication enhanced dogs' cognitive abilities in the social realm, but relaxed selection on the physical one. For instance, dogs failed to demonstrate means-end understanding, an important form of relying on physical causal connection, when tested in a string-pulling task. Here, we tested dogs in an ""on/off"" task using a novel approach. Thirty-two dogs were confronted with four different conditions in which they could choose between two boards one with a reward ""on"" and another one with a reward ""off"" (reward was placed next to the board). The dogs chose the correct board when (1) both rewards were placed at the same distance from the dog, when (2) the reward placed ""on"" the board was closer to the dog, and (3) even when the reward placed ""off"" the board was much closer to the dog and was food. Interestingly, in the latter case, dogs did not perform above chance, if instead of a direct reward, the dogs had to retrieve an object placed on the board to get a food reward. In contrast to previous string-pulling studies, our results show that dogs are able to solve a means-end task even if proximity of the unsupported reward is a confounding factor."
"Female ""Dispersal"" in Hamadryas Baboons: Transfer Among Social Units in a Multilevel Society","['Swedell, L', 'Saunders, J', 'Schreier, A', 'Davis, B', 'Tesfaye, T', 'Pines, M']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21504,JUL 2011,22,"Unlike most cercopithecines, hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas hamadryas) are characterized by female-biased dispersal. To clarify this pattern within the context of their hierarchical social system (comprising one-male units, clans, bands, and troops), we report here 7 years of data on female transfers among social units in wild hamadryas baboons in Ethiopia. Female tenure in one-male units (OMUs) ranged from 1 to 2,556 days (N = 208) and survival analysis revealed a median tenure length of 1,217 days (40 months). Changes in OMU membership consisted almost exclusively of takeovers by males, not voluntary transfer. Of 130 takeovers, 67% occurred within the band and 33% across bands, and, of the 22 takeovers for which we have clan membership data, 77% occurred within, not between, clans. These results reinforce the notion that hamadryas female dispersal is not analogous to sex-biased dispersal in other taxa, because (1) at least in Ethiopian populations, females do not disperse voluntarily but are transferred, often forcibly, by males; (2) only dispersal between bands will promote gene flow, whereas females are most often rearranged within bands; (3) hamadryas females undergo social dispersal but not usually locational dispersal; and (4) while male hamadryas are far more philopatric than females, they have been observed to disperse. It thus appears that the ancestral baboon pattern of female philopatry and male dispersal has evolved into a system in which neither sex is motivated to disperse, but females are forcibly transferred by males, leading to female-mediated gene flow, and males more rarely disperse to find females.

Comparative analyses of the spatial organization of cortical neurons, including minicolumns, can aid our understanding of the functionally relevant aspects of microcircuitry. We measured horizontal spacing distance and gray-level ratio in layer III of 4 regions of human and ape cortex in all 6 living hominoid species: frontal pole (Brodmann area [BA] 10), and primary motor (BA 4), primary somatosensory (BA 3), and primary visual cortex (BA 17). Our results identified significant differences between humans and apes in the frontal pole (BA 10). Within the human brain, there were also significant differences between the frontal pole and 2 of the 3 regions studied (BA 3 and BA 17). Differences between BA 10 and BA 4 were present but did not reach significance. These findings in combination with earlier findings on BA 44 and BA 45 suggest that human brain evolution was likely characterized by an increase in the number and width of minicolumns and the space available for interconnectivity between neurons in the frontal lobe, especially the prefrontal cortex."
Effects of Anthropogenic Disturbance on Indri (Indri indri) Health in Madagascar,"['Junge, RE', 'Barrett, MA', 'Yoder, AD']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20938,JUL 2011,11,"Anthropogenic habitat disturbance impairs ecosystem health by fragmenting forested areas, introducing environmental contamination, and reducing the quality of habitat resources. The effect of this disturbance on wildlife health is of particular concern in Madagascar, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, where anthropogenic pressures on the environment remain high. Despite the conservation importance of threatened lemur populations in Madagascar, few data exist on the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on lemur health. To examine these impacts, indri (Indri indri) populations were evaluated from two forest reserves that differ in their exposure to anthropogenic disturbance. We compared the health status of 36 indri individuals from two sites: one population from a protected, undisturbed area of lowland evergreen humid forest and the other population from a reserve exposed to frequent tourism and forest degradation. Comparison of indri health parameters between sites suggests an impact of anthropogenic disturbance, including significant differences in leukocyte count and differential, 12 serum parameters, 6 trace minerals, and a higher diversity of parasites, with a significant difference in the presence of the louse, Trichophilopterus babakotophilus. These data suggest that indri living in disturbed forests may experience physiological changes and increased susceptibility to parasitism, which may ultimately impair reproductive success and survival.

When and How Well Can Human-Socialized Capuchins Match Actions Demonstrated by a Familiar Human?,"['Fragaszy, DM', 'Deputte, B', 'Cooper, EJ', 'Colbert-White, EN', 'Hemery, C']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20941,JUL 2011,4,"Capuchin monkeys have provided uneven evidence of matching actions they observe others perform. In accord with theories emphasizing the attentional salience of object movement and spatial relationships, we predicted that human-reared monkeys would better match events in which a human demonstrator moved an object into a new relation with another object or surface than other kinds of actions. Three human-reared capuchins were invited repeatedly by a familiar human to perform a fixed set of actions upon objects or upon their bodies, using the ""Do as I do"" procedure. Actions directed at the body were matched less reliably than actions involving objects, and actions were matched best when the monkey looked at the demonstration for at least 2 sec and performed its action within a few seconds after the demonstration. The most commonly matched actions were those that one monkey performed relatively often when the experiment began. One monkey partially reproduced three novel actions (out of 48 demonstrations), all three involving moving or placing objects, and two of which it also performed following other demonstrations. These findings contribute convergent evidence that capuchin monkeys display social facilitation of activity, enhanced interest in particular objects and emulation of spatial outcomes. This pattern can support the development of shared manipulative skills, as evident in traditions of foraging and tool use in natural settings. The findings do not suggest that human rearing substantively altered capuchins' ability or interest in matching the actions of a familiar human, although visual attention to the human demonstrator may have been greater in these monkeys than in normally reared monkeys.

The Spread of Fecally Transmitted Parasites in Socially-Structured Populations,"['Nunn, CL', 'Thrall, PH', 'Leendertz, FH', 'Boesch, C']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0021677,JUN 30 2011,13,"Mammals are infected by a wide array of gastrointestinal parasites, including parasites that also infect humans and domesticated animals. Many of these parasites are acquired through contact with infectious stages present in soil, feces or vegetation, suggesting that ranging behavior will have a major impact on their spread. We developed an individual-based spatial simulation model to investigate how range use intensity, home range overlap, and defecation rate impact the spread of fecally transmitted parasites in a population composed of social groups (i.e., a socially structured population). We also investigated the effects of epidemiological parameters involving host and parasite mortality rates, transmissibility, disease-related mortality, and group size. The model was spatially explicit and involved the spillover of a gastrointestinal parasite from a reservoir population along the edge of a simulated reserve, which was designed to mimic the introduction pathogens into protected areas. Animals ranged randomly within a ""core"" area, with biased movement toward the range center when outside the core. We systematically varied model parameters using a Latin hypercube sampling design. Analyses of simulation output revealed a strong positive association between range use intensity and the prevalence of infection. Moreover, the effects of range use intensity were similar in magnitude to effects of group size, mortality rates, and the per-contact probability of transmission. Defecation rate covaried positively with gastrointestinal parasite prevalence. Greater home range overlap had no positive effects on prevalence, with a smaller core resulting in less range overlap yet more intensive use of the home range and higher prevalence. Collectively, our results reveal that parasites with fecal-oral transmission spread effectively in socially structured populations. Future application should focus on parameterizing the model with empirically derived ranging behavior for different species or populations and data on transmission characteristics of different infectious organisms."
Bocavirus Episome in Infected Human Tissue Contains Non-Identical Termini,"['Kapoor, A', 'Hornig, M', 'Asokan, A', 'Williams, B', 'Henriquez, JA', 'Lipkin, WI']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0021362,JUN 28 2011,41,"Human bocaviruses (HBoV) are highly prevalent human infections whose pathogenic potential remains unknown. Recent identification of the first non-human primate bocavirus [1] in captive gorillas raised the possibility of the persistent nature of bocavirus infection. To characterize bocavirus infection in humans, we tested intestinal biopsies from 22 children with gastrointestinal disease for the presence of HBoV DNA. Four HBoV-positive tissue samples were analyzed to determine whether viral DNA was present in the linear genomic, the episomal closed circular or the host genome-integrated form. Whereas one tissue sample positive for HBoV3 contained the episomal form (HBoV3-E1), none had the genome-integrated form. The complete genome sequence of HBoV3-E1 contains 5319 nucleotides of which 513 represent the non-coding terminal sequence. The secondary structure of HBoV3-E1 termini suggests several conserved and variable features among human and animal bocaviruses. Our observation that HBoV genome exists as head-to-tail monomer in infected tissue either reflects the likely evolution of alternative replication mechanism in primate bocaviruses or a mechanism of viral persistence in their host. Moreover, we identified the HBoV genomic terminal sequences that will be helpful in developing reverse genetic systems for these widely prevalent parvoviruses.

Significance: HBoV have been found in healthy human controls as well as individuals with respiratory or gastrointestinal disease. Our findings suggest that HBoV DNA can exist as episomes in infected human tissues and therefore can likely establish persistent infection in the host. Previous efforts to grow HBoV in cell culture and to develop reverse genetic systems have been unsuccessful. Complete genomic sequence of the HBoV3 episome and its genomic termini will improve our understanding of HBoV replication mechanism and its pathogenesis."
Increased RNA editing in EAAT2 pre-mRNA from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients: Involvement of a cryptic polyadenylation site,"['Flomen, R', 'Makoff, A']",NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS,10.1016/j.neulet.2011.04.047,JUN 22 2011,5,"The astroglial EAAT2 glutamate transporter is essential for clearing glutamate in the central nervous system and protecting against excitotoxicity. It is implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, the most common type of motor neurone disease) where less EAAT2 is found, possibly involving aberrant intron 7 retention transcripts. We report adenine/inosine RNA editing at a novel site in intron 7 of EAAT2 pre-mRNA that appears to activate a cryptic alternative polyadenylation site, generating intron 7 retention transcripts. This polyadenylation site includes two overlapping polyadenylation signals opposite the editing site in a strong stem-loop, which is highly conserved in primates. In pre-mRNA, we observed variable editing levels at this site, which were significantly higher in spinal cord (p = 0.001) and motor cortex (p = 0.005) from ALS patients, but not in cerebellum, demonstrating specificity for clinically relevant regions. By contrast, incomplete mRNA molecules polyadenylated in intron 7 are always completely edited. Cell culture experiments confirm this strong correlation between editing and polyadenylation in intron 7, strongly suggesting activation of the alternative polyadenylation site by editing. Prediction of inosine base-pairing from published data suggests that RNA editing releases the polyadenylation signals from the stem-loop, providing a plausible mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of RNA editing activating an alternative polyadenylation signal. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
Human and great ape red blood cells differ in plasmalogen levels and composition,"['Moser, AB', 'Steinberg, SJ', 'Watkins, PA', 'Moser, HW', 'Ramaswamy, K', 'Siegmund, KD', 'Lee, DR', 'Ely, JJ', 'Ryder, OA', 'Hacia, JG']",LIPIDS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE,10.1186/1476-511X-10-101,JUN 17 2011,9,"Background: Plasmalogens are ether phospholipids required for normal mammalian developmental, physiological, and cognitive functions. They have been proposed to act as membrane antioxidants and reservoirs of polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as influence intracellular signaling and membrane dynamics. Plasmalogens are particularly enriched in cells and tissues of the human nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems. Humans with severely reduced plasmalogen levels have reduced life spans, abnormal neurological development, skeletal dysplasia, impaired respiration, and cataracts. Plasmalogen deficiency is also found in the brain tissue of individuals with Alzheimer disease.

Results: In a human and great ape cohort, we measured the red blood cell (RBC) levels of the most abundant types of plasmalogens. Total RBC plasmalogen levels were lower in humans than bonobos, chimpanzees, and gorillas, but higher than orangutans. There were especially pronounced cross-species differences in the levels of plasmalogens with a C16:0 moiety at the sn-1 position. Humans on Western or vegan diets had comparable total RBC plasmalogen levels, but the latter group showed moderately higher levels of plasmalogens with a C18:1 moiety at the sn-1 position. We did not find robust sex-specific differences in human or chimpanzee RBC plasmalogen levels or composition. Furthermore, human and great ape skin fibroblasts showed only modest differences in peroxisomal plasmalogen biosynthetic activity. Human and chimpanzee microarray data indicated that genes involved in plasmalogen biosynthesis show cross-species differential expression in multiple tissues.

Conclusion: We propose that the observed differences in human and great ape RBC plasmalogens are primarily caused by their rates of biosynthesis and/or turnover. Gene expression data raise the possibility that other human and great ape cells and tissues differ in plasmalogen levels. Based on the phenotypes of humans and rodents with plasmalogen disorders, we propose that cross-species differences in tissue plasmalogen levels could influence organ functions and processes ranging from cognition to reproduction to aging."
Infants' knowledge of their own species,"['Heron-Delaney, M', 'Wirth, S', 'Pascalis, O']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2010.0371,JUN 12 2011,20,"Recognition of individuals at first sight is important for social species and can be achieved by attending to facial or body information. Previous research suggests that infants possess a perceptual template for evolutionarily relevant stimuli, which may include humans, dangerous animals (e.g. snakes), but not non-dangerous animals. To be effective, such a mechanism should result in a systematic preference for attending to humans over non-dangerous animals. Using a preferential looking paradigm, the present studies investigated the nature of infants' early representation of humans. We show that 3.5- and six-month-old infants attend more to human beings than non-human primates (a gorilla or monkey) which are examplars of non-dangerous animals. This occurred when infants were presented with head or body information in isolation, as well as when both are presented simultaneously. This early preference for humans by 3.5 months of age suggests that there is a basic representation for humans, which includes both head and/or body information. However, neonates demonstrated a preference only for human faces over non-human primate faces, not for humans over non-human primates when the stimuli were presented with both head and body simultaneously. The results show that although neonates display a preference for human faces over others, preference for the human body only develops later, in the first few months of life. This suggests that infants have acquired some knowledge about the human body at 3.5 months of age that may have developed from their privileged experience with other humans in the first few months of life, rather than an innate ability to detect humans in their entirety."
"Comparing the Performances of Apes (Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus) and Human Children (Homo sapiens) in the Floating Peanut Task","['Hanus, D', 'Mendes, N', 'Tennie, C', 'Call, J']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0019555,JUN 8 2011,32,"Recently, Mendes et al. [1] described the use of a liquid tool (water) in captive orangutans. Here, we tested chimpanzees and gorillas for the first time with the same ""floating peanut task."" None of the subjects solved the task. In order to better understand the cognitive demands of the task, we further tested other populations of chimpanzees and orangutans with the variation of the peanut initially floating or not. Twenty percent of the chimpanzees but none of the orangutans were successful. Additional controls revealed that successful subjects added water only if it was necessary to obtain the nut. Another experiment was conducted to investigate the reason for the differences in performance between the unsuccessful (Experiment 1) and the successful (Experiment 2) chimpanzee populations. We found suggestive evidence for the view that functional fixedness might have impaired the chimpanzees' strategies in the first experiment. Finally, we tested how human children of different age classes perform in an analogous experimental setting. Within the oldest group (8 years), 58 percent of the children solved the problem, whereas in the youngest group (4 years), only 8 percent were able to find the solution."
Extreme Conservation Leads to Recovery of the Virunga Mountain Gorillas,"['Robbins, MM', 'Gray, M', 'Fawcett, KA', 'Nutter, FB', 'Uwingeli, P', 'Mburanumwe, I', 'Kagoda, E', 'Basabose, A', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Cranfield, MR', 'Byamukama, J', 'Spelman, LH', 'Robbins, AM']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0019788,JUN 8 2011,27,"As wildlife populations are declining, conservationists are under increasing pressure to measure the effectiveness of different management strategies. Conventional conservation measures such as law enforcement and community development projects are typically designed to minimize negative human influences upon a species and its ecosystem. In contrast, we define ""extreme"" conservation as efforts targeted to deliberately increase positive human influences, including veterinary care and close monitoring of individual animals. Here we compare the impact of both conservation approaches upon the population growth rate of the critically endangered Virunga mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), which increased by 50% since their nadir in 1981, from approximately 250 to nearly 400 gorillas. Using demographic data from 1967-2008, we show an annual decline of 0.7%+/- 0.059% for unhabituated gorillas that received intensive levels of conventional conservation approaches, versus an increase 4.1%+/- 0.088% for habituated gorillas that also received extreme conservation measures. Each group of habituated gorillas is now continuously guarded by a separate team of field staff during daylight hours and receives veterinary treatment for snares, respiratory disease, and other life-threatening conditions. These results suggest that conventional conservation efforts prevented a severe decline of the overall population, but additional extreme measures were needed to achieve positive growth. Demographic stochasticity and socioecological factors had minimal impact on variability in the growth rates. Veterinary interventions could account for up to 40% of the difference in growth rates between habituated versus unhabituated gorillas, with the remaining difference likely arising from greater protection against poachers. Thus, by increasing protection and facilitating veterinary treatment, the daily monitoring of each habituated group contributed to most of the difference in growth rates. Our results argue for wider consideration of extreme measures and offer a startling view of the enormous resources that may be needed to conserve some endangered species."
Strontium isotope evidence for landscape use by early hominins,"['Copeland, SR', 'Sponheimer, M', 'de Ruiter, DJ', 'Lee-Thorp, JA', 'Codron, D', 'le Roux, PJ', 'Grimes, V', 'Richards, MP', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS']",NATURE,10.1038/nature10149,JUN 2 2011,51,"Ranging and residence patterns among early hominins have been indirectly inferred from morphology(1,2), stone-tool sourcing(3), referential models(4,5) and phylogenetic models(6-8). However, the highly uncertain nature of such reconstructions limits our understanding of early hominin ecology, biology, social structure and evolution. We investigated landscape use in Australopithecus africanus and Paranthropus robustus from the Sterkfontein and Swartkrans cave sites in South Africa using strontium isotope analysis, a method that can help to identify the geological substrate on which an animal lived during tooth mineralization. Here we show that a higher proportion of small hominins than large hominins had non-local strontium isotope compositions. Given the relatively high levels of sexual dimorphism in early hominins, the smaller teeth are likely to represent female individuals, thus indicating that females were more likely than males to disperse from their natal groups. This is similar to the dispersal pattern found in chimpanzees(9), bonobos(10) and many human groups(11), but dissimilar from that of most gorillas and other primates(12). The small proportion of demonstrably non-local large hominin individuals could indicate that male australopiths had relatively small home ranges, or that they preferred dolomitic landscapes."
"Humanized monkeys, human monkeys: origin of identities in the light of Western representations","['Herzfeld, C', 'Van Schuylenbergh, P']",SOCIAL SCIENCE INFORMATION SUR LES SCIENCES SOCIALES,10.1177/0539018410397745,JUN 2011,1,"This article explores certain collective representations related to the great divide between human and animal. But rather than engage on the reassuring path of inventorying human uniqueness, it mobilizes various places where humans and the ambassadors of four particular species - chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and orang-outan - meet, and exchange habits and skills. A careful study of the few historical milestones in the history of the relationship between humans and the great apes allows us to highlight the limitations of the Western dualistic division of the animal kingdom into poles that radically separate the human species from the other animal species. In the space where humans and apes come together, the apes show a form of 'becoming-human' that echoes the 'becoming-animal' outlined by Deleuze & Guattari. The primates in fact adopt the customs, capabilities and lineaments of human ethos, thus blurring the often too linear boundaries between human and animal, and calling into question the rigidity of several great oppositions that structure our thinking and discourse: nature and culture, wild and domestic, bestial and human."
Mucous Gland Metaplasia in the Esophagus and Gastric Mucosa in Baboons,"['Rubio, CA', 'Owston, M', 'Orrego, A', 'Nilsson, R', 'Lofdahl, H', 'Nesi, G', 'Dick, EJ']",ANTICANCER RESEARCH,NA,JUN 2011,3,"Background: Chewing of regurgitated food elicits in baboons life-long gastro-esophageal reflux (GER). The acid reflux transforms the multilayered squamous cell epithelium of the esophagus into columnar-lined mucosa with mucus-producing accessory glands. The function of this mucous gland metaplasia (MGM), which mimics Barrett's mucosa with MGM in humans, is to buffer the gastric acid entering the esophagus during regurgitation. In a previous study of entire esophagi, the majority of baboons showed MGM. The gastric mucosa was not investigated. Materials and Methods: Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections from the esophagus, from the lesser gastric curvature and from the greater gastric curvature were collected separately from 50 adult baboons. The presence of MGM was assessed in each one of these locations. Results: MGM was demonstrated in 92% (46/50) of blocks from the esophagus, in 98% (49/50) of blocks from the lesser curvature and in 90% (45/50) of those of the greater curvature (fundus). Conclusion: The majority of the animals had MGM, not only in the esophagus but also in the proximal gastric mucosa. Rationally, MGM in baboons starts in the distal esophagus and proceeds downwards, towards the proximal stomach. The histogenesis of the MGM in Barrett's mucosa in humans (that is Barrett's mucosa type 2) remains elusive. Therefore the baboon might be an important animal model for studying the histogenesis of Barrett's mucosa with MGM in humans, a recognized pre-cancerous lesion."
Diversity of microsporidia (Fungi: Microsporidia) among captive great apes in European zoos and African sanctuaries: evidence for zoonotic transmission?,"['Sak, B', 'Kvac, M', 'Petrzelkova, K', 'Kvetonova, D', 'Pomajbikova, K', 'Mulama, M', 'Kiyang, J', 'Modry, D']",FOLIA PARASITOLOGICA,NA,JUN 2011,9,"Two hundred and seventeen captive great apes (150 chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes; 14 bonobos, Pan paniscus; 53 western gorillas, Gorilla gorilla) and 20 personnel from thirteen European zoos and two African sanctuaries were sampled and examined in order to determine the occurrence of Enterocytozoon bieneusi and species of Encephalitozoon in faecal specimens and to compare the epidemiological situation between zoos and sanctuaries. Microsporidia were detected at all sampling sites. Sequence analyses of ITS amplicons generated by using microsporidia-specific primers determined the presence of microsporidia in 87 samples including 13 humans; since two cases of simultaneous occurrence of Encephalitozoon cuniculi and Enterocytozoon bieneusi were identified, 89 full-length ITS sequences were obtained, namely 78 Encephalitozoon cuniculi genotype 1, five E. cuniculi genotype II, two E. hellem 1A and four Enterocytozoon bieneusi. No Encephalitozoon intestinalis-positive samples were identified. This is the first report of Encephalitozoon species and Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotypes in captive great apes kept under various conditions and the first record of natural infection with E. hellem in great apes. A comparison of zoos and sanctuaries showed a significantly higher prevalence of microsporidia in sanctuaries (P < 0.001), raising a question about the factors affecting the occurrence of microsporidia in epidemiologically and sanitarily comparable types of facilities."

Evolution of invasive placentation with special reference to non-human primates,"['Carter, AM', 'Pijnenborg, R']",BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH CLINICAL OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY,10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2010.10.010,JUN 2011,26,"It is now possible to view human placentation in an evolutionary context because advances in molecular phylogenetics provide a reliable scenario for the evolution of mammals. Perhaps the most striking finding is the uniqueness of human placenta. The lower primates have non-invasive placentae and even tarsiers and New World monkeys show restricted trophoblast invasion. Moreover, a truly villous placenta occurs only in Old World monkeys and great apes. The two latter groups of haplorhine primates show varying degrees of trophoblast-uterine interaction, including differences in the extent of decidualization, formation and disintegration of a cytotrophoblastic shell, degree of interstitial trophoblast invasion and depth of trophoblast invasion into spiral arteries. Recently, the occurrence of human-like deep invasion was confirmed in gorillas and chimpanzees. As the still enigmatic disease of pre-eclampsia also occurs in these species, such information may reveal the evolutionary roots of this disease of impaired maternal-fetal interaction.

Assessing Endocranial Variations in Great Apes and Humans Using 3D Data From Virtual Endocasts,"['Bienvenu, T', 'Guy, F', 'Coudyzer, W', 'Gilissen, E', 'Roualdes, G', 'Vignaud, P', 'Brunet, M', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFRICANUS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21488,JUN 2011,13,"Modern humans are characterized by their large, complex, and specialized brain. Human brain evolution can be addressed through direct evidence provided by fossil hominid endocasts (i.e. paleoneurology), or through indirect evidence of extant species comparative neurology. Here we use the second approach, providing an extant comparative framework for hominid paleoneurological studies. We explore endocranial size and shape differences among great apes and humans, as well as between sexes. We virtually extracted 72 endocasts, sampling all extant great ape species and modern humans, and digitized 37 landmarks on each for 3D generalized Procrustes analysis. All species can be differentiated by their endocranial shape. Among great apes, endocranial shapes vary from short (orangutans) to long (gorillas), perhaps in relation to different facial orientations. Endocranial shape differences among African apes are partly allometric. Major endocranial traits distinguishing humans from great apes are endocranial globularity, reflecting neurological reorganization, and features linked to structural responses to posture and bipedal locomotion. Human endocasts are also characterized by posterior location of foramina rotunda relative to optic canals, which could be correlated to lesser subnasal prognathism compared to living great apes. Species with larger brains (gorillas and humans) display greater sexual dimorphism in endocranial size, while sexual dimorphism in endocranial shape is restricted to gorillas, differences between males and females being at least partly due to allometry. Our study of endocranial variations in extant great apes and humans provides a new comparative dataset for studies of fossil hominid endocasts. Am J Phys Anthropol 145:231-246, 2011.

"A Comparative Study on Testicular Microstructure and Relative Sperm Production in Gorillas, Chimpanzees, and Orangutans","['Fujii-Hanamoto, H', 'Matsubayashi, K', 'Nakano, M', 'Kusunoki, H', 'Enomoto, T']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20930,JUN 2011,4,"We performed histological analyses for comparing testicular microstructure between the gorilla, chimpanzee, and orangutan. Testicular samples were obtained by autopsy or biopsy from 10 gorillas, 11 chimpanzees, and 7 orangutans from several zoos and institutes. The seminiferous epithelia were thick in the chimpanzee and orangutan but thin in the gorilla. Leydig cells in the interstitial tissue were abundant in the gorilla. The acrosomic system was extremely well developed in the orangutans. Our study reveals that the cycle of seminiferous epithelium in orangutan testis can be divided into ten stages, whereas that in human, chimpanzee, and gorilla testes can be divided into only six stages. Phylogenetic analyses of the number of divisions may indicate that the seminiferous epithelium of our common ancestor has changed since the orangutan diverged from it. Furthermore, we performed comparative analyses of testicular microstructure to estimate relative sperm production among these three animals, and proposed a new indicator (namely the spermatogenic index, SI) closely related to sperm production. The SI indicated that a chimpanzee usually produces about 223 times more sperm than a gorilla and about 14 times more than an orangutan. Our data demonstrate the significance of the SI for estimating sperm production, thus aiding our understanding of the reproductive strategy as well as testis weight and relative testis size in investigated primates.

However, we generally lack an understanding of how such variability may be linked to concomitant demographic variation among groups or populations of the same species, particularly in regard to large-bodied and wide-ranging species with high ecological flexibility, such as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We compared the feeding ecology of chimpanzees inhabiting 2 sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda that differ 3-fold in chimpanzee density and support notably different plant communities. Chimpanzees at Ngogo, a site with the largest known chimpanzee community and unusually high chimpanzee density, spent a significantly lower percentage of time resting (and pregnant and lactating females spent more time feeding), incorporated higher percentages of ripe fruit in their diet, had lower dietary diversity values, and had shorter and less variable average patch residency times than did their counterparts at the nearby Kanyawara site, which supports a relatively low density of chimpanzees. In addition, feeding party size was significantly and positively related to feeding patch size at Ngogo, but not at Kanyawara. Together these findings aid in explaining the noted disparity in chimpanzee community size and density between Ngogo and Kanyawara by suggesting that the diet of Ngogo chimpanzees is of higher overall quality than that of Kanyawara chimpanzees. They also highlight the potentially profound influence of even small-scale habitat heterogeneity on the ecology of primates. Researchers must take such influences into account when attempting to draw conclusions about species- or population-level characteristics."
CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF A WESTERN LOWLAND GORILLA (GORILLA GORILLA GORILLA) WITH A CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY DEVICE,"['Rush, EM', 'Ogburn, AL', 'Monroe, D']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,JUN 2011,1,"A 24-yr-old, male western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) was diagnosed with congestive heart failure using transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiology. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III was assigned to the severity of the condition. Over 16 mo, this progressed to NYHA Class IV despite increasing medical therapy. Repeated evaluations suggested that implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy device with a defibrillator (CRT-D) could benefit this animal based on clinical signs and underlying evidence of dyssynchrony and suspected fibrotic myocardial disease. Surgical implantation of leads into the right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle was accomplished. The CRT-D device was placed under the thoracic pectoral muscles during an initial surgical procedure. Improvement in the gorilla's clinical condition after implantation of the CRT-D device was immediate and dramatic. Subsequent scanning of the device was accomplished through operant conditioning. The data from these device interrogations included stored and real-time cardiac data, which were used to minimize recognized environmental stressors and change device settings. Over 4 yr, case management was critical to successful device use in treatment of the clinical disease. This involved medications, training for device interrogation, exercise to increase activity and improve body condition, and phlebotomy attempts. Dietary management was necessary to manipulate caloric and sodium intake and encourage medication compliance. Cardiac resynchronization therapy device implantation, although requiring specialized equipment and surgical skill, appears to be a viable option for treatment of fibrosing cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction in gorillas refractory to medical management. In addition to treatment, this device provides cardiovascular data at rest that could allow for early diagnosis and treatment of gorillas with this and other cardiac conditions in the future. This describes the comprehensive medical, husbandry, and training techniques necessary to successfully manage this intense clinical case in conjunction with intracardiac device therapy."

On the basis of observable morphology and available comparative metrics, DNH 109 is definitively hominin and is the smallest African Plio-Pleistocene australopith ulna yet recovered. Mediolateral and anteroposterior dimensions of the proximal diaphysis immediately distal to the in. brachialis sulcus in DNH 109 yield an elliptical area (pi/4 *m-l*a-p) that is smaller than the A.L. 333-38 Australopithecus afarensis subadult from Hadar. Given the unusually broad mediolateral / anteroposterior diaphyseal proportions distal to the brachialis sulcus, the osseous development of the medial and lateral borders of the sulcus, and the overall size of the specimen relative to comparative infant, juvenile, subadult and adult comparative hominid ulnae (Gorilla, Pan and Homo), it is probable that DNH 109 samples an australopith of probable juvenile age at death. As a result of the fragmentary state of preservation and absence of association with taxonomically diagnostic craniodental remains, DNH 109 cannot be provisionally assigned to any particular hominin genus (Paranthropus or Homo) at present. Nonetheless, DNH 109 increases our known sample of available Plio-Pleistocene subadult early hominin postcrania."
Strategies for the Use of Fallback Foods in Apes,"['Harrison, ME', 'Marshall, AJ']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-010-9487-2,JUN 2011,28,"Researchers have suggested that fallback foods (FBFs) shape primate food processing adaptations, whereas preferred foods drive harvesting adaptations, and that the dietary importance of FBFs is central in determining the expression of a variety of traits. We examine these hypotheses in extant apes. First, we compare the nature and dietary importance of FBFs used by each taxon. FBF importance appears greatest in gorillas, followed by chimpanzees and siamangs, and least in orangutans and gibbons (bonobos are difficult to place). Next, we compare 20 traits among taxa to assess whether the relative expression of traits expected for consumption of FBFs matches their observed dietary importance. Trait manifestation generally conforms to predictions based on dietary importance of FBFs. However, some departures from predictions exist, particularly for orang-utans, which express relatively more food harvesting and processing traits predicted for consuming large amounts of FBFs than expected based on observed dietary importance. This is probably due to the chemical, mechanical, and phenological properties of the apes' main FBFs, in particular high importance of figs for chimpanzees and hylobatids, compared to use of bark and leaves-plus figs in at least some Sumatran populations-by orang-utans. This may have permitted more specialized harvesting adaptations in chimpanzees and hylobatids, and required enhanced processing adaptations in orang-utans. Possible intercontinental differences in the availability and quality of preferred and FBFs may also be important. Our analysis supports previous hypotheses suggesting a critical influence of the dietary importance and quality of FBFs on ape ecology and, consequently, evolution."
"Sympatric Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Loango National Park, Gabon: Dietary Composition, Seasonality, and Intersite Comparisons","['Head, JS', 'Boesch, C', 'Makaga, L', 'Robbins, MM']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-011-9499-6,JUN 2011,22,"Dietary overlap of sympatric apes is complex and understudied, but its examination is essential to further our understanding of species distribution, abundance, and community ecology. Over 3 yr we studied food availability and dietary composition of central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Loango National Park, Gabon. We predicted that living in a habitat dominated by mature forest with sparse terrestrial herbaceous vegetation would lead to an increase in frugivory by gorillas, resulting in increased dietary overlap between the 2 ape species vs. other sites, but that chimpanzees would remain more frugivorous than gorillas. Through fecal analysis we measured overlap in fruit consumption between the 2 species on a bimonthly basis using the Renkonens method. Mean overlap was 27.5% but varied greatly seasonally, ranging between 0.3% and 69%, indicating that when examined on a finer scale, the degree of overlap appears much lower than at other study sites. In contrast to studies elsewhere, there was not a positive correlation between rainfall and fruit availability in Loango, and the long dry season was a period of high fruit production. As observed elsewhere, we found a positive correlation between fruit consumption and fruit availability for both chimpanzees and gorillas and we found that chimpanzees were more frugivorous than gorillas. A very low availability of herbs did not lead to increased frugivory by gorillas nor increased overlap between the 2 ape species vs. other field sites. We conclude that forest composition, fruit availability, and dietary variability of sympatric species can vary greatly between locations, and that chimpanzees and gorillas can adapt to primary forest with little undergrowth, where they concentrate their diet on fruit and leaves."
Left-hand Preference for a Complex Manual Task in a Population of Wild Siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus),"['Morino, L']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-011-9501-3,JUN 2011,2,"Many hypotheses have been proposed linking the emergence of lateralized activities-such as handedness-in primates, with hemispheric specialization and the evolution of complex communication such as human language. Although data to test these ideas are rapidly accumulating for many primate taxa, some species are still largely unexplored, especially under natural conditions. I present the first data on a population of wild siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus), highly arboreal small apes. Preference for the left hand is shown both at the individual and population levels for a complex manual task: collecting and drinking water from tree holes. There was no difference in hand preference between males and females, and immature individuals showed more variable patterns than adults. These results are consistent with the postural origins theory, allow a new interpretation of the findings of comparable studies, and indicate a useful behavior for future investigations of laterality in wild primates."

Proximate Composition of Milk From Free-Ranging Mountain Gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei),"['Whittier, CA', 'Milligan, LA', 'Nutter, FB', 'Cranfield, MR', 'Power, ML']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20363,MAY-JUN 2011,2,"Published data on milk composition for nonhuman primates, especially great apes, are lacking. Milk composition data are important for understanding the physiology and evolution of mammalian milk production, as well as the nutritional requirements of infants. For many primate species these data have added relevance because of the need to hand raise infants orphaned by poaching or separated from their mothers in captivity. The proximate composition (dry matter (DM), protein, fat, sugar) of free-ranging mountain gorilla (MG) (Gorilla beringei beringei) milk was characterized from samples (N = 10) collected opportunistically during field procedures. The mean values for mid-lactation (1-50 months) milk samples from healthy MGs (N = 7) were: 10.7% DM, 1.9% fat, 1.4% crude protein, 6.8% sugar, and 0.53 kcal/g. These results are lower in fat and total energy than most other Hominidae, including humans. One early-lactation sample was high in protein content while the composition of two samples from gorillas with poor health and suspected poor milk quality both deviated from the normal, mid-lactation pattern. This survey adds to the data available for primate milk composition and suggests that wild MG infants normally consume milk that is lower in fat and total energy than human milk.

Cacchione and Krist (2004) examined chimpanzees' intuitions about support relations with the violation-of-expectation task. They reported that the chimpanzees possessed intuitions about support, but their intuitions differed from those of humans in part; they were sensitive to ""contact/no-contact"" and ""amount of contact"" but not ""type of contact"" rule. To further explore intuitions about support in nonhuman primates, we conducted similar experiments on monkeys (Japanese monkeys) and apes (chimpanzees). In three experiments, we presented physically possible and impossible events of different support relations to the participants and measured their looking times. The results reveal that the chimpanzees and monkeys detect the violations of ""contact/no-contact"" and ""amount of contact"" but not ""type of contact"" variable. Therefore, the apes and monkeys possess similar intuitions; however, these intuitions differ in part from those of humans. The present study provides new and corroborative evidence of intuitions about support in nonhuman primates. However, this again leads to the question of distinctive understanding about support relations among primate species."

Participants watched a classic inattentional blindness video (Simons & Chabris, 1999) and were instructed to count passes among basketball players, wherein 58% noticed the unexpected: a person wearing a gorilla suit. When participants were accurate with their pass counts, individuals with higher working memory capacity were more likely to report seeing the gorilla (67%) than those with lesser working memory capacity (36%). These results suggest that variability in attentional control is a potential mechanism underlying the apparent modulation of inattentional blindness across individuals."
The gaze that grooms: contribution of social factors to the evolution of primate eye morphology,"['Kobayashi, H', 'Hashiya, K']",EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR,10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.08.003,MAY 2011,8,"There is a wide variation in the external eye morphology across species in primates, which is considered to reflect adaptation to ecological factors such as body size and habitat type. However, little attention has been paid to the contribution of social factors to the evolution of primate eye morphology. To explore this, we analyzed correlations among eye morphology, social factors (neocortex ratio and group size) and other factors (habitat type and body mass) in 30 living primate species including humans, using phylogenetically independent contrasts. The results indicated that parameters of primate eye morphology correlate with group size and neocortex ratio (Study 1). Further analysis of behavior indicated that the proportion of scanning with eyeball movement alone per total scanning correlated with group size and neocortex ratio (Study 2). The results support the view that the scanning with independent eyeball movement and its morphological basis is an adaptation to larger social groups. Communicative functions of the gaze signal other than the expression of aggression, observed in some primate species, may be based on features related to eye morphology. Furthermore, the evolution of a contact-free, social grooming function of gaze, especially predominant in humans, may reflect one extreme case of this kind of adaptation, which we call the ""gaze-grooming"" hypothesis.

Hand preferences for coordinated bimanual actions in 777 great apes: Implications for the evolution of handedness in Hominins,"['Hopkins, WD', 'Phillips, KA', 'Bania, A', 'Calcutt, SE', 'Gardner, M', 'Russell, J', 'Schaeffer, J', 'Lonsdorf, EV', 'Ross, SR', 'Schapiro, SJ']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.12.008,MAY 2011,48,"Whether or not nonhuman primates exhibit population-level handedness remains a topic of considerable scientific debate. Here, we examined handedness for coordinated bimanual actions in a sample of 777 great apes including chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans. We found population-level right-handedness in chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas, but left-handedness in orangutans. Directional biases in handedness were consistent across independent samples of apes within each genus. We suggest that, contrary to previous claims, population-level handedness is evident in great apes but differs among species as a result of ecological adaptations associated with posture and locomotion. We further suggest that historical views of nonhuman primate handedness have been too anthropocentric, and we advocate for a larger evolutionary framework for the consideration of handedness and other aspects of hemispheric specialization among primates.

Primates do not spontaneously use shape properties for object individuation: a competence or a performance problem?,"['Mendes, N', 'Rakoczy, H', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-010-0375-0,MAY 2011,6,"Several recent studies have documented that non-human primates can individuate objects according to property and/or kind information in much the same way as human infants do from around one year of age when they begin to acquire language. Some studies suggest, however, that only some properties are used for the individuation of food items: color, but not shape. The present study investigated whether these findings reveal a true competence problem with shape properties in the food domain or whether they merely reveal a performance problem (e.g., lack of attention to shapes). We tested 25 great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas) in two food individuation tasks. We manipulated subjects' experience with differences in color and shape properties of food items. Results indicated (i) that all subjects, regardless of their prior experience, solved the color-based object individuation task and (ii) that only the group with previous experience with different shape properties succeeded in the shape-based individuation task. Great apes can thus be primed to take shape into account for individuating food objects, and this results clearly speaks in favor of a performance (rather than a competence) problem in using shape for object individuation of food items."
Focus on the essential: all great apes know when others are being attentive,"['Tempelmann, S', 'Kaminski, J', 'Liebal, K']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0378-5,MAY 2011,25,"When begging for food, all great ape species are sensitive to a human's attention. However, studies investigating which cues are relevant for chimpanzees to assess the attentional state of others have produced highly inconsistent results. Some have suggested chimpanzees differentiate attention based on the status of the face or even the eyes, while others have indicated that body posture alone is the relevant cue. Kaminski et al. (Anim Cogn 7:216-223, 2004) compared the behaviour of chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans while begging for food from a human experimenter who systematically varied his face and body orientation. Their results indicated that both factors, face and body orientation, affect apes' begging behaviour. The authors claimed that while body orientation provides information about the experimenter's general disposition to offer food, the visibility of the face provides information about the human's attentional state. In the current study, we tested this hypothesis with all four great apes species. However, unlike Kaminski et al. (Anim Cogn 7:216-223, 2004), the experimenter was able to hand over food regardless of body orientation. The results show that as soon as the offering of the food was no longer restricted, the orientation of the face became the key factor. Therefore, we present the first evidence that all great ape species are able to assess the attentional state of a recipient based on the orientation of the face."
Timing of ectocranial suture activity in Gorilla gorilla as related to cranial volume and dental eruption,"['Cray, J', 'Cooper, GM', 'Mooney, MP', 'Siegel, MI']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2011.01358.x,MAY 2011,6,"Research has shown that Pan and Homo have similar ectocranial suture synostosis patterns and a similar suture ontogeny (relative timing of suture fusion during the species ontogeny). This ontogeny includes patency during and after neurocranial expansion with a delayed bony response associated with adaptation to biomechanical forces generated by mastication. Here we investigate these relationships for Gorilla by examining the association among ectocranial suture morphology, cranial volume (as a proxy for neurocranial expansion) and dental development (as a proxy for the length of time that it has been masticating hard foods and exerting such strains on the cranial vault) in a large sample of Gorilla gorilla skulls. Two-hundred and fifty-five Gorilla gorilla skulls were examined for ectocranial suture closure status, cranial volume and dental eruption. Regression models were calculated for cranial volumes by suture activity, and Kendall's tau (a non-parametric measure of association) was calculated for dental eruption status by suture activity. Results suggest that, as reported for Pan and Homo, neurocranial expansion precedes suture synostosis activity. Here, Gorilla was shown to have a strong relationship between dental development and suture activity (synostosis). These data are suggestive of suture fusion extending further into ontogeny than brain expansion, similar to Homo and Pan. This finding allows for the possibility that masticatory forces influence ectocranial suture morphology."
Detection and Genetic Characterization of Enteroviruses Circulating among Wild Populations of Chimpanzees in Cameroon: Relationship with Human and Simian Enteroviruses,"['Harvala, H', 'Sharp, CP', 'Ngole, EM', 'Delaporte, E', 'Peeters, M', 'Simmonds, P']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.02285-10,MAY 2011,29,"Enteroviruses (EVs), members of the family Picornaviridae, are a genetically and antigenically diverse range of viruses causing acute infections in humans and several Old World monkey (OWM) species. Despite their known wide distribution in primates, nothing is currently known about the occurrence, frequency, and genetic diversity of enteroviruses infecting apes. To investigate this, 27 chimpanzee and 27 gorilla fecal samples collected from undisturbed jungle areas with minimal human contact in Cameroon were screened for EVs. Four chimpanzee samples were positive, but none of the gorilla samples were positive. Genetic characterization of the VP1, VP4, and partial VP2 genes, the 5' untranslated region, and partial 3Dpol sequences enabled chimpanzee-derived EVs to be identified as (i) the species A type, EV76, (ii) a new species D type assigned as EV111, along with a human isolate from the Democratic Republic of Congo previously described by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses, and (iii) a new species B type (assigned as EV110) most closely related to, although a distinct type from, the SA5 isolate recovered from a vervet monkey. The identification of EVs infecting chimpanzees related to those circulating in human and OWM populations provides evidence for cross-species transmission of EVs between primates. However, the direction of transfer and the existence of primate sources of zoonotic enterovirus infections in humans require further investigation of population exposure and more extensive characterization of EVs circulating in wild ape populations."
Death Among Geladas (Theropithecus gelada): A Broader Perspective on Mummified Infants and Primate Thanatology,"['Fashing, PJ', 'Nguyen, N', 'Barry, TS', 'Goodale, CB', 'Burke, RJ', 'Jones, SCZ', 'Kerby, JT', 'Lee, LM', 'Nurmi, NO', 'Venkataraman, VV']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20902,MAY 2011,10,"Despite intensive study in humans, responses to dying and death have been a neglected area of research in other social mammals, including nonhuman primates. Two recent reports [Anderson JR, Gillies A, Lock LC. 2010. Pan thanatology. Current Biology 20: R349-R351; Biro D, Humle T, Koops K, Souse C, Hayashi M, Matsuzawa T. 2010. Chimpanzee mothers at Bossou, Guinea carry the mummified remains of their dead infants. Current Biology 20: R351-R352] offered exciting new insights into behavior toward dying and dead conspecifics in our closest living relatives-chimpanzees. Here, we provide a comparative perspective on primate thanatology using observations from a more distant human relative-gelada monkeys (Theropithecus gelada)-and discuss how gelada reactions to dead and dying groupmates differ from those recently reported for chimpanzees. Over a 3.75-year study period, we observed 14 female geladas at Guassa, Ethiopia carrying dead infants from 1 hr to >= 48 days after death. Dead infants were carried by their mothers, other females in their group, and even by females belonging to other groups. Like other primate populations in which extended (410 days) infant carrying after death has been reported, geladas at Guassa experience an extreme climate for primates, creating conditions which may favor slower rates of decomposition of dead individuals. We also witnessed the events leading up to the deaths of two individuals and the responses by groupmates to these dying individuals. Our results suggest that while chimpanzee mothers are not unique among primates in carrying their dead infants for long periods, seemingly ""compassionate"" caretaking behavior toward dying groupmates may be unique to chimpanzees among nonhuman primates (though it remains unknown whether such ""compassionate"" behavior occurs outside captivity).

It hosts many different animal species, including the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus). Very little is known about the ecology of chimpanzees inhabiting this area. The main aims of this study were to evaluate chimpanzee nesting behavior, define trends of habitat use, and estimate chimpanzee density in four separate forests by applying the marked nest counts methodology. From the 287 new nests counted, 92% were built in oil-palm trees with a significantly higher frequency of nests in the forest edge than in forest cores. Differences in nest detection rates were observed in the four monitored forests, with two forests being more important for chimpanzee's nesting demands. The number of nests documented in the forests seemed to be correlated with the frequency of other signs of chimpanzee activity. Although chimpanzees selected nests on the forest edge, they were most frequently observed in forest core areas. Constraints associated with estimating chimpanzee density through oil-palm nest counting are discussed. Am. J. Primatol. 73: 485-497, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Historical sampling reveals dramatic demographic changes in western gorilla populations,"['Thalmann, O', 'Wegmann, D', 'Spitzner, M', 'Arandjelovic, M', 'Guschanski, K', 'Leuenberger, C', 'Bergl, RA', 'Vigilant, L']",BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1186/1471-2148-11-85,APR 1 2011,20,"Background: Today many large mammals live in small, fragmented populations, but it is often unclear whether this subdivision is the result of long-term or recent events. Demographic modeling using genetic data can estimate changes in long-term population sizes while temporal sampling provides a way to compare genetic variation present today with that sampled in the past. In order to better understand the dynamics associated with the divergences of great ape populations, these analytical approaches were applied to western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and in particular to the isolated and Critically Endangered Cross River gorilla subspecies (G. g. diehli).

Results: We used microsatellite genotypes from museum specimens and contemporary samples of Cross River gorillas to infer both the long-term and recent population history. We find that Cross River gorillas diverged from the ancestral western gorilla population similar to 17,800 years ago (95% HDI: 760, 63,245 years). However, gene flow ceased only similar to 420 years ago (95% HDI: 200, 16,256 years), followed by a bottleneck beginning similar to 320 years ago (95% HDI: 200, 2,825 years) that caused a 60 fold decrease in the effective population size of Cross River gorillas. Direct comparison of heterozygosity estimates from museum and contemporary samples suggests a loss of genetic variation over the last 100 years.

Conclusions: The composite history of western gorillas could plausibly be explained by climatic oscillations inducing environmental changes in western equatorial Africa that would have allowed gorilla populations to expand over time but ultimately isolate the Cross River gorillas, which thereafter exhibited a dramatic population size reduction. The recent decrease in the Cross River population is accordingly most likely attributable to increasing anthropogenic pressure over the last several hundred years. Isolation of diverging populations with prolonged concomitant gene flow, but not secondary admixture, appears to be a typical characteristic of the population histories of African great apes, including gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos."

PBoV was predicted to contain three potential ORFs encoding the non-structural protein NS1, the characteristic NP1 protein and the capsid protein VP1/VP2, with an organization similar to that of known bocaviruses. Interestingly, the NS1 gene of PBoV was more similar in length to the homogeneous gene found in HBoV than to those of other known bocaviruses. In addition, highly conserved unique splice-donor and -acceptor sites were identified in the NS1 gene of HBoV and PBoV."

Evolutionary Glycomics: Characterization of Milk Oligosaccharides in Primates,"['Tao, NA', 'Wu, SA', 'Kim, J', 'An, HJ', 'Hinde, K', 'Power, ML', 'Gagneux, P', 'German, JB', 'Lebrilla, CB']",JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH,10.1021/pr1009367,APR 2011,41,"Free oligosaccharides are abundant components of mammalian milk and have primary roles as prebiotic compounds, in immune defense, and in brain development. A mass spectrometry-based technique is applied to profile milk oligosaccharides from apes (chimpanzee, gorilla, and siamang), new world monkeys (golden lion tamarin and common marmoset), and an old world monkey (rhesus). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the patterns of primate milk oligosaccharide composition from a phylogenetic perspective to assess the extent to which the compositions of HMOs derives from ancestral primate patterns as opposed to more recent evolutionary events. Milk oligosaccharides were quantitated by nanoflow liquid chromatography on chip-based devices. The relative abundances of fucosylated and sialylated milk oligosaccharides in primates were also determined. For a systematic and comprehensive study of evolutionary patterns of milk oligosaccharides, cluster analysis of primate milk was performed using the chromatographic profile. In general, the oligosaccharides in primate milk, including humans, are more complex and exhibit greater diversity compared to the ones in nonprimate milk. A detailed comparison of the oligosaccharides across evolution revealed nonsequential developmental pattern, that is, that primate milk oligosaccharides do not necessarily cluster according to the primate phylogeny. This report represents the first comprehensive and quantitative effort to profile and elucidate the structures of free milk oligosaccharides so that they can be related to glycan function in different primates."
Comparative studies of placentation and immunology in non-human primates suggest a scenario for the evolution of deep trophoblast invasion and an explanation for human pregnancy disorders,"['Carter, AM']",REPRODUCTION,10.1530/REP-10-0530,APR 2011,18,"Deep trophoblast invasion in the placental bed has been considered the hallmark of human pregnancy. It occurs by two routes, interstitial and endovascular, and results in transformation of the walls of the spiral arteries as they traverse the decidua and the inner third of the myometrium. Disturbances in this process are associated with reproductive disorders such preeclampsia. In contrast, trophoblast invasion in Old World monkeys occurs only by the endovascular route and seldom reaches the myometrium. Recently, it was shown that this pattern is maintained in gibbons, but that the human arrangement also occurs in chimpanzee and gorilla. There is an interesting parallel with results from placental immunology regarding the evolution of the major histocompatability complex class I antigen HLA-C and its cognate receptors. HLA-C is not present in Old World monkeys or gibbons. It emerged in the orangutan and became polymorphic in the lineage leading to gorilla, bonobo, chimpanzee, and human. Interaction between HLA-C1 and HLA-C2 on the surface of trophoblast and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) expressed by uterine natural killer cells are important regulators of trophoblast invasion. Evolution of this system in great apes may have been one prerequisite for deep trophoblast invasion but seems to have come at a price. The evidence now suggests that certain combinations of maternal genotype for KIRs and fetal genotype for HLA-C imply an increased risk of preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and recurrent abortion. The fetal genotype is in part derived from the father providing an explanation for the paternal contribution to reproductive disorders. Reproduction (2011) 141 391-396"
Great Apes Use Weight as a Cue to Find Hidden Food,"['Schrauf, C', 'Call, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20899,APR 2011,8,"Bonobos (Pan paniscus; n = 5), orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus abelii; n = 6), and a gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla; n = 1) were presented with two opaque cups, one empty and one baited (containing two bananas). Subjects had to independently gain weight information about the contents of the cups to find the hidden food. Six apes attained above chance level within a total of 16 trials. Successful subjects spontaneously adopted the method of successively lifting the cups and thus comparing their weight before making a choice. Prior to testing, these apes had participated in a weight discrimination task. To rule out that a subject's good performance was influenced by previous experience in weight experiments, we ran a second test in which the same task was presented to a group of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes; n = 9) who were naive to weight experiments. These subjects also participated in an additional test condition in which the same problem was presented based on learning to associate arbitrary visual stimuli. The results show that experience did not affect performance because the nine naive subjects were equally able to find the food when the task stimuli held a causal relation (i.e. weight indicates the hidden food). Interestingly, only one of the naive subjects solved the task when the task elements held an arbitrary relation (i.e. certain visual pattern indicates food). Our results confirm previous findings that apes perform better in problems grounded on causal compared to arbitrary relations. Am. J. Primatol. 73: 323-334, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Previous studies conducted during the 1970s when groups contained one to three adult males concluded that male-immature relationships were likely to be a form of low-cost paternal investment [Stewart, Mountain gorillas: three decades of research at Karisoke. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2001]. We evaluated whether this hypothesis still held in groups containing six to nine adult males, or if male-immature relationships might serve other functions (e. g. mating effort, kin selection, or alliance building). Overall, we found that immatures spent the most time near, and interacted most with, the alpha silverback. These behaviors peaked during the period when infants were still quite vulnerable but increasing their independence from their mothers. Such findings suggest that parenting effort remains the primary function of male-immature relationships; however, there is some evidence for the mating effort hypothesis as well. Am. J.

Intracardiac Thrombosis and Aortic Dissecting Aneurysms in Mustached Tamarins (Saguinus mystax) with Cardiomyopathy,"['Gozalo, AS', 'Ragland, DR', 'StClaire, MC', 'Elkins, WR', 'Michaud, CR']",COMPARATIVE MEDICINE,NA,APR 2011,1,"Spontaneous intracardiac thrombosis is rarely reported in animals, particularly nonhuman primates. The finding of 2 cases of intracardiac thrombi in mustached tamarins (Saguinus mystax) that died as a consequence of congestive heart failure prompted us to do a retrospective study to determine the frequency of this condition. Clinical records, necropsy reports, and tissues from 60 mustached tamarins that died or were euthanized between 1996 and 2009 were reviewed. Of the 60 monkeys whose cases were reviewed, 10 (16.6%) had intracardiac thrombi, and 4 (6.6%) had dissecting aortic aneurysms. Of the 10 animals with intracardiac thrombosis, 3 had left ventricular involvement alone; 4 monkeys had thrombi only in the right ventricle, and the remaining 3 animals exhibited thrombi in both ventricles. Myocardial fibrosis and chronic renal disease were common findings in affected animals. The causes of the intracardiac thrombosis in the tamarins in the present study are not known, but the clinical signs and gross and microscopic lesions suggest that congestive heart failure secondary to cardiomyopathy is the primary contributor. In addition, the cause of the aortic dissecting aneurysms in the tamarins in this study is not known. Further studies are required to determine whether factors including aortic curvature, genetic background, or hypertension alone or in combination play a role. To our knowledge, the current retrospective study is the first report of intracardiac thrombosis and aortic aneurysms in mustached tamarins."
Alcances y limitaciones del método etnográfico aplicado al estudio de la cultura de los grandes simios en cautiverio,"['Becerril Tello, Merit Nefernefer']",Cuicuilco,NA,2011-04,0,"La cultura ha sido el tema esencial de la investigación antropológica, sin embargo, la primatología cultural ha retomado el concepto de cultura y el método etnográfico para entender las relaciones sociales y expresiones materiales de la cultura de los primates no humanos.

Potencial del uso de la primatología para interpretar la evidencia paleoantropológica,"['Terrazas Mata, Alejandro']",Cuicuilco,NA,2011-04,0,"Desde los años sesenta la primatología se ha desarrollado como una disciplina científica por derecho propio. Sin embargo, uno de los principales objetivos desde su origen ha sido proporcionar modelos sobre el comportamiento de los primates (sobre todo gorilas y chimpancés) que sirvan para interpretar la posible evolución del comportamiento de los homínidos. Se ha asumido, por lo general, que el chimpancé representa un ejemplo de cómo debió ser el ancestro común de los póngidos y los homínidos, y por lo tanto constituye una especie de ventana para conocer el origen de los comportamientos que hacen únicos a los seres humanos. Los modelos de la primatología se han empleado en la paleoantropología de tres maneras distintas: como fuente de metáforas de carácter anecdótico, como modelos de carácter heurístico para guiar la investigación, y como marco teórico para explicar los procesos de hominización y humanización. Las comparaciones entre el comportamiento de dos especies pueden tener dos bases de justificación: la homología y la analogía. La primera supone que los comportamientos observados se heredaron de un ancestro en común, mientras que en la analogía se asume que los rasgos observados se han podido desarrollar independientemente bajo la influencia de presiones selectivas similares. Las recientes publicaciones sobre los fósiles de algunos de los homínidos más antiguos (Ardipithecus ramidus) indican que una cantidad importante de rasgos anatómicos propios de los chimpancés se desarrollaron, de hecho, después de la separación de su linaje y el de los homínidos, por lo que es muy probable que su comportamiento también sea muy derivado, por lo que es muy cuestionable el uso de la comparación por homología. Por otra parte, desde un enfoque por analogía, los modelos de comportamiento de otros primates pueden ser todavía de gran utilidad, con la finalidad de entender las relaciones de los homínidos tempranos con el entorno y su posible vida social. Los primates son nuestros parientes más cercanos. Muchas de las especies que constituyen este orden están amenazadas o en peligro de extinción, su estudio se justifica por sí mismo, independientemente de su validez como fuente de comparaciones antropocentristas. La primatología se constituye, entonces, como un campo de investigación independiente y de gran importancia para nuestra sociedad."
Non-Invasive Genetic Monitoring of Wild Central Chimpanzees,"['Arandjelovic, M', 'Head, J', 'Rabanal, LI', 'Schubert, G', 'Mettke, E', 'Boesch, C', 'Robbins, MM', 'Vigilant, L']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0014761,MAR 15 2011,20,"Background: An assessment of population size and structure is an important first step in devising conservation and management plans for endangered species. Many threatened animals are elusive, rare and live in habitats that prohibit directly counting individuals. For example, a well-founded estimate of the number of great apes currently living in the wild is lacking. Developing methods to obtain accurate population estimates for these species is a priority for their conservation management. Genotyping non-invasively collected faecal samples is an effective way of evaluating a species' population size without disruption, and can also reveal details concerning population structure.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We opportunistically collected wild chimpanzee faecal samples for genetic capture-recapture analyses over a four-year period in a 132 km 2 area of Loango National Park, Gabon. Of the 444 samples, 46% yielded sufficient quantities of DNA for genotyping analysis and the consequent identification of 121 individuals. Using genetic capture-recapture, we estimate that 283 chimpanzees (range: 208-316) inhabited the research area between February 2005 and July 2008. Since chimpanzee males are patrilocal and territorial, we genotyped samples from males using variable Y-chromosome microsatellite markers and could infer that seven chimpanzee groups are present in the area. Genetic information, in combination with field data, also suggested the occurrence of repeated cases of intergroup violence and a probable group extinction.

Conclusions/Significance: The poor amplification success rate resulted in a limited number of recaptures and hence only moderate precision (38%, measured as the entire width of the 95% confidence interval), but this was still similar to the best results obtained using intensive nest count surveys of apes (40% to 63%). Genetic capture-recapture methods applied to apes can provide a considerable amount of novel information on chimpanzee population size and structure with minimal disturbance to the animals and represent a powerful complement to traditional field-based methods."
Aging in the Natural World: Comparative Data Reveal Similar Mortality Patterns Across Primates,"['Bronikowski, AM', 'Altmann, J', 'Brockman, DK', 'Cords, M', 'Fedigan, LM', 'Pusey, A', 'Stoinski, T', 'Morris, WF', 'Strier, KB', 'Alberts, SC']",SCIENCE,10.1126/science.1201571,MAR 11 2011,40,"Human senescence patterns-late onset of mortality increase, slow mortality acceleration, and exceptional longevity-are often described as unique in the animal world. Using an individual-based data set from longitudinal studies of wild populations of seven primate species, we show that contrary to assumptions of human uniqueness, human senescence falls within the primate continuum of aging; the tendency for males to have shorter life spans and higher age-specific mortality than females throughout much of adulthood is a common feature in many, but not all, primates; and the aging profiles of primate species do not reflect phylogenetic position. These findings suggest that mortality patterns in primates are shaped by local selective forces rather than phylogenetic history."

SURVIVAL AND MORPHOLOGIC CHANGES OF ENTODINIOMORPHID CILIATE TROGLODYTELLA ABRASSARTI IN CHIMPANZEE FECES,"['Profousova, I', 'Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Pomajbikova, K', 'Modry, D']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,MAR 2011,2,"Entodiniomorphid ciliates occur in the hindgut of both captive and wild African great apes. These ciliates do not form cysts, and therefore they are more susceptible for degradation. This present study focused on the survival, quantification, and decomposition processes of Troglodytella abrassarti trophozoites in the feces of captive chimpanzees. Fecal samples were examined using wet mounts and the merthiolate-iodine-formaldehyde concentration method, and the number of ciliates was expressed as ciliates per gram, which did not differ when examined from three different samples of the same feces. Trophozoites of T abrassarti survived 5-15 hr after defecation at 25 C under aerobic conditions. Decomposition of trophozoites began immediately after defecation; however, most of the trophozoites had a compact shape and visible cilia. Trophozoites, although without cilia, can be detected in the feces 55-65 hr after defecation, although most of the trophozoites were fragmented. The total number of ciliates in the sample started to decrease 35-55 hr after defecation. The absence of entodiniomorphid ciliates in fecal samples could not be caused by delayed feces fixation; instead, the absence was due to low sensitivity of coproscopic techniques. However, because of quick morphologic changes of trophozoites, accurate identification of ciliates in older samples may be difficult or even impossible."

Primate and ungulate abundance in response to multi-use zoning and human extractive activities in a Central African Reserve,"['Remis, MJ', 'Kpanou, JB']",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-2028.2010.01229.x,MAR 2011,14,"This study examines the abundance of key mammal species at the Dzanga-Sangha Reserve (RDS) in the Central African Republic with respect to conservation zoning and human activities in the reserve. RDS has been funded as an integrated conservation and development project since the mid-1980s. This study illustrates distinct wildlife responses to logging and hunting in RDS sectors that vary in protection and enforcement levels and the erosion of some critical animal communities across the RDS in the face of challenges of increasing human populations and flows of arms and ammunitions there. Our results show elephants (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) to be appreciably absent close to human settlements, and increasingly vulnerable to hunting in the more integrally protected sectors far from town. We have found that duikers (Cephalophus sp.) and western lowland gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla) make use of recently logged areas but are vulnerable to hunting there. These species are now most abundant farthest from human settlements. Our results have implications for the formulation of adaptive management plans that would benefit from the inclusion of nuanced understandings of site-specific and species-specific responses to microhabitats and the particular kinds of human extractive activities and challenges in the region.Resume

"Nest Site Ecology of the Cross River gorilla at the Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary, Cameroon, With Special Reference to Anthropogenic Influence","['De Vere, RA', 'Warren, Y', 'Nicholas, A', 'Mackenzie, ME', 'Higham, JP']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20886,MAR 2011,4,"The Cross River gorilla is the most endangered of all Great Apes. It is currently found in 14 apparently geographically separate and increasingly isolated populations, which face severe threats from habitat loss and the bushmeat trade. Recent years have seen greater efforts to conserve the Cross River gorilla across the landscape, but details of the ecology of individual populations that might help in conservation initiatives are lacking. Here, we report on the production of the first habitat map for the recently created Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary (KGS), Cameroon, and the results of an analysis of nest site preferences of the gorillas that live there. Qualitative vegetation assessments were made to assign various categories to the topstory and understory throughout the sanctuary, and nest sites constructed between January 2006 and March 2008 were re-visited and assessed for possible site preferences. The habitat map revealed significant anthropogenic impact, with only 57% of the KGS being relatively undisturbed primary forest. Analysis of nest sites showed that ground nests are constructed preferentially in the dry season, on precipitous slopes, in light gaps and clearings, with an understory of mixed herbs. Tree nests are predominantly built in the wet season, in primary forest with saplings as the preferred understory. Gorillas avoid nesting in grasslands and farms, which visibly fragment the remaining forest in the sanctuary. The results have implications for the conservation and management of the Cross River gorilla at KGS, and offer new insight into the nesting ecology of this subspecies. Am. J.

Complete nucleotide sequence and evolutionary analysis of a Gorilla foamy virus,"['Schulze, A', 'Lemey, P', 'Schubert, J', 'McClure, MO', 'Rethwilm, A', 'Bodem, J']",JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY,10.1099/vir.0.027011-0,MAR 2011,6,"To shed light on primate foamy virus (FV) evolution, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the gorilla simian foamy virus (SFVgor). Starting from a conserved region in the integrase (IN) domain of the pol gene we cloned the viral genome to the 5' and 3' LTR into plasmid vectors and elucidated its nucleotide sequence. The sequences of both LTRs were determined by nucleotide sequencing of separate PCR products from the primer-binding site or the bel region and LTRs. All protein motifs conserved among the primate FV were identified in SFVgor. Using phylogenetic analysis of the Gag, Pol and Env amino acid sequences, we demonstrate that SFVgor consistently clusters in accordance with a scenario of virus-host co-divergence."
Evolution of Metamorphism in Thymidylate Synthases Within the Primate Lineages,"['Luo, BB', 'Johnson, SR', 'Lebioda, L', 'Berger, SH']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-011-9433-8,MAR 2011,2,"Crystal structures of human thymidylate synthase (hTS) revealed that the protein exists in active and inactive conformations, defined by the position of a loop containing the active site nucleophile. TS is highly homologous among diverse species; however, the residue at position 163 (hTS) differs among species. Arginine at this position is predicted by structural modeling to enable conformational switching. Arginine or lysine is reported at this position in all mammals in the GenBank and Ensembl databases, with arginine reported in only primates. Sequence analysis of the TS gene of representative primates revealed that arginine occurs at this relative position in all primates except a representative of prosimians. Mutant human proteins were created with residues at position 163 that occur in TSs from prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Catalytic constants (k(cat)) of mutant enzymes were 45-149% of hTS, with the lysine mutant (R163K) exhibiting the highest k(cat). The effect of lysine substitution on solution structure and on ligand binding was investigated. R163K exhibited higher intrinsic fluorescence, a more negative molar ellipticity, and higher dissociation constants (K-d) for ligands that modulate protein conformation than hTS. Temperature effects on intrinsic fluorescence and catalytic activity of hTS and R163K are consistent with proteins populating different conformational states. The data indicate that the enzyme with arginine at the position corresponding to 163 (hTS) evolved after the divergence of prosimians and simians and that substitution of lysine by arginine confers unique structural and functional properties to the enzyme expressed in simian primates."
Aging Increases Inattentional Blindness to the Gorilla in Our Midst,"['Graham, ER', 'Burke, DM']",PSYCHOLOGY AND AGING,10.1037/a0020647,MAR 2011,9,"When engaged in an attention-demanding task, people are surprisingly vulnerable to inattentional blindness-the failure to notice an unexpected event. Two theories of cognitive aging, attentional capacity models and inhibitory deficit models, make opposite predictions about age differences in susceptibility to inattentional blindness. We tested these predictions using an inattentional blindness paradigm developed by Simons and Chabris (1999) and found that older adults were more likely to experience inattentional blindness than young adults. These results are compatible with attentional capacity models of cognitive aging but not with current inhibitory deficit models."
Responding to inequities: gorillas try to maintain their competitive advantage during play fights,"['van Leeuwen, EJC', 'Zimmermann, E', 'Ross, MD']",BIOLOGY LETTERS,10.1098/rsbl.2010.0482,FEB 23 2011,9,"Humans respond to unfair situations in various ways. Experimental research has revealed that non-human species also respond to unequal situations in the form of inequity aversions when they have the disadvantage. The current study focused on play fights in gorillas to explore for the first time, to our knowledge, if/how non-human species respond to inequities in natural social settings. Hitting causes a naturally occurring inequity among individuals and here it was specifically assessed how the hitters and their partners engaged in play chases that followed the hitting. The results of this work showed that the hitters significantly more often moved first to run away immediately after the encounter than their partners. These findings provide evidence that non-human species respond to inequities by trying to maintain their competitive advantages. We conclude that non-human primates, like humans, may show different responses to inequities and that they may modify them depending on if they have the advantage or the disadvantage."
Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) Fail a What-Where-When Task but Find Rewards by Using a Location-Based Association Strategy,"['Dekleva, M', 'Dufour, V', 'de Vries, H', 'Spruijt, BM', 'Sterck, EHM']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0016593,FEB 16 2011,4,"Recollecting the what-where-when of an episode, or episodic-like memory, has been established in corvids and rodents. In humans, a linkage between remembering the past and imagining the future has been recognised. While chimpanzees can plan for the future, their episodic-like memory has hardly been investigated. We tested chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with an adapted food-caching paradigm. They observed the baiting of two locations amongst four and chose one after a given delay (15 min, 1 h or 5 h). We used two combinations of food types, a preferred and a less preferred food that disappeared at different rates. The subjects had to base their choices on the time elapsed since baiting, and on their memory of which food was where. They could recover either their preferred food or the one that remained present. All animals failed to obtain the preferred or present foods above chance levels. They were like-wise unsuccessful at choosing baited cups above chance levels. The subjects, thus, failed to use any feature of the baiting events to guide their choices. Nonetheless, their choices were not random, but the result of a developed location-based association strategy. Choices in the second half of the study correlated with the rewards obtained at each location in the first half of the study, independent from the choices made for each location in the first half of the study. This simple location-based strategy yielded a fair amount of food. The animals' failure to remember the what-where-when in the presented set-up may be due to the complexity of the task, rather than an inability to form episodic-like memories, as they even failed to remember what was where after 15 minutes."

Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus downregulates FCER1 and HRH4 expression in human mast cells,"['Oksaharju, A', 'Kankainen, M', 'Kekkonen, RA', 'Lindstedt, KA', 'Kovanen, PT', 'Korpela, R', 'Miettinen, M']",WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY,10.3748/wjg.v17.i6.750,FEB 14 2011,20,"AIM: To investigate the effects of four probiotic bacteria and their combination on human mast cell gene expression using microarray analysis.

METHODS: Human peripheral-blood-derived mast cells were stimulated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) GG (LGG (R)), L. rhamnosus Lc705 (Lc705), Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanll JS (PJS) and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb12 (Bb12) and their combination for 3 or 24 h, and were subjected to global microarray analysis using an Affymetrix GeneChip (R) Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. The gene expression differences between unstimulated and bacteria-stimulated samples were further analyzed with GOrilla Gene Enrichment Analysis and Visualization Tool and MeV Multiexperiment Viewer-tool.

RESULTS: LGG and Lc705 were observed to suppress genes that encoded allergy-related high-affinity IgE receptor subunits alpha and gamma (FCER1A and FCER1G, respectively) and histamine H4 receptor. LGG, Lc705 and the combination of four probiotics had the strongest effect on the expression of genes involved in mast cell immune system regulation, and on several genes that encoded proteins with a pro-inflammatory impact, such as interleukin (IL)-8 and tumour necrosis factor alpha. Also genes that encoded proteins with anti-inflammatory functions, such as IL-10, were upregulated.

CONCLUSION: Certain probiotic bacteria might diminish mast cell allergy-related activation by downregulation of the expression of high-affinity IgE and histamine receptor genes, and by inducing a pro-inflammatory response. (C) 2011 Baishideng. All rights reserved."
"Inferential Reasoning by Exclusion in Great Apes, Lesser Apes, and Spider Monkeys","['Hill, A', 'Collier-Baker, E', 'Suddendorf, T']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0020867,FEB 2011,23,"Using the cups task, in which subjects are presented with limited visual or auditory information that can be used to deduce the location of a hidden reward, Call (2004) found prima facie evidence of inferential reasoning by exclusion in several great ape species. One bonobo (Pan paniscus) and two gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) appeared to make such inferences in both the visual and auditory domains. However, common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) were successful only in the visual domain, and Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) in neither. The present research built on this paradigm, and Experiment 1 yielded prima facie evidence of inference by exclusion in both domains for two common chimpanzees, and in the visual domain for two Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii). Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that two specific associative learning explanations could not readily account for these results. Because an important focus of the program of research was to assess the cognitive capacities of lesser apes (family Hylobatidae), we modified Call's original procedures to better suit their attentional and dispositional characteristics. In Experiment 1, testing was also attempted with three gibbon genera (Symphalangus, Nomascus, Hylobates), but none of the subjects completed the standard task. Further testing of three siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus) and a spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) using a faster method yielded prima facie evidence of inferential reasoning by exclusion in the visual domain among the siamangs (Experiment 4)."
Transfer and Acclimatization Effects on the Behavior of Two Species of African Great Ape (Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla) Moved to a Novel and Naturalistic Zoo Environment,"['Ross, SR', 'Wagner, KE', 'Schapiro, SJ', 'Hau, J', 'Lukas, KE']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-010-9441-3,FEB 2011,5,"Studying the effects of moving animals to new enclosures is of value to both captive managers and to scientists interested in the complex interplay between environment and behavior. Great apes represent some of the greatest challenges in this regard. Given the cognitive sophistication of these species and the substantial investments in new primate facilities, these investigations are particularly important. Using post-occupancy evaluation (POE) methodology, we compared behavior exhibited by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in indoor hardscape-type exhibits to behavior of the same individuals in new naturalistic enclosures with outdoor access. In the new facility, chimpanzees showed decreases in the frequency of abnormal behaviors and visual monitoring of humans (attention behaviors) whereas gorillas exhibited reduced agonism as well as decreased attention behaviors. Both gorillas and chimpanzees demonstrated higher rates of inactivity after transfer to the new facility. All subjects in addition demonstrated transitory changes in behavior after the move to the new facility (higher rates of scratching in yr 1 than in subsequent years), indicating a period of acclimatization. Seasonal effects on feeding behavior and activity levels (both species were more active in the winter) were evident as well. The results indicate that behavioral adjustment to a new facility is an extended process for both species and that seasonal effects should be considered in longitudinal analyses of acclimatization. Behavioral patterns supported the benefits of naturalistic, functional exhibit spaces and the utility of post-occupancy evaluations in assessing captive animal welfare."
Effect of Resting Patterns of Tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis and Saguinus mystax) on the Spatial Distribution of Seeds and Seedling Recruitment,"['Lazo, FJJM', 'Culot, L', 'Huynen, MC', 'Heymann, EW']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-010-9463-x,FEB 2011,4,"The spatial distributions of dispersed seeds have important evolutionary consequences for plants. Repeated defecations in sites frequently used by seed dispersers can result in high seed concentrations. We observed the resting behavior of a mixed-species group of tamarins in Peru and recorded the occurrence of seed dispersal (over 8 mo) and seed fate (over 11-22 mo) to determine whether the location and use of resting sites influenced the spatial distribution of dispersed seeds and seedlings. The tamarins rested mostly on trees (Saguinus fuscicollis: 60.6%, S. mystax: 89.2%) and dead trunks (S. fuscicollis: 24.4%) and used 61% of their resting sites repeatedly. During both the dry and wet seasons, tamarins dispersed significantly more seeds within resting areas (0.00662 and 0.00424 seeds/m(2), respectively) than outside them (0.00141 and 0.00181 seeds/m(2)). Seed survival and seedling recruitment did not differ significantly between resting and other areas, resulting in a higher seedling concentration around the resting sites. Seed density did not increase with the duration or the frequency of use of the resting sites but did increase when we pooled the seasonal resting sites together in 50 m x 50 m quadrats, ultimately causing a clumped distribution of dispersed seeds. The use of resting sites in secondary forest, particularly during the dry season, allows the creation of seedling recruitment centers for species coming from the primary forest. Our findings show that tamarin resting behavior affects the spatial distribution of dispersed seeds and seedlings, and their resting sites play an important role in plant diversity maintenance and facilitate forest regeneration in degraded areas."
"Confirmed Infection with Intestinal Schistosomiasis in Semi-Captive Wild-Born Chimpanzees on Ngamba Island, Uganda","['Standley, CJ', 'Mugisha, L', 'Verweij, JJ', 'Adriko, M', 'Arinaitwe, M', 'Rowell, C', 'Atuhaire, A', 'Betson, M', 'Hobbs, E', 'van Tulleken, CR', 'Kane, RA', 'van Lieshout, L', 'Ajarova, L', 'Kabatereine, NB', 'Stothard, JR']",VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES,10.1089/vbz.2010.0156,FEB 2011,7,"Background: Intestinal schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma mansoni, is endemic to Lake Victoria, with high prevalence of the disease observed in human lakeshore communities. However, nonhuman primates have recently been overlooked as potential hosts of the disease, despite known susceptibility.

Methods: Using a variety of stool, urine, and serological diagnostic methods, 39 semi-captive wild-born chimpanzees and 37 staff members at Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary, Lake Victoria, Uganda, were examined for S. mansoni infection. Miracidia recovered from stool were DNA barcoded to investigate cross-over between humans and chimpanzees. The island was also surveyed for Biomphalaria intermediate host snails, which were examined for infection with S. mansoni.

Results: Chimpanzees were unequivocally shown to be infected with intestinal schistosomiasis with a seroprevalence in excess of 90%. Three egg-positive cases were detected, although the sensitivity of the diagnostic tests varied due to earlier prophylactic praziquantel treatment. Miracidia hatched from chimpanzee stool revealed three DNA haplotypes commonly found in humans living throughout Lake Victoria, including staff on Ngamba Island, as well as two novel haplotypes. At one site, a snail was observed shedding schistosome cercariae.

Conclusions: The anthropozoonotic potential of intestinal schistosomiasis on Ngamba Island is greater than previously thought. Moreover, the ability of chimpanzees to void schistosome eggs capable of hatching into viable miracidia further suggests that these nonhuman primates may be capable of maintaining a local zoonotic transmission of schistosomiasis independently of humans. The implications for management of captive and wild primate populations at risk of exposure are discussed."
Evolution of subterminal satellite (StSat) repeats in hominids,"['Koga, A', 'Notohara, M', 'Hirai, H']",GENETICA,10.1007/s10709-010-9534-0,FEB 2011,8,"Subterminal satellite (StSat) repeats, consisting of 32-bp-long AT-rich units (GATATTTCCATGTT(T/C)ATACAGATAGCGGTGTA), were first found in chimpanzee and gorilla (African great apes) as one of the major components of heterochromatic regions located proximal to telomeres of chromosomes. StSat repeats have not been found in orangutan (Asian great ape) or human. This patchy distribution among species suggested that the StSat repeats were present in the common ancestor of African great apes and subsequently lost in the lineage leading to human. An alternative explanation is that the StSat repeats in chimpanzee and gorilla have different origins and the repeats did not occur in human. The purpose of the present study was quantitative evaluation of the above alternative possibilities by analyzing the nucleotide variation contained in the repeats. We collected large numbers of sequences of repeat units from genome sequence databases of chimpanzee and gorilla, and also bonobo (an African great ape phylogenetically closer to chimpanzee). We then compared the base composition of the repeat units among the 3 species, and found statistically significant similarities in the base composition. These results support the view that the StSat repeats had already formed multiple arrays in the common ancestor of African great apes. It is thus suggested that humans lost StSat repeats which had once grown to multiple arrays."

The complete buffalo hepcidin sequence is of 324 bp and have an ORF of 249 nucleotides from 14 to 262. The sequence analysis at nucleotide level showed homology of 98.0% with cattle, 84.3% with pig, whereas with human, chimpanzee and gorilla 80.3%, 80.7% and 81.5% respectively. The percent identity of buffalo hepcidin cDNA to that of japanese macaque, dog, gibbon, mouse and norway rat are81.9%, 79.9%, 79.9%, 67.9% and 65.9% respectively.

Space Use Selectivity by Chimpanzees and Gorillas in an Indoor-Outdoor Enclosure,"['Ross, SR', 'Calcutt, S', 'Schapiro, SJ', 'Hau, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20891,FEB 2011,10,"Understanding the relationship between physical environments and nonhuman primate behavior is a key element for effective care and management in a range of settings. The physical features of the captive environment, including not only gross useable space but also environmental complexity, can have a significant influence on primate behavior and ultimately, animal welfare. But despite this connection, there remains relatively little conclusive data on how captive primates, especially great apes, use the spaces provided to them, especially in modern, indoor-outdoor enclosures that have become more prevalent in recent years. In this study, we used four years of detailed data on where 23 great apes (chimpanzees and gorillas) positioned themselves within a modern, indoor-outdoor zoo enclosure to determine not only how the apes utilized their space but also how access to outdoor areas affected their spatial selectivity. We found that both species used relatively little of their available space: chimpanzees and gorillas spent half their time in only 3.2 and 1.5% of their useable three-dimensional space, respectively. Chimpanzees utilized the outdoor space more than gorillas, but access to the outdoors did not affect space selectivity in the indoor area for either species. Although both species of ape were highly selective in their space use, consideration should be given to the importance of providing the choice to locate in a variety of spaces, including outdoor areas. These data represent an extremely detailed account of space selectivity by great apes in an indoor-outdoor environment and have substantial implications for future facility design and captive primate management.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma as a paradigm of cancer genetics.,"['Simons, Malcolm J']",Chinese journal of cancer,NA,2011-Feb,11,"The unusual incidence patterns for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in China, Northeast India, Arctic Inuit, Peninsular and island Southeast Asia, Polynesian Islanders, and North Africans indicate a role for NPC risk genes in Chinese, Chinese-related, and not-obviously Chinese-related populations. Renewed interest in NPC genetic risk has been stimulated by a hypothesis that NPC population patterns originated in Bai-Yue / pre-Austronesian-speaking aborigines and were dispersed during the last glacial maximum by Sundaland submersion. Five articles in this issue of the Chinese Journal of Cancer, first presented at a meeting on genetic aspects of NPC [National Cancer Center of Singapore (NCCS), February 20-21, 2010], are directed towards incidence patterns, to early detection of affected individuals within risk populations, and to the application of genetic technology advances to understanding the nature of high risk. Turnbull presents a general framework for understanding population migrations that underlie NPC and similar complex diseases, including other viral cancers. Trejaut et al. apply genetic markers to detail migration from East Asia through Taiwan to the populating of Island Polynesia. Migration dispersal in a westward direction took mongoloid peoples to modern day Northeast India adjacent to Western China (Xinjiang). NPC incidence in mongoloid Nagas ranks amongst the highest in the world, whereas elsewhere in India NPC is uncommon. Cao et al. detail incidence patterns in Southeast China that have occurred over recent decades. Finally, Ji et al. describe the utility of Epstein-Barr virus serostatus in early NPC detection. While genetic risk factors still remain largely unknown, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been a focus of attention since the discovery of an HLA association with NPC in 1973 and, two years later, that NPC susceptibility in highest-risk Cantonese involved the co-occurrence of multi-HLA locus combinations of HLA genes as chromosome combinations, or haplotypes (e.g. HLA-A2-B46), whereas in relatively lower-risk non-Cantonese Chinese (Hokkiens, Teochews) they appeared to act independently, a strength of association reflecting the 30-50-fold difference in incidence between highest risk Cantonese and lowest-risk Indians. The prototypic haplotype HLA-A2-B46 extends over megabases. An upstream DNA segment (near HLA-DPA1), has close similarity to Gorilla, with no obvious homology to Chimpanzee in current databases, suggesting that a reticulate model of primate evolution may be more appropriate than simple phylogeny. The DNA variation level in this segment is high enough for it to be a hominin remnant. HLA-B46 arose in mongoloids and remains largely limited to Chinese so the question arises as to whether the hominin candidate segment indicates an eastward trek of Homo neanderthalensis or the survival of much earlier Homo erectus? In 2011 sequencing technologies have finally caught up with the requirement to separate parental haplotypes. Recently achieved chromosome separation for whole genome di-haploid genetic and epigenetic analysis of parental inheritance in single individuals will reveal interacting patterns of multi-locus haplotypes as humans move in and through successive environments, thus providing definitive information on the genetic affinities between extant populations, and of the migrations that have led to the global distribution of modern Homo. The challenge can now be met of seeking HLA-associated locations both within and outside the HLA complex on each of the pair of chromosomes. More broadly, for every disease, genetic risk detection will require resolution of the diploid genome as a di-haplome. In the context of NPC, HLA genetic risk complete autosomal di-haplomic sequencing will enable testing of the Wee unitary origin hypothesis of NPC risk even among populations with no apparent mongoloid affinity."
Ecological divergence and medial cuneiform morphology in gorillas,"['Tocheri, MW', 'Solhan, CR', 'Orr, CM', 'Femiani, J', 'Frohlich, B', 'Groves, CP', 'Harcourt-Smith, WE', 'Richmond, BG', 'Shoelson, B', 'Jungers, WL']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.09.002,FEB 2011,21,"Gorillas are more closely related to each other than to any other extant primate and are all terrestrial knuckle-walkers, but taxa differ along a gradient of dietary strategies and the frequency of arboreality in their behavioral repertoire. In this study, we test the hypothesis that medial cuneiform morphology falls on a morphocline in gorillas that tracks function related to hallucial abduction ability and relative frequency of arboreality. This morphocline predicts that western gorillas, being the most arboreal, should display a medial cuneiform anatomy that reflects the greatest hallucial abduction ability, followed by grauer gorillas, and then by mountain gorillas. Using a three-dimensional methodology to measure angles between articular surfaces, relative articular and nonarticular areas, and the curvatures of the hallucial articular surface, the functional predictions are partially confirmed in separating western gorillas from both eastern gorillas. Western gorillas are characterized by a more medially oriented, proportionately larger, and more mediolaterally curved hallucial facet than are eastern gorillas. These characteristics follow the predictions for a more prehensile hallux in western gorillas relative to a more stable, plantigrade hallux in eastern gorillas. The characteristics that distinguish eastern gorilla taxa from one another appear unrelated to hallucial abduction ability or frequency of arboreality. In total, this reexamination of medial cuneiform morphology suggests differentiation between eastern and western gorillas due to a longstanding ecological divergence and more recent and possibly non-adaptive differences between eastern taxa.

How Artificial Communication Affects the Communication and Cognition of the Great Apes,"['Call, J']",MIND & LANGUAGE,10.1111/j.1468-0017.2010.01408.x,FEB 2011,3,"Ape species-specific communication is grounded on the present, possesses some referential qualities and is mostly used to request objects or actions from others. Artificial systems of communication borrowed from humans transform apes' communicative exchanges by freeing them from the present (i.e. displaced reference) although requests still predominate as the main reason for communicating with others. Symbol use appears to enhance apes' relational abilities and their inhibitory control. Despite these substantial changes, it is concluded that even though artificial communication enhances thought and enables its expression more openly, it does not create it or modify the motivation behind communicative exchanges."

Although equally distantly related to humans, the ancestors of vervets diverged from those of macaques and baboons more than 11 million years ago, antedating the divergence of the ancestors of humans, chimpanzees and gorillas. To facilitate anatomic localization in the vervet brain, two linked on-line electronic atlases are described, one based on registered MRI scans from hundreds of vervets (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/Research/Atlases/Data/vervet/vervetmratlas/vervetmratlas.html) and the other based on a high-resolution cryomacrotome study of a single vervet (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/Research/Atlases/Data/vervet/vervetatlas/vervetatlas.html). The averaged MRI atlas is also available as a volume in Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative format. In the cryomacrotome atlas, various sulcal and subcortical structures have been anatomically labeled and surface rendered views are provided along the primary planes of section. Both atlases simultaneously provide views in all three primary planes of section, rapid navigation by clicking on the displayed images, and stereotaxic coordinates in the averaged MRI atlas space. Despite the extended time period since their divergence, the major sulcal and subcortical landmarks in vervets are highly conserved relative to those described in macaques. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Seven nematode species, one trematode, one cestode and three protozoa were detected. Eight different parasite species were found in Cercopithecus nictitans and six in C. neglectus, C pogonias and Cercocebus agilis. Helminths were found in 77% of monkeys, and protozoa in 36%. Trichuris sp. and Entamoeba coli were the most frequent parasites, being found in 54% and 36% of animals, respectively. Helminths were more frequent in adults than in juveniles, while the prevalence of protozoa was not age-related. No significant gender difference was found. Bushmeat monkeys had a significantly higher prevalence of helminth infection than pets (92% versus 51%), whereas there was no significant difference in the prevalence of protozoa (32% versus 43%). Among helminth species, Strongyloides fulleborni was more prevalent in bushmeat monkeys than in pets (55% versus 15%), as were Ancylostoma spp. (62% versus 9%). As these parasites are transmitted transcutaneously by infectious larva, they have a high potential for transmission to humans, during butchering. One pet monkey kept in an urban household in Yaounde was infected by Schistosoma mansoni. The potential public health implications of these findings are discussed.

Since the availability of leaves is much higher than that of fruits, we expected that the primarily folivorous langurs would use a larger number of resources than the primarily frugivorous macaques. Since fruits are a relatively total resource, unlike leaves, of which only selected parts are consumed, we expected that the primarily frugivorous macaques would use resources more proportionately than the folivorous langurs, resulting in a wider food niche breadth in macaques. We collected data on these primate species over a period of 2 years using scan sampling in a contiguous rain forest. We calculated Levin's standardised food niche breadth for each species. Langurs used a larger number of tree species than macaques, but their niche breadth was narrower than that of macaques. The majority of their diet (over 50%) came from only a few trees in the case of all three primate species.

We determined the genotypes of 52 individuals across 9 microsatellite loci. We found genetic divergence between the populations, each exhibiting low genetic diversity. Analysis revealed broad- and fine-scale population structuring. Both populations have evidently experienced population reduction and a genetic bottleneck without presenting any apparent detrimental effect. Anyway, measures should be taken to effectively protect the forests where L. caissara occurs in order to allow its populations to increase and counteract the eventual effects of genetic impoverishment.

Quantitative and qualitative surveys on the consumption of bushmeat were undertaken in Brazzaville in 2006, in about 1,050 urban households. The main objective was to establish the profiles of consumers and of species concerned. The results showed that 88.3% of the surveyed households consumed bushmeat. Their average size was 5.7 +/- 3.2 persons. The average monthly income of an urban consumer with a permanent job was 98,334 (US$ 197) +/- 84,306 (US$ 169) FCFA. It appeared that households preferred to consume bushmeat for two major reasons: the taste or flavor (67.8%) and food habits (14.7%). Meat from mammals was preferred, the top three orders of this class being artiodactyls (48.3%), rodents (28.3%), and primates (13.0%). Some of them are listed as threatened in Congo Brazzaville and are included in the IUCN Red List.

A survey on bushmeat trade was undertaken in 21 municipal markets during four weeks, in Brazzaville. The objective of this study was to define the traders' profile and to evaluate the quantities of games and meat merchandised on the municipal markets. The study methodology combined two approaches: a quantitative one using a questionnaire as principal tool for collecting data, and a qualitative one associating informal survey methods via individual or group interviews. The results showed that women were the most involved in this trade (52%). Markets trader's monthly income was estimated at 210,428 (US$420) +/- 49,128 (US$ 98,256) FCFA.

It was also noticed that trapping, an activity which leads to great losses, becomes very important, followed by be helpful alternatives to meet Congolese demand for bushmeat. For a sustainable management of the Congo's faunic resources, this study suggests the introduction gun-hunting. The Congo-Ocean Railway and the National Road n degrees 2 were used regularly in the transportation of game, to a 72% level. The district of Niari, Lekoumou, Sangha and Pool were the main sources of supply. At the present time, the meat quantities offered in Brazzaville markets don't seem to be reduced because hunting areas extend always further, often to the detriment of protected areas.

A survey was conducted in 2007 in five villages to assess local perceptions of human-gorilla totemic kinship practices and taboos against hunting and against eating of gorillas. Villages were selected based on their proximity to Cross River gorilla (CRG) habitat, with a total of 184 interviewer-administered questionnaires completed during a 4-week period. Eighty-six percent of people agreed that gorillas were totems (personal spiritual helpers or counterparts) of people living in the village. People who believed in human-gorilla totemic kinship practice did not eat or hunt gorillas, and they wanted gorillas to be protected in order to protect the practice. Most (87%), of the interviewees declared their support for gorilla conservation. The main motivation was the belief that when gorillas are killed, the human totemic counterpart will die as a result. Because of these traditions, the hunting of gorillas is taboo in all five villages surveyed. On the other hand, gorilla parts play a direct role in traditional medicine, and gorilla bones are valued as ingredients for traditional medicine. Also, general awareness and adherence to local totemic practices was found to be declining, particularly among young people (18-25 years). Despite the imminent decline in value of belief systems that led to the establishment of the hunting taboo, this taboo is still in place and has discouraged the hunting of gorillas. Where law enforcement is weak or near inexistent, these traditional restrictions could be critical to the continuing survival of a gorilla population. Reviving and promoting beliefs and practices conducive to gorilla conservation could foster positive attitudes and behavior and have the potential to encourage local support and participation in communities. However, care must be taken when selecting practices to promote, as some (for example the use of gorillas in traditional medicine) could encourage the killing of animals."

The principal lesson that emerges from interviews with IGCP partner organizations relates to the benefits of a oconservation logico in which conservation and development outcomes are linked through mutual dependence but also contractual conditionality."

Analyses examined attention to threat above and beyond and in interaction with both proximity to the mask and fear of novelty observed in other situations. Attention to threat interacted with proximity to the mask to predict social inhibition, such that attention to threat most strongly predicted social inhibition when toddlers stayed furthest from the mask. This relation occurred above and beyond the predictive relation between fear of novelty and social inhibition.

Brief Communication: Testing the Usefulness of the Basilar Suture as a Means to Determine Age in Great Ape Skeletons,"['Poe, DJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21406,JAN 2011,2,"A fused/closed basilar suture is usually treated as an indication of old age in great apes. A sample, drawn from a variety of sources, of known-aged captive great ape skeletons was analyzed to test the usefulness of using the basilar suture to categorize adult skeletons as either ""adult'' or ""old adult''. The state of closure of the basilar suture was examined in 30 chimpanzees, 19 gorillas, and 15 orangutans, all of known age. The results show that the basilar suture demonstrates a high level of uniformity in rate of closure and is closed at an early age in virtually all known-aged individuals. Thus, an old adult category most likely includes individuals who are, in fact, relatively young. This indicates that using the basilar suture as a means to classify individual skeletons as adult or old adult is very imprecise. The homogenous nature of basilar suture closure appears to prevent meaningful application of suture status for categorizing adult ape skeletons by age groups. Am J Phys Anthropol 144:162-165, 2011.

Black and Gold Howler Monkeys (Alouatta caraya) as Sentinels of Ecosystem Health: Patterns of Zoonotic Protozoa Infection Relative to Degree of Human-Primate Contact,"['Kowalewski, MM', 'Salzer, JS', 'Deutsch, JC', 'Rano, M', 'Kuhlenschmidt, MS', 'Gillespie, TR']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20803,JAN 2011,15,"Exponential expansion of human populations and human activities within primate habitats has resulted in high potential for pathogen exchange creating challenges for biodiversity conservation and global health. Under such conditions, resilient habitat generalists such as black and gold howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya) may act as effective sentinels to overall ecosystem health and alert us to impending epidemics in the human population. To better understand this potential, we examined noninvasively collected fecal samples from black and gold howler monkeys from remote, rural, and village populations in Northern Argentina. We examined all samples (n = 90) for the zoonotic protozoa Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia sp. via immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) detection. All samples were negative for Cryptosporidium sp. The prevalence of Giardia sp. was significantly higher at the rural site (67%) compared with the remote forest (57%) and village (40%) sites. A lack of Cryptosporidium sp. in all samples examined suggests that this pathogen is not a natural component of the howler parasite communities at these sites and that current land-use patterns and livestock contact are not exposing Argentine howler monkeys to this pathogen. High prevalence of Giardia sp. at all sites suggests that howler monkeys may serve as a viable reservoir for Giardia. Significantly higher prevalence of Giardia sp. at the rural site, where primate-livestock contact is highest, suggests the presence of multiple Giardia clades or increased exposure to Giardia through repeated zoonotic transmission among nonhuman primates, livestock, and/or people. These results highlight the need for future research into the epidemiology, cross-species transmission ecology, and clinical consequences of Giardia and other infectious agents not only in humans and livestock, but also in the wild animals that share their environments.

The use of heterospecific cues has been largely investigated using primates, dogs, and other mammals; less is known about whether birds can also use heterospecific gestures. We tested six Clark's nutcrackers in a two-way object-choice task using touch, point, and gaze cues to investigate whether these birds can use human gestures to find food. Most of the birds were able to use a touch gesture during the first trial of testing and were able to learn to use point and gaze (eyes and head alternation) cues after a limited number of trials. This study is the first to test a non-social corvid on the object-choice task. The performance of non-social nutcrackers is similar to that of more social and related corvids, suggesting that species with different evolutionary histories can utilize gestural information."

Biomedical Differences Between Human and Nonhuman Hominids: Potential Roles for Uniquely Human Aspects of Sialic Acid Biology,"['Varki, NM', 'Strobert, E', 'Dick, EJ', 'Benirschke, K', 'Varki, A']","ANNUAL REVIEW OF PATHOLOGY: MECHANISMS OF DISEASE, VOL 6",10.1146/annurev-pathol-011110-130315,2011,41,"Although humans are genetically very similar to the evolutionarily related nonhuman hominids (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans), comparative studies suggest a surprising number of uniquely human differences in the incidence and/or severity of biomedical conditions. Some differences are due to anatomical changes that occurred during human evolution. However, many cannot be explained either by these changes or by known environmental factors. Because chimpanzees were long considered models for human disease, it is important to be aware of these differences, which appear to have been deemphasized relative to similarities. We focus on the pathophysiology and pathobiology of biomedical conditions that appear unique to humans, including several speculative possibilities that require further study. We pay particular attention to the possible contributions of uniquely human changes in the biology of cell-surface sialic acids and the proteins that recognize them. We also discuss the metabolic incorporation of a diet-derived nonhuman sialic acid, which generates a novel xeno-autoantigen reaction, and chronic inflammation known as xenosialitis."
"Dispersal in male ursine colobus monkeys (Colobus vellerosus): influence of age, rank and contact with other groups on dispersal decisions","['Teichroeb, JA', 'Wikberg, EC', 'Sicotte, P']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/000579511X577157,2011,12,"Dispersal is male-biased in ursine colobus monkeys (Colobus vellerosus), although female dispersal also occurs (Teichroeb et al., 2009). Here we describe the process of male dispersal and its connection with between-group encounters (BGEs, N = 444) and male incursions (when males left their group and approached within 50 m of another group: N = 128) at the Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary in central Ghana. Through BGEs and incursions, particularly those with non-aggressive interactions between individuals in different groups (BGEs, N = 17; incursions, N = 4), males could probably assess other groups for dispersal opportunities. There was a trend for males to perform incursions more frequently before emigrating voluntarily than involuntarily. Incursions were often performed towards the group that the male eventually transferred to. Incursions by alpha males were temporally shorter and more aggressive than those by non-alpha males. We suggest that non-alpha males used incursions to assess other groups for breeding or dispersal opportunities, whereas alpha males performed incursions mainly to convey information about their quality to neighbouring males and females. Male emigrations/disappearances (natal N = 20, secondary N = 43, unknown N = 9) and immigrations (N = 62) were recorded for seven groups during ten years (2000 2010). Alpha males always emigrated involuntarily. Parallel emigration and immigration occurred. Males often immigrated into groups with a more favourable adult male/adult female ratio and improved their rank, both of which likely increased their mating opportunities. The most fitting ultimate explanation for both natal and. secondary male dispersal in this population was the intrasexual competition for mates hypothesis, as males of all ages appeared to emigrate to improve their reproductive opportunities."
Testing brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus) on the reverse-reward contingency task without a modified procedure,"['Genty, E', 'Chung, PCS', 'Roeder, JJ']",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,10.1016/j.beproc.2010.10.006,JAN 2011,6,"A common paradigm used to study inhibitory control is the reverse-reward contingency task in which the subject is presented with a choice between two different quantities of food and is rewarded with the non-chosen item. Most animals have problems inhibiting their impulsive choice towards the larger quantity, and need correction procedures to master the reverse-reward task. Recent studies have nonetheless shown that rhesus macaques and white crowned mangabeys were able to master the task without correction procedures after a large number of trials were applied.

We previously demonstrated that, similar to other primates tested under the reverse-reward contingency task, lemurs initially showed an impulsive bias towards the larger quantity of food. But following introduction of a large-or-none contingency, all the subjects learned to reliably select the smaller quantity in order to gain access to the larger one. Here, we assessed the possibility that, similar to rhesus macaques and mangabeys, lemurs could master the reverse-reward task, without a modified procedure, by presenting a large number of trials. One of 5 subjects was able to master the task and then generalize performance to novel food arrays. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Gorilla and Orangutan Brains Conform to the Primate Cellular Scaling Rules: Implications for Human Evolution","['Herculano-Houzel, S', 'Kaas, JH']",BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION,10.1159/000322729,2011,20,"Gorillas and orangutans are primates at least as large as humans, but their brains amount to about one third of the size of the human brain. This discrepancy has been used as evidence that the human brain is about 3 times larger than it should be for a primate species of its body size. In contrast to the view that the human brain is special in its size, we have suggested that it is the great apes that might have evolved bodies that are unusually large, on the basis of our recent finding that the cellular composition of the human brain matches that expected for a primate brain of its size, making the human brain a linearly scaled-up primate brain in its number of cells. To investigate whether the brain of great apes also conforms to the primate cellular scaling rules identified previously, we determine the numbers of neuronal and other cells that compose the orangutan and gorilla cerebella, use these numbers to calculate the size of the brain and of the cerebral cortex expected for these species, and show that these match the sizes described in the literature. Our results suggest that the brains of great apes also scale linearly in their numbers of neurons like other primate brains, including humans. The conformity of great apes and humans to the linear cellular scaling rules that apply to other primates that diverged earlier in primate evolution indicates that prehistoric Homo species as well as other hominins must have had brains that conformed to the same scaling rules, irrespective of their body size. We then used those scaling rules and published estimated brain volumes for various hominin species to predict the numbers of neurons that composed their brains. We predict that Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis had brains with approximately 80 billion neurons, within the range of variation found in modern Homo sapiens. We propose that while the cellular scaling rules that apply to the primate brain have remained stable in hominin evolution (since they apply to simians, great apes and modern humans alike), the Colobinae and Pongidae lineages favored marked increases in body size rather than brain size from the common ancestor with the Homo lineage, while the Homo lineage seems to have favored a large brain instead of a large body, possibly due to the metabolic limitations to having both.

Land use in semi-free ranging Tonkean macaques Macaca tonkeana depends on environmental conditions: A geographical information system approach,"['Sueur, C', 'Salze, P', 'Weber, C', 'Petit, O']",CURRENT ZOOLOGY,NA,2011,3,"Wild animals use their habitat according to ecological pressures such as predation, resource availability or temperature, yet little is known about how individuals use their environment in semi free-ranging conditions. We assessed whether a semi-free ranging group of Tonkean macaques Macaca tonkeana used its wooded parkland in a heterogeneous way. GIS and GPS were used to determine whether individuals adjusted their behaviors according to variation in environmental constraints over time of day and the course of a year. We demonstrated that social and resting activities occurred in high altitude areas and areas with a high density of bushes, whereas the group foraged in areas where the density of bushes and grass was low. In general, the animals used areas exposed to the sun that were not on a slope. Semi-free ranging Tonkean macaques seemed to behave like their wild counterparts in terms of activity budget, land use per activity and thermoregulation [Current Zoology 57 (1): 8-17, 2011]."

The power of social structure: how we became an intelligent lineage,"['Antonio, MRD', 'Schulze-Makuch, D']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY,10.1017/S1473550410000169,JAN 2011,1,"New findings pertinent to the human lineage origin (Ardipithecus ramidus) prompt a new analysis of the extrapolation of the social behavior of our closest relatives, the great apes, into human 'natural social behavior'. With the new findings it becomes clear that human ancestors had very divergent social arrangements from the ones we observe today in our closest genetic relatives.

The social structure of chimpanzees and gorillas is characterized by male competition. Aggression and the instigation of fear are common place. The morphology of A. ramidus points in the direction of a social system characterized by female-choice instead of male-male competition. This system tends to be characterized by reduced aggression levels, leading to more stable arrangements. It is postulated here that the social stability with accompanying group cohesion propitiated by this setting is favorable to the investment in more complex behaviors, the development of innovative approaches to solve familiar problems, an increase in exploratory behavior, and eventually higher intelligence and the use of sophisticated tools and technology.

The concentration of research efforts into the study of social animals with similar social systems (e.g., New World social monkeys (Callitrichidae), social canids (Canidae) and social rodents (Rodentia)) are likely to provide new insights into the understanding of what factors determined our evolution into an intelligent species capable of advanced technology.

In vivo bone strain and finite-element modeling of the craniofacial haft in catarrhine primates,"['Ross, CF', 'Berthaume, MA', 'Dechow, PC', 'Iriarte-Diaz, J', 'Porro, LB', 'Richmond, BG', 'Spencer, M', 'Strait, D']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2010.01322.x,JAN 2011,37,"Hypotheses regarding patterns of stress, strain and deformation in the craniofacial skeleton are central to adaptive explanations for the evolution of primate craniofacial form. The complexity of craniofacial skeletal morphology makes it difficult to evaluate these hypotheses with in vivo bone strain data. In this paper, new in vivo bone strain data from the intraorbital surfaces of the supraorbital torus, postorbital bar and postorbital septum, the anterior surface of the postorbital bar, and the anterior root of the zygoma are combined with published data from the supraorbital region and zygomatic arch to evaluate the validity of a finite-element model (FEM) of a macaque cranium during mastication. The behavior of this model is then used to test hypotheses regarding the overall deformation regime in the craniofacial haft of macaques. This FEM constitutes a hypothesis regarding deformation of the facial skeleton during mastication. A simplified verbal description of the deformation regime in the macaque FEM is as follows. Inferior bending and twisting of the zygomatic arches about a rostrocaudal axis exerts inferolaterally directed tensile forces on the lateral orbital wall, bending the wall and the supraorbital torus in frontal planes and bending and shearing the infraorbital region and anterior zygoma root in frontal planes. Similar deformation regimes also characterize the crania of Homo and Gorilla under in vitro loading conditions and may be shared among extant catarrhines. Relatively high strain magnitudes in the anterior root of the zygoma suggest that the morphology of this region may be important for resisting forces generated during feeding."
Behavioral Responses of Silverback Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) to Videos,"['Maloney, MA', 'Leighty, KA', 'Kuhar, CW', 'Bettinger, TL']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,10.1080/10888705.2011.551621,2011,1,"This study examined the impact of video presentations on the behavior of 4 silverback, western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). On each of 5 occasions, gorillas viewed 6 types of videos (blue screen, humans, an all-male or mixed-sex group engaged in low activity, and an all-male or mixed-sex group engaged in agonistic behavior). The study recorded behavioral responses and watching rates. All gorillas preferred dynamic over static videos; 3 watched videos depicting gorillas significantly more than those depicting humans. Among the gorilla videos, the gorillas clearly preferred watching the mixed-sex group engaged in agonistic behavior; yet, this did not lead to an increase in aggression or behavior indicating agitation. Further, habituation to videos depicting gorillas did not occur. This supports the effectiveness of this form of enrichment, particularly for a nonhuman animal needing to be separated temporarily due to illness, shipment quarantine, social restructuring, or exhibit modification."

The aim of the article is twofold: first to position biodiversity conservation and ecotourism within broader approaches to development; and second to achieve a critical understanding of the processes and practices that seek to produce eco-friendly subjectivities and ecotourism entrepreneurs. The article focuses on a biodiversity conservation and development project in south-western Uganda: the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), which is home to almost half the world population of the endangered mountain gorilla. This article outlines the social, cultural and economic gains and losses in BINP, employing discourse analysis to map out narratives through which biodiversity conservation and ecotourism have been mainstreamed into international sustainable development. The case study illustrates how these discourses of biodiversity conservation, ecotourism and sustainable development are being transformed and negotiated in practice with development agencies, such as the World Bank, USAID and CARE, and local residents."
Creation of a panel of vectors based on ape adenovirus isolates,"['Roy, S', 'Medina-Jaszek, A', 'Wilson, MJ', 'Sandhu, A', 'Calcedo, R', 'Lin, JP', 'Wilson, JM']",JOURNAL OF GENE MEDICINE,10.1002/jgm.1530,JAN 2011,12,"Background We recently reported the isolation and sequencing of 30 novel adenoviruses from chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas. These adenoviruses are promising candidates for the purpose of expanding the repertoire of adenoviral serotypes that can be used to create vectors for circumventing pre-existing neutralizing antibodies in human populations. We thus aimed to create vectors from 20 of the newly isolated adenoviruses.

Methods Plasmid molecular clones were created that harbored the complete E1-deleted genomes from 20 of the newly isolated ape adenoviruses belonging to species B, C and E. The plasmids were transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells to rescue vectors. We also tested normal human sera to determine the extent of pre-existing cross-neutralizing anti-adenovirus neutralizing antibodies.

Results Twelve vectors could be rescued and expanded following transfection into HEK 293 cells with yields (from fifty 150-mm culture dishes) that ranged from 3 x 10(11) to 7 x 10(13) viral particles. Sera from 50 normal human donors were tested for the presence of neutralizing activity against 21 of the newly isolated ape adenoviruses. Cross-neutralizing activity was generally low, although outliers with high neutralizing activity were frequently detected. Species B ape adenoviruses generally showed the least cross-neutralization with antibodies present in the human sera that were tested.

Conclusions E1-deleted adenovirus vectors can be created from a wide variety of ape adenoviruses that can be rescued and propagated in HEK 293 cells. The prevalence of pre-existing antibodies that can neutralize these adenoviruses in human populations is low. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Patterns of differences in brain morphology in humans as compared to extant apes,"['Aldridge, K']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.09.007,JAN 2011,16,"Although human evolution is characterized by a vast increase in brain size, it is not clear whether or not certain regions of the brain are enlarged disproportionately in humans, or how this enlargement relates to differences in overall neural morphology. The aim of this study is to determine whether or not there are specific suites of features that distinguish the morphology of the human brain from that of apes. The study sample consists of whole brain, in vivo magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) and five ape species (gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos). Twenty-nine 3D landmarks, including surface and internal features of the brain were located on 3D MRI reconstructions of each individual using MEASURE software. Landmark coordinate data were scaled for differences in size and analyzed using Euclidean Distance Matrix Analysis (EDMA) to statistically compare the brains of each non-human ape species to the human sample. Results of analyses show both a pattern of brain morphology that is consistently different between all apes and humans, as well as patterns that differ among species. Further, both the consistent and species-specific patterns include cortical and subcortical features. The pattern that remains consistent across species indicates a morphological reorganization of 1) relationships between cortical and subcortical frontal structures. 2) expansion of the temporal lobe and location of the amygdala, and 3) expansion of the anterior parietal region. Additionally, results demonstrate that, although there is a pattern of morphology that uniquely defines the human brain, there are also patterns that uniquely differentiate human morphology from the morphology of each non-human ape species, indicating that reorganization of neural morphology occurred at the evolutionary divergence of each of these groups.

Postlesion Recovery of Motor and Sensory Cortex in the Early Twentieth Century,"['Wiesendanger, M']",JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF THE NEUROSCIENCES,10.1080/09647041003775446,2011,5,"This article addresses early work on partial recovery that followed small motor cortical lesions. Leyton and Sherrington (1917) studied the motor cortex in apes, hoping to learn more about the contralateral muscle representations. Then they placed small lesions within the precentral cortex, followed by a loss of the contralateral muscle twitches. The sudden loss remained for about one week, but recovery was observed and continued for weeks, up to a standstill. Sherrington and Graham Brown (1913) observed the same results in a serial, chronic experiment on a chimpanzee. The brain was sent to Monakow's Brain-Institute in Zurich for investigating the lesions and the degeneration pattern. Constantin von Monakow (1853-1930) had been a pioneer on recovery after acute lesions, coining the term odiaschisis.o During WWI, Graham Brown and Stewart (1916) studied a soldier in a British army hospital who suffered from a cerebral gunshot wound, localized in the sensorimotor cortex. Early and prolonged rehabilitation was successful. In 1950, Glees (1909-1999) and Cole (Oxford) placed a small motor-cortical lesion in macaque monkeys; for a few days, the monkeys had difficulties and were slow for the task. Daily training was resumed and recovery was accelerated by alimentary reward. Finally, Lashley (1890-1958) understood that handicapped patients oachieved their goal with variable means.o This demonstrated the value of active and prolonged rehabilitation, in addition to the (passive) recovery of function."
"The Difference in Morphological Hair Cuticle and the Elements and Minerals Content  According to Mammalia Hair Types  -Focused on the Representation Human, Orangutan, Gorilla, Chimpanzee-","['오강수', '류은주']",Journal of the Korean Society of Design Culture,NA,2011,0,"This study was designed to inquire into the difference between individuals through an analysis of epidermal shape and the extraction of elements and minerals, which mammals’ hair contains, according to hair types. Papers that examine human’s hair and wool under a microscope are reported, but there are no papers analyzing hair loss condition-pigmented hair, terminal hair, gray hair, poliosis, lanugo hair-made terminal hair, very thin hair, epidermis and minerals of chest hair among human’s hair. Papers that compare epidermis and minerals contents of orangutan’s, gorilla’s and chimpanzee’s hair are not also reported. At such time, the inquiry into the epidermis and minerals contents of hair between mammals can give a significant meaning in understanding hair’s characteristics. This study was designed to compare epidermis and minerals elements in the morphological part on orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees of mammals it is similar in genetic constitution to human. It made a comparative analysis of vellus hair and chest hair as male-pattern hair loss conditions of men in their 50s, pigment hair, terminal hair, gray hair and terminal hair being lanugo hair, terminal hair and poliosis hair as normal pigment hair of men in their 50s, terminal hair and poliosis hair as normal pigment hair of women in their 50s, orangutans’ terminal hair in the summer and winter, little female orangutans’ terminal hair, female orangutans’ chest hair in the winter, gorillas’ terminal hair and gray hair in the summer, gorillas’ terminal hair in the winter, male chimpanzees’ terminal hair and vellus hair surface in the winter. Besides, it made a comparative analysis of C, N, O, S, C1, Ca and K content of these mammalia hair. Samples of pigmented hair and gray hair were taken from men and women in their 50s. For samples, male hair is thin and some wavy hair with a type of hereditary baldness. Female hair is normal straight hair unrelated to hereditary baldness and virgin hair undamaged by chemical treatment or heat. It was directly pulled out within parietal region. The surface and cross section of hair shaft linked to the hair root region was cut within 1㎝ and in lengths of 0.3㎝, respectively. The samples of the great apes’ hair were directly collected from orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees breeding in the zoo for 4 times from January to September, 2008. Or samples fallen in the pen was also collected. For gorillas in low-lying areas born in 1968 and in January, 1969, male hair of silver back and female hair were respectively collected. For orangutans born in 1968, female hair, male hair of 13-year-old, female chest hair of 6-and 3-year-old were collected. Chimpanzees’ hair was collected in the pen which can’t distinguish between male and female sex. By selecting 2 types of downy hair and normal hair, the surface of hair root and hair shaft region was cut in lengths of 1 ㎝. And the cross section of hair root and hair shaft region was also cut in lengths of about 0.3㎝. Scanning election microscope(SEM, S4200, Japan, KBSI, Busan) and ion-Sputter(JFC-1100, Japan) were used for this study. Each samples were observed in 15kv acceleration voltage of scanning election microscope after Vaccum processing for 25 minutes by the handling method of cut surface in 30 minutes since liquid nitrogen charging without scouring and the preparation of adhesive sampling on the carbon tape in the stage, and the components of C, N, O, Ca, K and C1 embedded in hair or fur were inquired by the plating with gold or plathorium for 80 minutes to a thickness of 20㎜ using ion-sputter. For this, the analysis was made by 15㎸ acceleration voltage using energy distribution spectroscopic analyzer. This study showed that on the SEM, the tip variation and the serraction according to cuticle cell-lap between fur types vary just a little, but the morphological serrations have the identical shape. Unusually, male gray hair and poliosis hair did not show the serration shape, but female poliosis hair showed the clear serration, and primate hair, which is less of care from the outside environment, broke or showed the lifting for lack of moisture and sebum, which the epidermal state may vary depending on the hair management methods. C was similarly detected from the normal hair of men and women in their 50s, but markedly low for male-pattern hair loss conditions, gray hair(±10). N was found high by about ±14 in male-pattern hair loss conditions, gray hair, or low by ±3 for poliosis hair. The amount of S was no difference in normal hair and poliosis hair, but was detected markedly low in male-pattern hair loss conditions, gray hair. S plays a role in stabilizing the structure when a polypeptide as a main element, which forms a disulfide bond, are curly and folded. It could be inferred that the low amount of S does drop the security of hair when chemical treatment, and decrease the wave retention of hair. Judging from that C and N are not also stable compared to terminal hair and vellus hair, gray hair of hair loss conditions was not stable even in an atomic distribution. Ca was also detected only in male-pattern hair loss conditions, gray hair. The high amount of C between mammalia hair was detected in the winter, male than female, pigment hair than gray hair, and that of N was detected in lanugo hair or gray hair than pigment hair, showing the high deviation between each individuals. Judging from that the lowest amount of S was detected in gray hair like human hair, the atomic structure of gray hair like that of human hair was not stable. These findings indicated that as mammals are much alike in the chemical structure of hair, they are also similar in the epidermal state and minerals content, but the detection of C, N, S and Ca was unstable in male-pattern hair loss conditions, gray hair than in regular hair. Even if they are much alike in epidermal morphological characteristics of hair, the epidermal state might vary depending on the hair management methods from an angle of eocosystems than its original characteristics."
The Presence of a vpu Gene and the Lack of Nef-Mediated Downmodulation of T Cell Receptor-CD3 Are Not Always Linked in Primate Lentiviruses,"['Schmokel, J', 'Sauter, D', 'Schindler, M', 'Leendertz, FH', 'Bailes, E', 'Dazza, MC', 'Saragosti, S', 'Bibollet-Ruche, F', 'Peeters, M', 'Hahn, BH', 'Kirchhoff, F']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.02087-10,JAN 2011,12,"Nef is an accessory protein critical for the ability of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV) to replicate efficiently in their respective hosts. Previous analyses of members of 15 different primate lentivirus lineages revealed a link between Nef function and the presence of a vpu gene. In particular, Nef proteins of all vpu-containing viruses had lost their ability to downmodulate the T cell (TCR-CD3) receptor. Here we examined Nef proteins from eight additional SIV lineages, including SIVgor, SIVwrc, SIVolc, SIVgri, SIVdrl, SIVlho, SIVden, and SIVasc, from western lowland gorillas, western red colobus monkeys, olive colobus monkeys, grivet monkeys, drills, L'Hoest's monkeys, Dent's mona monkeys, and red-tailed monkeys, respectively. We found that except for the nef gene of SIVdrl, all of them were efficiently expressed and modulated CD4, major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), CD28, CXCR4, and Ii cell surface expression and/or enhanced viral infectivity and replication. Furthermore, the Nef proteins of SIVgri, SIVlho, SIVwrc, SIVolc, and SIVgor antagonized tetherin. As expected, the Nef protein of SIVgor, which carries vpu, failed to downmodulate CD3, whereas those of SIVwrc, SIVgri, SIVlho, and SIVasc, which lack vpu, were capable of performing this function. Surprisingly, however, the Nef protein of the vpu-containing SIVden strain retained the ability to downmodulate TCR-CD3, whereas that of SIVolc, which does not contain vpu, was unable to perform this function. Although the SIVden Vpu is about 20 amino acids shorter than other Vpu proteins, it degrades CD4 and antagonizes tetherin. Our data show that there are exceptions to the link between the presence of a vpu gene and nef alleles deficient in CD3 modulation, indicating that host properties also affect the selective pressure for Nef-mediated disruption of TCR-CD3 signaling. Our results are also further evidence that tetherin antagonism is a common function of primate lentivirus Nef proteins and that the resistance of human tetherin to Nef represents a relevant barrier to cross-species transmission of SIVs to humans."

We analyzed samples from 30 wild chimpanzees and one captive gorilla and identified two new groups of polyomaviruses (PyVs). These new viruses are by far the closest relatives to MCPyV described to date, providing the first evidence of the natural occurrence of PyVs related to MCPyV in wild great apes. Similar to MCPyV, the prevalence of these viruses is relatively high (>30%). This, together with the fact that humans in West and Central Africa frequently hunt and butcher primates, may point toward further MCPyV-like strains spreading to, or already existing in, our species."
Home range size in the blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur flavifrons): A comparison between dry and wet seasons,"['Volampeno, MSN', 'Masters, JC', 'Downs, CT', 'PROPITHECUS-VERREAUXI']",MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.mambio.2010.04.005,2011,7,"Western Madagascar is subjected to a long, dry winter season which coincides with food scarcity. We investigated the effect of this seasonal variation in food availability on the home ranges of blue-eyed black lemurs (Eulemur flavifrons) in the Sahamalaza-Iles Radama National Park, north-western Madagascar. It was expected that home range would increase and overlap more in the dry season. The study was conducted in an area of dry rainforest from September 2006 to March 2008 with five lemur groups. Animals were located by direct observation and geographical locations recorded to determine the daily path length and the home range sizes of the study groups in the respective seasons. Daily path length and home range size varied significantly between seasons. Daily path length was significantly greater in the dry season (673.4 +/- 539.2 m) than in the wet season (423.6 +/- 183.2 m). Home ranges overlapped between groups in both seasons, but were significantly larger during the dry season (MCP: 7.5 +/- 6.6 ha, 95% Kernel: 8.5 +/- 6.6 ha) than in the wet season (MCP: 3.0 +/- 1.6 ha, 95% Kernel: 4.1 +/- 1.6 ha). There was no clear relationship between home range size and group size in either the dry or the wet season. Seasonal changes in home range area are likely to be a consequence of reduced food availability in the dry season.

Three-dimensional orientations of talar articular surfaces in humans and great apes,"['Kanamoto, S', 'Ogihara, N', 'Nakatsukasa, M']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-010-0219-1,JAN 2011,5,"The morphology of the talus prescribes relative positions and movements of the calcaneus and navicular with respect to the tibia, hence determining the overall geometry, mobility and function of the foot that mechanically interacts with environments. Clarifying the variations of the articular surface orientations of the talus in humans and extant great apes is therefore of importance in understanding the evolution of bipedal locomotion in the human lineage. The aim of this study is to clarify the three-dimensional orientations of three articular surfaces of the talus (superior, posterior calcaneal and navicular articular surfaces) by means of the newly proposed surface approximation method. Thirty-two tali in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans were scanned using a three-dimensional noncontact digitizer, and the articular surfaces were then approximated using a paraboloid or a plane to calculate the orientations of the surfaces with respect to the body of the talus. The results quantitatively demonstrated that the superior articular surfaces in humans were relatively more parallel with the horizontal plane of the talar body, while those in apes were more medially oriented. Furthermore, the cylindrical axis defined by the shape of the posterior calcaneal articular surface was directed less anteroposteriorly in humans than in apes, in contrast to the fact that the subtalar axis is more anteroposteriorly oriented in humans. It was also demonstrated that the navicular articular surface in humans was more plantarly oriented and axially twisted. These specialized features of the human talus seem to be functionally linked to obligate bipedal locomotion. The talar morphological differences among the great apes were prominent in the mediolateral and rotational orientations of the navicular articular surfaces, possibly reflecting the degree of arboreality among the great apes."
A New Look at an Old Canal,"['Marom, A']",SKULL BASE-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH,10.1055/s-0030-1263282,JAN 2011,2,"Attempts to explain abducens vulnerability have centered around the petroclival segment of its pathway in the skull base, in particular, its relations to the Dorello's canal and the petrosphenoidal ligament of Gruber. This study aims to contribute to the definition of the Dorello's canal and to the understanding of abducens vulnerability from an evolutionary perspective. The petroclival region and the Dorello's canal in particular were examined in a sample of 86 primate skulls. The sample contains 20 Pan troglodytes (common chimpanzee), 35 Gorilla gorilla, 20 Pongo pygmaeus (orangoutan), and 11 Hylobates moloch (gibbon) skulls. Distance between the petrous apex and tip of the posterior clinoid process was measured using a 10-mm scale that was inserted into the endocranium. Complete absence of the Gruber ligament and an uninterrupted osseous circumference of the Dorello's canal (foramen) was demonstrated in all nonhuman primate species. Whatever the reason for the morphological difference between the human and ape Dorello's canal, it is without a doubt suggestive of the source of vulnerability of the abducens nerve, as the ligament of Gruber, unique to the human configuration, renders the contents of the Dorello's canal susceptible to compression against the cranial base."

The evolution of menopause in cetaceans and humans: the role of demography,"['Johnstone, RA', 'Cant, MA']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rspb.2010.0988,DEC 22 2010,48,"Human females stop reproducing long before they die. Among other mammals, only pilot and killer whales exhibit a comparable period of post-reproductive life. The grandmother hypothesis suggests that kin selection can favour post-reproductive survival when older females help their relatives to reproduce. But although there is an evidence that grandmothers can provide such assistance, it is puzzling why menopause should have evolved only among the great apes and toothed whales. We have previously suggested (Cant & Johnstone 2008 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 105, 5332-5336 (doi:10.1073/pnas.0711911105)) that relatedness asymmetries owing to female-biased dispersal in ancestral humans would have favoured younger females in reproductive competition with older females, predisposing our species to the evolution of menopause. But this argument appears inapplicable to menopausal cetaceans, which exhibit philopatry of both sexes combined with extra-group mating. Here, we derive general formulae for 'kinship dynamics', the age-related changes in local relatedness that occur in long-lived social organisms as a consequence of dispersal and mortality. We show that the very different social structures of great apes and menopausal whales both give rise to an increase in local relatedness with female age, favouring late-life helping. Our analysis can therefore help to explain why, of all long-lived, social mammals, it is specifically among the great apes and toothed whales that menopause and post-reproductive helping have evolved."
Genome Digging: Insight into the Mitochondrial Genome of Homo,"['Ovchinnikov, IV', 'Kholina, OI']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0014278,DEC 9 2010,4,"Background: A fraction of the Neanderthal mitochondrial genome sequence has a similarity with a 5,839-bp nuclear DNA sequence of mitochondrial origin (numt) on the human chromosome 1. This fact has never been interpreted. Although this phenomenon may be attributed to contamination and mosaic assembly of Neanderthal mtDNA from short sequencing reads, we explain the mysterious similarity by integration of this numt (mtAncestor-1) into the nuclear genome of the common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans not long before their reproductive split.

Principal Findings: Exploiting bioinformatics, we uncovered an additional numt (mtAncestor-2) with a high similarity to the Neanderthal mtDNA and indicated that both numts represent almost identical replicas of the mtDNA sequences ancestral to the mitochondrial genomes of Neanderthals and modern humans. In the proteins, encoded by mtDNA, the majority of amino acids distinguishing chimpanzees from humans and Neanderthals were acquired by the ancestral hominins. The overall rate of nonsynonymous evolution in Neanderthal mitochondrial protein-coding genes is not higher than in other lineages. The model incorporating the ancestral hominin mtDNA sequences estimates the average divergence age of the mtDNAs of Neanderthals and modern humans to be 450,000-485,000 years. The mtAncestor-1 and mtAncestor-2 sequences were incorporated into the nuclear genome approximately 620,000 years and 2,885,000 years ago, respectively.

Conclusions: This study provides the first insight into the evolution of the mitochondrial DNA in hominins ancestral to Neanderthals and humans. We hypothesize that mtAncestor-1 and mtAncestor-2 are likely to be molecular fossils of the mtDNAs of Homo heidelbergensis and a stem Homo lineage. The d(N)/d(S) dynamics suggests that the effective population size of extinct hominins was low. However, the hominin lineage ancestral to humans, Neanderthals and H. heidelbergensis, had a larger effective population size and possessed genetic diversity comparable with those of chimpanzee and gorilla."

Seventeen parasite species were recovered, including eight nematodes (Oesophagostomum sp., Necator sp., Probst-mayria gombensis, Strongyloides fulleborni, Ascaris sp., Trichuris sp., Abbreviata caucasica, and an unidentified strongyle), 1 cestode (Bertiella sp.), 1 trematode (Dicrocoeliidae), and 7 protozoa (Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, Iodamoeba butschlii, Troglodytella abrassarti, Troglocorys cava, Balantidium coli, and an unidentified protozoa). Significant differences were observed in interannual infection prevalence and parasite richness between 2006 and 2007. Intercommunity comparisons demonstrated higher prevalence of parasites for the Mitumba compared with Kasekela chimpanzee community. Prevalence of several parasites was strongly correlated with monthly rainfall patterns for both 2006 and 2007. Subadult chimpanzees had lower prevalence for most parasite species compared with adults in both years and also yielded a lower average parasite species richness. No significant differences were observed between males and females in prevalence in 2006. However, in 2007 the prevalence of S. fulleborni and I. butschlii were higher in males than in females. Parasite prevalence and richness were substantially higher in this multiyear study compared with previous short-term studies of the gastrointestinal parasites of Gombe chimpanzees. This coupled with the significant interannual and interseasonal variation, demonstrated in this study, emphasizes the importance of multiyear monitoring with adequate sample size to effectively determine patterns of parasitism in wild primate populations.

(Am J Phys Anthropol 135 (2008) 216-224), this study quantifies the first metatarsal proximal articular surface using three-dimensional morphometrics to test for differences in articular surface shape between habitually shod and habitually unshod humans. In addition, differences in shape between Homo, Pan, Gorilla, and Hylobates are compared to the fossil hominin specimens A. L. 333-54, Stw 562, Stw 573 (""Little Foot''), OH 8, SKX 5017, and SK 1813. No difference in surface shape was found between habitually shod and habitually unshod humans. There is a clear quantitative division in articular surface shape between humans and apes that is more pronounced than a previous study by Proctor et al. (Am J Phys Anthropol 135 (2008) 216-224), due to additional landmarks present in this study. The specimen OH 8 is indistinguishable from modern Homo. The fossils A. L. 333-54, Stw 562, and Stw 573 are intermediate in shape between humans and apes. The specimens SKX 5017 and SK 1813 have a more apelike articular surface. When combined with other characteristics, this trait suggests that Paranthropus used a degree of abduction during locomotion that was much less than that in extant apes, but greater than that in Australopithecus, allowing for some small degree of grasping ability.

"Specific Gravity and Creatinine as Corrections for Variation in Urine Concentration in Humans, Gorillas, and Woolly Monkeys","['White, BC', 'Jamison, KM', 'Grieb, C', 'Lally, D', 'Luckett, C', 'Kramer, KS', 'Phillips, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20867,DEC 2010,9,"\ Hormones excreted in the urine are widely used to assess the physiological and psychological condition of unrestrained animals. In order to control for variation in the water concentration of urine samples, the hormone concentration is often indexed to the concentration of creatinine. Because there are several problems with using creatinine, we have investigated the efficacy of specific gravity as an alternative basis for adjusting the hormone concentration in humans, gorillas, and woolly monkeys. In an experimental manipulation of human urine hydration, ten volunteers drank a water load proportional to body weight, and provided complete urine collection and saliva samples for four consecutive 20 min intervals. From the urine, we measured cortisol (radioimmunoassay), creatinine (colorimetric assay), and specific gravity (refractometer). Only cortisol was assayed from saliva. During 80 min following water ingestion, cortisol, creatinine, and specific gravity declined as urine became diluted; however, total cortisol excretion remained constant. Only cortisol concentration indexed to specific gravity accurately reflected the consistent cortisol excretion. Specific gravity and creatinine-corrected cortisol values were highly correlated but were significantly different. Salivary cortisol provided evidence for the relative stability of serum cortisol. To determine the utility of these corrections in other primates, we compared specific gravity-and creatinine-corrected cortisol in urine samples from captive gorillas (N = 16) and woolly monkeys (N = 8). As with the human study, the two corrections were strongly correlated in each species, but the means were different. Specific gravity correction was superior in revealing the circadian variation in cortisol. Am. J. Primatol. 72:1082-1091, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
A comparison of bonobo and chimpanzee tool use: evidence for a female bias in the Pan lineage,"['Gruber, T', 'Clay, Z', 'Zuberbuhler, K']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.09.005,DEC 2010,25,"Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, are the most sophisticated tool-users among all nonhuman primates. From an evolutionary perspective, it is therefore puzzling that the tool use behaviour of their closest living primate relative, the bonobo, Pan paniscus, has been described as particularly poor. However, only a small number of bonobo groups have been studied in the wild and only over comparably short periods. Here, we show that captive bonobos and chimpanzees are equally diverse tool-users inmost contexts. Our observations illustrate that tool use in bonobos can be highly complex and no different from what has been described for chimpanzees. The only major difference in the chimpanzee and bonobo data was that bonobos of all age-sex classes used tools in a play context, a possible manifestation of their neotenous nature. We also found that female bonobos displayed a larger range of tool use behaviours than males, a pattern previously described for chimpanzees but not for other great apes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the female-biased tool use evolved prior to the split between bonobos and chimpanzees. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

What does seed handling by the drill tell us about the ecological services of terrestrial cercopithecines in African forests?,"['Astaras, C', 'Waltert, M']",ANIMAL CONSERVATION,10.1111/j.1469-1795.2010.00378.x,DEC 2010,7,"The contribution of primates to the seed rain in tropical forests has been long recognized, and there is evidence that these services are not compensated for by other frugivores in the event of primate extirpations. Given the vulnerability of large rainforest frugivores to hunting and the crisis dimensions that commercial hunting is taking in much of tropical Africa, studies on the seed handling of terrestrial cercopithecine primates are especially timely and needed in order to understand their role in maintaining plant community dynamics. Unlike arboreal species, terrestrial primates handle seeds at the post-dispersal stage of fruits and their populations are among the first to decline due to hunting pressure. We analyzed, for the first time, the year-round seed handling of the drill Mandrillus leucophaeus, an endangered terrestrial primate, by examining feeding remains and feces collected over 3284 km of patrols in Korup National Park, Cameroon. Drills defecated intact 110 seeds of diverse plant, fruit and seed traits primarily during periods of fruit abundance, and increased their seed predation during the pronounced fruit-scarce dry season. Considering the drill's diverse fruit diet, ground foraging, long day ranges and seed handling, we suggest that forest-dwelling terrestrial cercopithecines differ in their impact on seed deposition patterns compared with sympatric arboreal primates. Our findings emphasize the need to better assess the impact of terrestrial cercopithecines on plant community dynamics in Africa, warn of potential ecological process disruptions in the event of their extirpation and make a case for rethinking primate conservation priorities so that they do not only reflect a species' dire population status but also the impact its loss would entail for the ecosystem."
Apes in a changing world - the effects of global warming on the behaviour and distribution of African apes,"['Lehmann, J', 'Korstjens, AH', 'Dunbar, RIM']",JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02373.x,DEC 2010,13,"Aim

In this study we use a modelling approach to identify: (1) the factors responsible for the differences in ape biogeography, (2) the effects that global warming might have on distribution patterns of African apes, (3) the underlying mechanisms for these effects, and (4) the implications that behavioural flexibility might be expected to have for ape survival. All African apes are highly endangered, and the need for efficient conservation methods is a top priority. The expected changes in world climate are likely to further exacerbate the difficulties they face. Our study aims to further understand the mechanisms that link climatic conditions to the behaviour and biogeography of ape species.

Location

Africa.

Method

We use an existing validated time budgets model, derived from data on 20 natural populations of gorillas (Gorilla beringei and Gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus), which specifies the relationship between climate, group size, body weight and time available for various activities, to predict ape distribution across Africa under a uniform worst-case climate change scenario.

Results

We demonstrate that a worst-case global warming scenario is likely to alter the delicate balance between different time budget components. Our model points to the importance of annual temperature variation, which was found to have the strongest impact on ape biogeography. Our simulation indicates that rising temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns are likely to have strong effects on ape survival and distribution, particularly for gorillas. Even if they behaved with maximum flexibility, gorillas may not be able to survive in most of their present habitats if the climate was to undergo extreme changes. The survival of chimpanzees was found to be strongly dependent on the minimum viable group size required.

Main conclusions

Our model allows us to explore how climatic conditions, individual behaviour and morphological traits may interact to limit the biogeographical distributions of these species, thereby allowing us to predict the effects of climate change on African ape distributions under different climate change regimes. The model suggests that climate variability (i.e. seasonality) plays a more important role than the absolute magnitude of the change, but these data are not normally provided by climate models."

Samples were analyzed with the use of Sheather's flotation and merthiolate iodine formaldehyde (MIFC) sedimentation. MIFC sedimentation was the more sensitive technique for diagnostics of B. coli in apes. Although not detected in any wild-ape populations, B. coli was diagnosed in 52.6% of captive individuals. Surprisingly, in the apes' feces, trophozoites of B. coli were commonly detected, in contrast with other animals, e.g., Old World monkeys, pigs, etc. Most likely reservoirs for B. coli in captive apes include synantropic rats. High starch diets in captive apes are likely to exacerbate the occurrence of balantidiasis in captive apes."

Molecular anthropologists often point to this early research as a critical step in establishing their new specialty. Based on his molecular results, Goodman challenged the widely accepted taxonomic classification that separated humans from chimpanzees and gorillas in two separate families. His claim that chimpanzees and gorillas should join humans in family Hominidae sparked a well-known conflict with George Gaylord Simpson, Ernst Mayr, and other prominent evolutionary biologists. Less well known, but equally significant, were a series of disagreements between Goodman and other prominent molecular evolutionists concerning both methodological and theoretical issues. These included qualitative versus quantitative data, the role of natural selection, rates of evolution, and the reality of molecular clocks. These controversies continued throughout Goodman's career, even as he moved from immunological techniques to protein and DNA sequence analysis. This episode highlights the diversity of methods used by molecular evolutionists and the conflicting conclusions drawn from the data that these methods generated."

We identified a novel AdV in the feces of captive gorillas by isolation in cell culture, electron microscopy and PCR. From the supernatants of infected cultures we amplified DNA polymerase (DPOL), preterminal protein (pTP) and hexon gene sequences with generic pan primate AdV PCR assays. The sequences in-between were amplified by long-distance PCRs of 2 - 10 kb length, resulting in a final sequence of 15.6 kb. Phylogenetic analysis placed the novel gorilla AdV into a cluster of primate AdVs belonging to the species Human adenovirus B (HAdV-B). Depending on the analyzed gene, its position within the cluster was variable. To further elucidate its origin, feces samples of wild gorillas were analyzed. AdV hexon sequences were detected which are indicative for three distinct and novel gorilla HAdV-B viruses, among them a virus nearly identical to the novel AdV isolated from captive gorillas. This shows that the discovered virus is a member of a group of HAdV-B viruses that naturally infect gorillas. The mixed phylogenetic clusters of gorilla, chimpanzee, bonobo and human AdVs within the HAdV-B species indicate that host switches may have been a component of the evolution of human and non-human primate HAdV-B viruses."

Ape Behavior in Two Alternating Environments: Comparing Exhibit and Short-Term Holding Areas,"['Ross, SR', 'Wagner, KE', 'Schapiro, SJ', 'Hau, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20857,NOV 2010,9,"In many facilities, primates are voluntarily transferred between different enclosures on a daily basis to facilitate animal husbandry and exhibit maintenance. This procedure is particularly relevant in the management of great apes living in zoos, where the requirements of functional management must be balanced with the desire to maintain enriching and naturalistic exhibit enclosures that benefit ape residents and attract the visiting public. In these settings, examinations of ape behavior and welfare typically focus exclusively on activity in the primary exhibit area. However, physical, social and sensory experiences unique to each area may shape different patterns of behavior. In the current study, zoo-living chimpanzees and gorillas were moved each day from exhibit areas to off-exhibit holding areas for a short duration as a part of regular management procedures. Behavioral data indicated species-specific reactions to the holding area, including increased aggression and self-directed behavior by chimpanzees and increased activity and prosocial behavior among gorilla subjects. Both species showed more feeding-foraging behavior while in the exhibit enclosure. Results suggest that holding areas may not meet all behavior needs of captive great apes and demonstrate the importance of including all components of the captive enclosure in comprehensive analyses of great ape behavior and welfare.

Semantics of primate gestures: intentional meanings of orangutan gestures,"['Cartmill, EA', 'Byrne, RW']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-010-0328-7,NOV 2010,31,"Great ape gesture has become a research topic of intense interest, because its intentionality and flexibility suggest strong parallels to human communication. Yet the fundamental question of whether an animal species' gestures carry specific meanings has hardly been addressed. We set out a systematic approach to studying intentional meaning in the gestural communication of non-humans and apply it to a sample of orangutan gestures. We propose that analysis of meaning should be limited to gestures for which (1) there is strong evidence for intentional production and (2) the recipient's final reaction matches the presumed goal of the signaller, as determined independently. This produces a set of ""successful"" instances of gesture use, which we describe as having goal-outcome matches. In this study, 28 orangutans in three European zoos were observed for 9 months. We distinguished 64 gestures on structural grounds, 40 of which had frequent goal-outcome matches and could therefore be analysed for meaning. These 40 gestures were used predictably to achieve one of 6 social goals: to initiate an affiliative interaction (contact, grooming, or play), request objects, share objects, instigate co-locomotion, cause the partner to move back, or stop an action. Twenty-nine of these gestures were used consistently with a single meaning. We tested our analysis of gesture meaning by examining what gesturers did when the response to their gesture did not match the gesture's meaning. Subsequent actions of the gesturer were consistent with our assignments of meaning to gestures. We suggest that, despite their contextual flexibility, orangutan gestures are made with the expectation of specific behavioural responses and thus have intentional meanings as well as functional consequences."
Estimating Orangutan Densities Using the Standing Crop and Marked Nest Count Methods: Lessons Learned for Conservation,"['Spehar, SN', 'Mathewson, PD', 'Nuzuar', 'Wich, SA', 'Marshall, AJ', 'Kuhl, H', 'Nardiyono', 'Meijaard, E']",BIOTROPICA,10.1111/j.1744-7429.2010.00651.x,NOV 2010,6,"Reliable estimates of great ape abundance are needed to assess distribution, monitor population status, evaluate conservation tactics, and identify priority populations for conservation. Rather than using direct counts, surveyors often count ape nests. The standing crop nest count (SCNC) method converts the standing stock of nests into animal densities using a set of parameters, including nest decay rate. Nest decay rates vary greatly over space and time, and it takes months to calculate a site-specific value. The marked nest count (MNC) method circumvents this issue and only counts new nests produced during a defined period. We compared orangutan densities calculated by the two methods using data from studies in Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia. We show how animal densities calculated using nest counts should be cautiously interpreted when used to make decisions about management or budget allocation. Even with site-specific decay rates, short studies using the SCNC method may not accurately reflect the current population unless conducted at a scale sufficient to include wide-ranging orangutan movement. Density estimates from short studies using the MNC method were affected by small sample sizes and by orangutan movement. To produce reliable results, the MNC method may require a similar amount of effort as the SCNC method. We suggest a reduced reliance on the traditional line transect surveys in favor of feasible alternative methods when absolute abundance numbers are not necessary or when site-specific nest decay rates are not known. Given funding constraints, aerial surveys, reconnaissance walks, and interview techniques may be more cost-effective means of accomplishing some survey goals."
"Lac Tele structure, Republic of Congo Geological setting of a cryptozoological and biodiversity hotspot, and evidence against an impact origin","['Master, S']",JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES,10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2009.07.017,NOV 2010,2,"Lac Tele is a large lake similar to 5 6 km in diameter with an ovoid shape situated at 17 degrees 10 E 1 degrees 20'N in the great tropical rain forest region of the Republic of Congo This lake has attracted widespread attention mainly because of the legends among the local people that it harbours a strange animal known as the Mokele Mbembe but also because it is situated in a region that is a hotbed of biodiversity and conservation efforts with respect to various endangered mammalian species including gorillas and chimpanzees Because of its appearance Lac Tele has been regarded as a possible meteorite impact structure Various expeditions studying cryptozoology conservation ecology biodiversity and the impact hypothesis have visited Lac Tele in the past several decades

The Lac Tele structure is located in the NW part of the intracratonic Congo Basin in a region dominated by Holocene alluvium dense tropical rain forest and swamps which form part of the basin of the Likouala aux Herbes a multi-branched meandering river flowing over very low gradients into the Sangha river a major tributary of the Congo river Previous bathymetric studies have shown that the average depth of Lac Tele is only 4 m including organic rich silty sediments The structure is that of a flat-bottomed dish

Model ling of the Lac Tele as an impact structure indicates a number of features which ought to be present The absence of any of these features coupled with the irregular ovoid shape the palynological record and the location of the structure at the intersection of major regional lineaments is regarded as evidence against the Impact hypothesis

Lac Tele as an isolated lake ecosystem is not unique in the Congo Basin and there are several other similar small shallow isolated lakes surrounded by rain forest and marshes some of which formed by damming of drainage systems by neotectonic faults It is suggested that the formation of Lac Tele may be related to its location over neotectonically reactivated regional lineaments which are also seismically active Lac Tele and other similar hydrologic systems may be biodiversity hotspots because they acted as refugia following neotectonic hydrological re-organization of the Congo Basin (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved"
The role of social meaning in inattentional blindness: When the gorillas in our midst do not go unseen,"['Rattan, A', 'Eberhardt, JL']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1016/j.jesp.2010.06.010,NOV 2010,3,"Without visual attention, even the obvious-like a gorilla walking through a scene of people-goes undetected (Mack & Rock, 1998; Simons & Chabris, 1999). This ""inattentional blindness"" is a persistent, well-documented limitation of the human visual system. The current research examines whether social meaning reduces this visual bias by imbuing unexpected objects with signal value, thus increasing their relevance and facilitating perception. Using one of the most established illustrations of inattentional blindness, we show for the first time that activating a social association, even an erroneous one (i.e., the African American-ape association), drastically attenuates inattentional blindness. This is not accounted for by visual feature matching. Rather, these results suggest that social meaning, even when flawed, may direct our visual system towards associated visual information that would otherwise be overlooked. As such, these results provide a powerful replication of the African American-ape association and illustrate that this broadly held association has the power to spontaneously change the content of one's visual world.

Inference for the Initial Stage of Domain Shuffling: Tracing the Evolutionary Fate of the PIPSL Retrogene in Hominoids,"['Ohshima, K', 'Igarashi, K']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msq138,NOV 2010,6,"We present the first evidence for the translation of PIPSL in humans. The human PIPSL locus showed a low nucleotide diversity within 11 populations (125 individuals) compared with other genomic regions such as introns and overall chromosomes. It was equivalent to the average for coding sequences or exons from other genes, suggesting that human PIPSL has some function and is conserved among modern populations. Two linked amino acid-altering single-nucleotide polymorphisms were found in the PIPSL kinase domain of non-African populations. They are positioned in the vicinity of the substrate-binding cavity of the parental PIP5K1A protein and change the charge of both residues. The relatively rapid expansion of this haplotype might indicate a selective advantage for it in modern humans.

We determined the evolutionary fate of PIPSL domains created by domain shuffling. During hominoid diversification, the S5a-derived domain was retained in all lineages, whereas the ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) 1 in the domain experienced critical amino acid replacements at an early stage, being conserved under subsequent high levels of nonsynonymous substitutions to UIM2 and other domains, suggesting that adaptive evolution diversified these functional compartments. Conversely, the PIP5K1A-derived domain is degenerated in gibbons and gorillas. These observations provide a possible scheme of domain shuffling in which the combined parental domains are not tightly linked in the novel chimeric protein, allowing for changes in their functional roles, leading to their fine-tuning. Selective pressure toward a novel function initially acted on one domain, whereas the other experienced a nearly neutral state. Over time, the latter also gained a new function or was degenerated."

Central to the diagnosis of K. platyops is the morphology of the maxilla, characterized by a flat and relatively orthognathic subnasal region, anteriorly placed zygomatic processes and small molars. To study this morphology in more detail, we compare the maxillae of African Plio-Pleistocene hominin fossils and samples of modern humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, using conventional and geometric morphometric methods. Computed tomography scans and detailed preparation of the KNM-WT 40000 maxilla enable comprehensive assessment of post-mortem changes, so that landmark data characterizing the morphology can be corrected for distortion. Based on a substantially larger comparative sample than previously available, the results of statistical analyses show that KNM-WT 40000 is indeed significantly different from and falls outside the known range of variation of species of Australopithecus and Paranthropus, contemporary Australopithecus afarensis in particular. These results support the attribution of KNM-WT 40000 to a separate species and the notion that hominin taxonomic diversity in Africa extends back well into the Middle Pliocene."
Retrieving chronological age from dental remains of early fossil hominins to reconstruct human growth in the past,"['Dean, MC', 'SOUTH-AFRICAN AUSTRALOPITHECINES']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2010.0052,OCT 27 2010,28,"A chronology of dental development in Pan troglodytes is arguably the best available model with which to compare and contrast reconstructed dental chronologies of the earliest fossil hominins. Establishing a time scale for growth is a requirement for being able to make further comparative observations about timing and rate during both dento-skeletal growth and brain growth. The absolute timing of anterior tooth crown and root formation appears not to reflect the period of somatic growth. In contrast, the molar dentition best reflects changes to the total growth period. Earlier initiation of molar mineralization, shorter crown formation times, less root length formed at gingival emergence into functional occlusion are cumulatively expressed as earlier ages at molar eruption. Things that are similar in modern humans and Pan, such as the total length of time taken to form individual teeth, raise expectations that these would also have been the same in fossil hominins. The best evidence there is from the youngest fossil hominin specimens suggests a close resemblance to the model for Pan but also hints that Gorilla may be a better developmental model for some. A mosaic of great ape-like features currently best describes the timing of early hominin dental development."

The article shows how international studies have been insufficiently sensitive to the strategic role of global cities and how they are capable of acting on the global stage by exerting network power. This sheds light on the multilayered governmentality of global governance from an urban perspective. Looking through a lens of global cities, it is argued, will enable theorists to connect macro processes to micro dynamics across a far wider spectrum of governance and political agencies."

Monkeys and Apes: Are Their Cognitive Skills Really So Different?,"['Amici, F', 'Aureli, F', 'Call, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21305,OCT 2010,21,"Differences in cognitive skills across taxa, and between monkeys and apes in particular, have been explained by different hypotheses, although these often are not supported by systematic interspecific comparisons. Here, we directly compared the cognitive performance of the four great apes and three monkey species (spider monkeys, capuchin monkeys, and long-tailed macaques), differing in their phylogenetic-relatedness and socioecology. We tested subjects on their ability to remember object locations (memory task), track object displacements (transposition task), and obtain out-of-reach rewards (support task). Our results showed no support for an overall clear-cut distinction in cognitive skills between monkeys and apes as species performance varied substantially across tasks. Although we found differences in performance at tracking object displacements between monkeys and apes, interspecific differences in the other two tasks were better explained in terms of differential socioecology, especially differential levels of fission-fusion dynamics. A cluster analysis using mean scores of each condition of the three tasks for each species suggested that the only dichotomy might be between members of the genus Pan and the rest of the tested species. These findings evidence the importance of using multiple tasks across multiple species in a comparative perspective to test different explanations for the enhancement of specific cognitive skills.

Articular to Diaphyseal Proportions of Human and Great Ape Metatarsals,"['Marchi, D', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21306,OCT 2010,3,"This study proposes a new way to use metatarsals to identify locomotor behavior of fossil hominins. Metatarsal head articular dimensions and diaphyseal strength in a sample of chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and humans (n = 76) are used to explore the relationships of these parameters with different locomotor modes. Results show that ratios between metatarsal head articular proportions and diaphyseal strength of the hallucal and fifth metatarsal discriminate among extant great apes and humans based on their different locomotor modes. In particular, the hallucal and fifth metatarsal characteristics of humans are functionally related to the different ranges of motion and load patterns during stance phase in the forefoot of humans in bipedal locomotion. This method may be applicable to isolated fossil hominin metatarsals to provide new information relevant to debates regarding the evolution of human bipedal locomotion. The second to fourth metatarsals are not useful in distinguishing among hominoids. Further studies should concentrate on measuring other important qualitative and quantitative differences in the shape of the metatarsal head of hominoids that are not reflected in simple geometric reconstructions of the articulation, and gathering more forefoot kinematic data on great apes to better understand differences in range of motion and loading patterns of the metatarsals.

The goal of the current study was to assess the relative orientations of the orbits, palate, and basioccipital clivus among the hylobatid genera in an effort to further clarify whether the lesser apes differ significantly in these internal cranial features and how that variation patterns across the groups. Nine angular variables quantifying orbital, palatal, and basioccipital clivus orientations were measured on lateral view radiographs of adults representing three of the four hylobatid genera: Hylobates; Nomascus; and, Symphalangus. The interspecific adult hylobatid means for the angular variables were analyzed using t-test contrasts. The total sample was further subjected to discriminant function analysis (DFA) to test for the ability of craniofacial angular variables to distinguish the hylobatid genera from one another. The three hylobatid genera displayed significant morphological differentiation in orbital, palatal, and posterior skull base orientations. Normal, jackknifed, and cross-validation DFA procedures correctly identified the hylobatids 50-100% of the time. The observed morphological patterns generally mapped onto the findings of earlier external craniometric hylobatid studies and suggest concordance between specific internal and external cranial features. This article is the first comprehensive study of variation in internal cranial anatomy of the Hylobatidae and includes the first published craniofacial angular data for Nomascus.

"Behavioral Responses of One Western Lowland Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) Group at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic, to Tourists, Researchers and Trackers","['Klailova, M', 'Hodgkinson, C', 'Lee, PC']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20829,OCT 2010,12,"Gorilla tourism, widely perceived as a lucrative industry, is propelled by strong market demand with programs in five countries and for three of four gorilla subspecies. Human presence may negatively affect wild gorillas, potentially lowering immunity and increasing the likelihood of acquiring human-borne disease. Yet, behavioral impacts of humans on wild gorilla behavior remain largely unexplored, particularly for western lowland gorillas. We evaluate the impact of tourist presence, human observer numbers (tourists, trackers, and researchers), and human observer distance on the behavior of one habituated gorilla group at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic. Behavioral data were collected for more than 12 months from January 2007. Of silverback aggressive events, 39% (N = 229) were human directed, but 65% were low-level soft barks. Adult females, and one in particular, were responsible for the highest number of aggressive events toward humans. Humans maintained closer proximity to the silverback when tourists were present, although tourist numbers had no significant impact on overall group activity budgets or rates of human-directed aggression. However, as research team size increased, group feeding rates decreased. Close observer-silverback distance correlated with a decrease in his feeding rates and an increase in human monitoring. He directed less aggression toward observers at distances 410 m, although observers spent 48.5% of time between 6 and 10 m of the silverback. We discuss gorilla personality as a factor in human-directed aggression. We explore whether the current 7 m distance limit governing gorilla tourism, based on disease transmission risks, is sufficient considering the potential behavioral stressor of close human presence. We recommend increasing minimum observation distance to >10 m where possible, decreasing observer group sizes, particularly after a visit consisting of maximum numbers and restricting tourist access to 1 visit/day.

Data were collected during 115 encounters between May 2006 and January 2008. Individual responses were recorded during the first minute of visual contact. The most common responses were ""ignore'' for arboreal chimpanzees and ""monitor'' for terrestrial individuals. Chimpanzees rarely responded with ""flight''. Adult males were seen disproportionately often relative to adult females, and accounted for 90% of individual responses recorded for terrestrial animals. Entire encounters were also categorized based on the predominant response of the chimpanzee party to researcher proximity. The most frequent encounter type was ""ignore'' (36%), followed by ""monitor'' (21%), ""intimidation'' (18%) and "" stealthy retreat'' (18%). "" Intimidation'' encounters occurred when chimpanzees were contacted in dense forest where visibility was low, provoking intense alarm and agitation. Adult males occasionally acted together to repel researchers through aggressive mobbing and pursuit. Chimpanzee behavior during encounters reflects the familiar yet frequently agonistic relationship between apes and local people at Bulindi. The chimpanzees are not hunted but experience high levels of harassment from villagers. Human-directed aggression by chimpanzees may represent a strategy to accommodate regular disruptions to foraging effort arising from competitive encounters with people both in and outside forest. Average encounter duration and proportion of encounters categorized as ""ignore'' increased over time, whereas ""intimidation'' encounters decreased, indicating some habituation occurred during the study. Ecotourism aimed at promoting tolerance of wildlife through local revenue generation is one possible strategy for conserving great apes on public or private land. However, the data imply that habituating chimpanzees for viewing-based ecotourism in heavily human-dominated landscapes, such as Bulindi, is ill-advised since a loss of fear of humans could lead to increased negative interactions with local people.

Chromosomal Dynamics in Cercopithecini Studied by Williams-Beuren probe mapping,"['Dumas, F', 'Sineo, L']",CARYOLOGIA,NA,OCT-DEC 2010,1,"Chromosomal evolution in the tribe Cercopithecini and in related taxa is highly debated. Uncertainty in reconstruction is mainly related to the great genetic variability and polymorphism of the taxa. Recent molecular and karyological efforts individuate a split between genetically conservative, arbitrarily defined, ""terrestrial"" guenons and vervets, and genetically variable and derived ""arboreal"" guenons. We performed the mapping of WS loci probe (7q11.23) in order to verify the chromosomal dynamics of the genomes of three tree-dwelling species of the tribe: C. neglectus, C. mitis mitis, C. albogularis labiatus. Data from literature for the ground-dwelling"" Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus has been compared with our results.

The distribution of the WS probe showed a high genomic dynamics in the different species, with three different pattern of rearrangements. Starting from the ancestral synteny 7 found in Pongo pygmaeus (PPY), the present mapping demonstrates different location of the hybridizations signals. A parsimonious interpretation lead to the hypothesis that a pericentric inversion transformed the PPY orthologous in C. neglectus. The C. mitis and the strictly related C. a. labiatus demonstrate more complex, and derivative, rearrangements. According to the position of the WS signal, and to banding pattern analysis, C. mitis and C. albogoularis, underwent to the pericentric inversion, followed by a paracentric inversion and a successive interstitial fission that fragmented the synteny. Starting from the PPY like orthologous a single and independent event, a centric fission, that did not affect the WS position, occurred in Ch. aethiops producing a Gorilla gorilla like chromosome.

Our results confirm the hypothesis that chromosomal dynamics in Cercopithecini proceed by fissions and inversions and indicate the usefulness of the locus specific mapping approach for the identification of intrachromosome rearrangements."

The milks of these species contained 6-8% total sugar, most of which was lactose: the estimated ratio of oligosaccharides to lactose in Old World monkeys (1:4 to 1:6) was greater than in New World monkeys (1:12 to 1:23). The chemical structures of the oligosaccharides were determined mainly by H-1-NMR spectroscopy. Oligosaccharides containing the type II unit (Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc) were found in the milk of the rhesus macaque, toque macaque, Hamadryas baboon and tufted capuchin, but oligosaccharides containing the type I unit (Gal(beta 1-3)GlcNAc), which have been found in human and many great ape milks, were absent from the milk of all species studied. Oligosaccharides containing Lewis x (Gal(beta 1-4)[Fuc(alpha 1-3)]GlcNAc) and 3-fucosyl lactose (3-FL, Gal(beta 1-4)[Fuc(alpha 1-3)]Glc) were found in the milk of the three cercopithecid monkey species, while 2-fucosyl lactose (5'-FL, Fuc(alpha 1-2)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc) was absent from all species studied. All of these milks contained acidic oligosaccharides that had N-acetylneuraminic acid as part of their structures, but did not contain oligosaccharides that had N-glycolylneuraminic acid, in contrast to the milk or colostrum of great apes which contain both types of acidic oligosaccharides. Two GalNAc-containing oligosaccharides, lactose 3'-O-sulfate and lacto-N-novopentaose I (Gal(beta 1-3)[Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-6)]Gal(beta 1-4)Glc) were found only in the milk of rhesus macaque, hamadryas baboon and tufted capuchin, respectively.

Over a 3-yr period we monitored the gastrointestinal parasites of 3 primate species living in the isolated ecosystem of Rubondo Island National Park, Tanzania: translocated chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and guerezas (Colobus guereza) and the indigenous vervets (Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus). We detected Troglodytella abrassarti and Enterobius cf. anthropopitheci only in chimpanzees and Chilomastix mesnili in chimpanzees and guerezas. In vervets, we recorded Anatrichosoma sp. and Subulura sp., previously reported in Rubondo chimpanzees. We found Blastocystis sp., Giardia sp., Iodamoeba buetschlii, Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba spp., Trichuris sp., Strongyloides spp., spirurids (cf. Protospirura muricola), and undetermined strongylids in all 3 primate species. Considering the absence of Protospirura muricola in other wild populations of chimpanzees and guerezas, it has probably been acquired from the native vervets, as have Anatrichosoma sp. and Subulura sp. Lower parasite load in Rubondo chimpanzees, in comparison with wild populations at other study sites of this species, might be due to their stay in captivity in Europe before being released on the island. Despite a lack of any apparent health problems from infections in introduced Rubondo primates, parasite monitoring during reintroduction/introduction projects is necessary to decrease potential risks resulting from the exchange of parasites between translocated and native species."

However, little is known about whether choices are solely based on familiarity with the materials or knowledge about tool properties. Furthermore, it is unclear whether tool manipulation is required prior to selection or whether observation alone can suffice. We investigated whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) (n = 9). bonobos (Pan paniscus)(n = 4), orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) (n = 6), and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) (n = 2) selected new tools on the basis of their rigidity. Subjects faced an out-of-reach reward and a choice of three tools differing in color, diameter, material, and rigidity. We used 10 different 3-tool sets ( I rigid, 2 flexible). Subjects were unfamiliar with the tools and needed to select and use the rigid tool to retrieve the reward. Experiment I showed that subjects chose the rigid tool from the first trial with a 90% success rate. Experiments 2a and 2b addressed the role of manipulation and observation in tool selection. Subjects performed equally well in conditions in which they could manipulate the tools themselves or saw the experimenter manipulate the tools but decreased their performance if they could only visually inspect the tools. Experiment 3 showed that subjects could select flexible tools (as opposed to rigid ones) to meet new task demands. We conclude that great apes spontaneously selected unfamiliar rigid or flexible tools even after gathering minimal observational information."

Using a robust, sensitive assay of KIR binding and a representative panel of 95 HLA class I targets, we show that KIR2DS1 binds C2 with similar to 50% the avidity of KIR2DL1, whereas KIR2DS2, KIR2DS3, and KIR2DS5 have no detectable avidity for C1, C2, or any other HLA class I epitope. In contrast, the chimpanzee has activating C1- and C2-specific lineage III KIR with strong avidity, comparable to those of their paired inhibitory receptors. One variant of chimpanzee Pt-KIR3DS2, the activating C2-specific receptor, has the same avidity for C2 as does inhibitory Pt-KIR3DL4, and a second variant has similar to 73% the avidity. Chimpanzee Pt-KIR3DS6, the activating C1-specific receptor, has avidity for C1 that is similar to 70% that of inhibitory Pt-KIR2DL6. In both humans and chimpanzees we observe an evolutionary trend toward reducing the avidity of the activating C1- and C2-specific receptors through selective acquisition of attenuating substitutions. However, the extent of attenuation has been extreme in humans, as exemplified by KIR2DS2, an activating C1-specific receptor that has lost all detectable avidity for HLA class I. Supporting such elimination of activating C1-specific receptors as a uniquely human phenomenon is the presence of a high-avidity activating C1-specific receptor (Gg-KIR2DSa) in gorilla.

Medical and surgical management of reproductive neoplasia in two western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Stringer, EM', 'De Voe, RS', 'Valea, F', 'Toma, S', 'Mulvaney, G', 'Pruitt, A', 'Troan, B', 'Loomis, MR']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1111/j.1600-0684.2010.00414.x,OCT 2010,2,"Background

Reports of female reproductive tract neoplasia are infrequent in great apes.

Methods

Two captive-born, female western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) housed at the North Carolina Zoological Park were diagnosed with reproductive neoplasia.

Results

The first gorilla had uterine endometrial thickening and uterine fibroids diagnosed during a routine annual examination. Subsequently, the animal underwent several uterine curettage procedures in an attempt to debulk the uterine mass. Biopsy results indicated uterine adenocarcinoma. The animal was treated with an ovariohysterectomy followed by a combination of megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate. The second gorilla was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina, cervix, and uterus after presenting for intermittent vaginal bleeding of 1-month duration. This animal underwent palliative radiation therapy, receiving two rounds of radiation treatment 8 weeks apart.

Conclusions

The following report describes the diagnosis and management of the two cases."
"Widespread Infection with Homologues of Human Parvoviruses B19, PARV4, and Human Bocavirus of Chimpanzees and Gorillas in the Wild","['Sharp, CP', 'LeBreton, M', 'Kantola, K', 'Nana, A', 'Diffo, JL', 'Djoko, CF', 'Tamoufe, U', 'Kiyang, JA', 'Babila, TG', 'Ngole, EM', 'Pybus, OG', 'Delwart, E', 'Delaporte, E', 'Peeters, M', 'Soderlund-Venermo, M', 'Hedman, K', 'Wolfe, ND', 'Simmonds, P']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.01304-10,OCT 2010,45,"Infections with human parvoviruses B19 and recently discovered human bocaviruses (HBoVs) are widespread, while PARV4 infections are transmitted parenterally and prevalent specifically in injecting drug users and hemophiliacs. To investigate the exposure and circulation of parvoviruses related to B19 virus, PARV4, and HBoV in nonhuman primates, plasma samples collected from 73 Cameroonian wild-caught chimpanzees and gorillas and 91 Old World monkey (OWM) species were screened for antibodies to recombinant B19 virus, PARV4, and HBoV VP2 antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moderate to high frequencies of seroreactivity to PARV4 (63% and 18% in chimpanzees and gorillas, respectively), HBoV (73% and 36%), and B19 virus (8% and 27%) were recorded for apes, while OWMs were uniformly negative (for PARV4 and B19 virus) or infrequently reactive (3% for HBoV). For genetic characterization, plasma samples and 54 fecal samples from chimpanzees and gorillas collected from Cameroonian forest floors were screened by PCR with primers conserved within Erythrovirus, Bocavirus, and PARV4 genera. Two plasma samples (chimpanzee and baboon) were positive for PARV4, while four fecal samples were positive for HBoV-like viruses. The chimpanzee PARV4 variant showed 18% and 15% nucleotide sequence divergence in NS and VP1/2, respectively, from human variants (9% and 7% amino acid, respectively), while the baboon variant was substantially more divergent, mirroring host phylogeny. Ape HBoV variants showed complex sequence relationships with human viruses, comprising separate divergent homologues of HBoV1 and the recombinant HBoV3 species in chimpanzees and a novel recombinant species in gorillas. This study provides the first evidence for widespread circulation of parvoviruses in primates and enables future investigations of their epidemiology, host specificity, and (co)evolutionary histories."

After a conflict such affiliations, termed 'quadratic', may serve to reduce tension. This particular kind of conflict management has been found in hamadryas baboons. Following the classical and well-established approach for studying post-conflict behaviour [post-conflict/matched control method (PC/MC)], we collected behavioural data on a group of geladas (Theropithecus gelada) in order to check for the presence of quadratic affiliations. A total of 192 PC/MC pairs were collected on both adults and immature individuals. We did not find any increase of affiliation levels between bystanders during PC compared with MC condition. The distribution of affinitive quadratic interactions was not affected by either kinship or relationship quality of bystanders. Moreover, comparison of yawning and self-scratching behaviours (two of the typical non-primate displacement activities under stressful situations) recorded during PCs and MCs did not show any variation in the two conditions. Probably, due to the male tolerance and social cohesiveness in geladas, witnessing a fight does not necessarily induce a sufficient increase of tension in bystanders to be reduced by quadratic affiliation."
The adaptive significance of unproductive alternative splicing in primates,"['Skandalis, A', 'Frampton, M', 'Seger, J', 'Richards, MH']",RNA-A PUBLICATION OF THE RNA SOCIETY,10.1261/rna.2127910,OCT 2010,12,"Alternative gene splicing is pervasive in metazoa, particularly in humans, where the majority of genes generate splice variant transcripts. Characterizing the biological significance of alternative transcripts is methodologically difficult since it is impractical to assess thousands of splice variants as to whether they actually encode proteins, whether these proteins are functional, or whether transcripts have a function independent of protein synthesis. Consequently, to elucidate the functional significance of splice variants and to investigate mechanisms underlying the fidelity of mRNA splicing, we used an indirect approach based on analyzing the evolutionary conservation of splice variants among species. Using DNA polymerase beta as an indicator locus, we cloned and characterized the types and frequencies of transcripts generated in primary cell lines of five primate species. Overall, we found that in addition to the canonical DNA polymerase b transcript, there were 25 alternative transcripts generated, most containing premature terminating codons. We used a statistical method borrowed from community ecology to show that there is significant diversity and little conservation in alternative splicing patterns among species, despite high sequence similarity in the underlying genomic (exonic) sequences. However, the frequency of alternative splicing at this locus correlates well with life history parameters such as the maximal longevity of each species, indicating that the alternative splicing of unproductive splice variants may have adaptive significance, even if the specific RNA transcripts themselves have no function. These results demonstrate the validity of the phylogenetic conservation approach in elucidating the biological significance of alternative splicing."
New insights into the origin of two new epiphytic Impatiens species (Balsaminaceae) from West Central Africa based on molecular phylogenetic analyses,"['Janssens, SB', 'Fischer, E', 'Stevart, T']",TAXON,NA,OCT 2010,9,"During recent fieldwork activities conducted in order to complete the publication of the Flora of Gabon, new material was collected of two previously unknown Impatiens species. Molecular phylogenetic analyses and a detailed comparative morphological study confirmed the status of the newly collected material. Impatiens wilksiana Stevart, S.B. Janssens & Eb. Fisch. is characterized by a dense racemose inflorescence, rather small flowers, yellow petals and red sepals, whereas I. issembei S.B. Janssens, Stevart & Eb. Fisch. has few-flowered racemose inflorescences and larger flowers, which are entirely vivid-red. The divergence of I. issembei and wilksiana is estimated at 0.96 Ma ago, an age that corresponds with a shift towards increasingly variable drier conditions situated between 1.2 and 0.8 Ma ago. During this period, the once continuous ancestral population of I. issembei and I. wilksiana was probably fragmented into two sister populations restricted to the forest refuges in the Massif du Chaillu and the Monts de Cristal. Allopatric speciation in association with such refuges may have played a role in the origin and diversification of the present day African Impatiens."

Here we develop a single-genome amplification strategy to identify and characterize Plasmodium spp. DNA sequences in faecal samples from wild-living apes. Among nearly 3,000 specimens collected from field sites throughout central Africa, we found Plasmodium infection in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), but not in eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei) or bonobos (Pan paniscus). Ape plasmodial infections were highly prevalent, widely distributed and almost always made up of mixed parasite species. Analysis of more than 1,100 mitochondrial, apicoplast and nuclear gene sequences from chimpanzees and gorillas revealed that 99% grouped within one of six host-specific lineages representing distinct Plasmodium species within the subgenus Laverania. One of these from western gorillas comprised parasites that were nearly identical to P. falciparum. In phylogenetic analyses of full-length mitochondrial sequences, human P. falciparum formed a monophyletic lineage within the gorilla parasite radiation. These findings indicate that P. falciparum is of gorilla origin and not of chimpanzee, bonobo or ancient human origin."
Censusing the mountain gorillas in the Virunga Volcanoes: complete sweep method versus monitoring,"['Gray, M', 'McNeilage, A', 'Fawcett, K', 'Robbins, MM', 'Ssebide, B', 'Mbula, D', 'Uwingeli, P']",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-2028.2009.01142.x,SEP 2010,5,"The mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) of the Virunga Volcanoes Range of Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo are one of the most endangered ape populations in the world. Following a dramatic decline during the 1960s, and relative stability in the 1970s, the population steadily increased during the 1980s. Due to political instability and war, a complete census had not been conducted since 1989. Here we compare the results of a complete census using the 'sweep method' conducted in 2003 with those from a monitoring program, to estimate the size and distribution of the gorilla population. A total of 360 gorillas were counted from census measurements and known habituated groups. Based on quantitative assessments of the census accuracy, we calculated that an additional 20 gorillas were not counted, leading to an estimated population of 380 individuals, and a 1.15% annual growth rate since 1989. The Ranger Based Monitoring programme yielded similar results. The encouraging results must be viewed with caution, however, because the growth was concentrated almost entirely in one section of the Virungas. Additionally, the distribution of gorilla groups was negatively correlated with the frequency of human disturbances, which highlights the need to continue strengthening conservation efforts.Resume

The distribution of gorillas was modelled using a Maximum Entropy algorithm. Biophysical predictor variables were trained with daily GPS locations of gorillas during 2006. Elevation, as a climate surrogate, was the best predictor (58%) of the occurrence of gorillas. The mid-altitudes (2500-3500 m a.s.l.) contained the bulk of the gorilla groups. Incoming solar radiation, as proxy for comfortable nesting sites, was the second best predictor (17%). Vegetation types, as foliage provider, (13%) and slope steepness for providing security (12%) were contributing predictors. The modelled and actual gorilla distributions were together overlaid with people's resource use in the park. Both people and gorillas were congregated in the areas identified as most suitable for gorillas. However, within these areas spatial segregation was found between human natural resource-users and gorillas. Therefore, the number of gorillas is likely to be limited by the human natural resource use within the park. A perimeter fence, the introduction of community-based natural resource management, and a buffer zone are discussed as short-, medium- and long-term mitigation measures.Resume

While home range overlap was positively correlated with female association patterns, preferred associations were found between females showing as little as 27% home range overlap, and some pairs showed avoidance despite 100% home range overlap. Furthermore, on average, both casual and preferred associations took place between females that were more closely biparentally related than expected by chance and this pattern varied depending upon whether or not pairs of females shared the same matriline.

Do apes know that they could be wrong?,"['Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-010-0317-x,SEP 2010,41,"When confronted with uncertain or incomplete information in decision-making situations, monkeys and apes opt for either escaping the situation or seeking additional information. These responses have been interpreted as evidence of metacognitive abilities. However, this interpretation has been challenged. On the one hand, studies using the information-seeking paradigm have been criticized because subjects may simply engage in a search for information routine (e.g., search until spot the reward) without any metacognitive involvement. On the other hand, studies using the escape response paradigm have been criticized because subjects may not recognize their own state of uncertainty but have learned to use the escape response in the presence of certain stimuli configurations that create uncertainty. The current study attempted to address these two criticisms by presenting great apes (seven gorillas, eight chimpanzees, four bonobos, seven orangutans) with a seeking information task whose basic procedure consisted of presenting two hollow tubes, baiting one of them and letting subjects choose. Conditions varied depending on whether subjects had visual access to the baiting, the cost associated with seeking information, the time interval between baiting and choosing, the food quality and the additional information offered regarding the food's location. Although subjects showed a high retrieval accuracy when they had witnessed the baiting, they were more likely to check inside the tube before choosing when high stakes were involved (Experiment 3) or after a longer period of time had elapsed between the baiting and the retrieval of the reward (Experiment 2). In contrast, providing subjects with indirect auditory information about the food's location or increasing the cost of checking reduced checking before choosing (Experiment 1). Taken together, these findings suggest that subjects knew that they could be wrong when choosing."
Genomic architecture of MHC-linked odorant receptor gene repertoires among 16 vertebrate species,"['Santos, PSC', 'Kellermann, T', 'Uchanska-Ziegler, B', 'Ziegler, A']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s00251-010-0468-6,SEP 2010,11,"The recent sequencing and assembly of the genomes of different organisms have shown that almost all vertebrates studied in detail so far have one or more clusters of genes encoding odorant receptors (OR) in close physical linkage to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). It has been postulated that MHC-linked OR genes could be involved in MHC-influenced mate choice, comprising both pre- as well as post-copulatory mechanisms. We have therefore carried out a systematic comparison of protein sequences of these receptors from the genomes of man, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, rhesus macaque, mouse, rat, dog, cat, cow, pig, horse, elephant, opossum, frog and zebra fish (amounting to a total of 559 protein sequences) in order to identify OR families exhibiting evolutionarily conserved MHC linkage. In addition, we compared the genomic structure of this region within these 16 species, accounting for presence or absence of OR gene families, gene order, transcriptional orientation and linkage to the MHC or framework genes. The results are presented in the form of gene maps and phylogenetic analyses that reveal largely concordant repertoires of gene families, at least among tetrapods, although each of the eight taxa studied (primates, rodents, ungulates, carnivores, proboscids, marsupials, amphibians and teleosts) exhibits a typical architecture of MHC (or MHC framework loci)-linked OR genes. Furthermore, the comparison of the genomic organization of this region has implications for phylogenetic relationships between closely related taxa, especially in disputed cases such as the evolutionary history of even- and odd-toed ungulates and carnivores. Finally, the largely conserved linkage between distinct OR genes and the MHC supports the concept that particular alleles within a given haplotype function in a concerted fashion during self-/non-self-discrimination processes in reproduction."

At the time of diagnosis, the animal exhibited symptoms and signs of CHF with minimal exertion (New York Heart Association class III). Over a 16-mo period, the severity of CHF progressed to class IV (resting signs and symptoms) despite angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, beta-blockers, and diuretics. Because of intractable CHF and a QRS duration that was markedly prolonged compared with the normal range for this species, a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device was implanted using implantation techniques based on human surgical procedures. Placement of the right ventricular, right atrial, and left ventricular leads and pulse generator were accomplished in 5.5 hr. Telemetry of the device postoperatively via wand or remote radio frequency has allowed for noninvasive programming and interrogation. The clinical improvement in CHF with this therapy was immediate and dramatic for this animal. Six months after CRT device implantation, the device leads became dislodged during an altercation with another gorilla, with the rapid development of CHF upon cessation of biventricular pacing. A second procedure to replace the leads returned the gorilla to his previous level of activity. in 2007, the pulse generator was electively replaced for battery depletion with a device capable of remote radiofrequency programming and interrogation. CRT implantation, although requiring specialized equipment and surgical skill, appears to be a viable option for treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy in gorillas."

We compared the likelihood of effective detachment after transmitter life of four harness materials (7-mm- and 9-mm-wide polyester ribbon tape and polyester-coated rubber elastic) and three fastening methods (polyester thread, cotton thread, and Gorilla Super Glue (TM)) using dummy transmitters exposed to the elements for >1.5 years. Both polyester ribbon and polyester-coated rubber elastic materials resulted in similar physical wear and remained intact for longer than a typical field seasonal, but fastening harnesses using Gorilla Super Glue T resulted in the earliest and most consistent harness failure. Polyester ribbon material and glue fastening resulted in the earliest failure; mean failure time for 7-mm- and 9-mm-wide polyester ribbon tape with glue fastening was 408 days +/- 30 SE, and 249 days +/- 29 SE, respectively. Failure times for both 7-mm- and 9-mm-wide polyester-coated rubber elastic and Gorilla Super Glue T fastening treatments were in excess of one year (438 days +/- 14 SE and 438 days +/- 13 SE, respectively). All harnesses with sewn thread fastening treatments lasted a minimum mean of 456 days, and in the case of both 7-mm-wide polyester ribbon and polyester-coated rubber elastic, neither treatment ever failed over the period of study. Results suggest that using Gorilla Super Glue (TM) as a fastener maximized the likelihood of eventual harness failure, whereas transmitters fastened via sewing showed minimal signs of wear and were unlikely to be shed by a bird during a period of time less than two years. Additional experimental studies are warranted to examine alternative harness material types, fastening methods, and harness styles to maximize the potential of successful radio transmitter shedding."

We have been using evolutionary comparisons to trace (i) the origin(s) of HIV-1 and (ii) the origin(s) of AIDS. The closest relatives of HIV-1 are simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting wild-living chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in west central Africa. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed the origins of HIV-1: chimpanzees were the original hosts of this clade of viruses; four lineages of HIV-1 have arisen by independent cross-species transmissions to humans and one or two of those transmissions may have been via gorillas. However, SIVs are primarily monkey viruses: more than 40 species of African monkeys are infected with their own, species-specific, SIV and in at least some host species, the infection seems non-pathogenic. Chimpanzees acquired from monkeys two distinct forms of SIVs that recombined to produce a virus with a unique genome structure. We have found that SIV infection causes CD4(+) T-cell depletion and increases mortality in wild chimpanzees, and so the origin of AIDS is more ancient than the origin of HIV-1. Tracing the genetic changes that occurred as monkey viruses adapted to infect first chimpanzees and then humans may provide insights into the causes of the pathogenicity of these viruses."
Differences in the Cognitive Skills of Bonobos and Chimpanzees,"['Herrmann, E', 'Hare, B', 'Call, J', 'Tomasello, M']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0012438,AUG 27 2010,45,"While bonobos and chimpanzees are both genetically and behaviorally very similar, they also differ in significant ways. Bonobos are more cautious and socially tolerant while chimpanzees are more dependent on extractive foraging, which requires tools. The similarities suggest the two species should be cognitively similar while the behavioral differences predict where the two species should differ cognitively. We compared both species on a wide range of cognitive problems testing their understanding of the physical and social world. Bonobos were more skilled at solving tasks related to theory of mind or an understanding of social causality, while chimpanzees were more skilled at tasks requiring the use of tools and an understanding of physical causality. These species differences support the role of ecological and socio-ecological pressures in shaping cognitive skills over relatively short periods of evolutionary time."

A three-dimensional geometric morphometric approach is used to examine how PAF shape changes along the thoracolumbar vertebral column of each taxon and how PAF shape varies across taxa at corresponding vertebral levels. The thoracolumbar transition in PAP shape differs between Papio and the hominoids, between Hylobates and the great apes, and to a lesser extent, among great apes. At the level of the first lumbar vertebra, the PAP shape of Papio is distinguished from that of hominoids. At the level of the second lumbar vertebra, there is variation to some extent among all taxa. These findings suggest that morphological and functional distinctions in primate vertebral anatomy may be more complex than suggested by a ""long-backed"" versus ""short-backed"" dichotomy.

We present a comparative genetic analysis of one of these subspecies, C. a. palliatus, in Kenya and Tanzania that assesses evolutionary relationships and patterns of mitochondrial genetic diversity in 103 individuals across its geographic range. Fecal samples from approximately 156 individuals were collected in four localities: (1) Diani Forest, Kenya; (2) Shimoni, Kenya; (3) Udzungwa Mountains National Park, Eastern Arc Mountains, Tanzania; and (4) Mount Rungwe, Southern Highlands, Tanzania. These samples represent at least six groups, with 5-15 samples from each. Comparative sequence analysis of a 1,795 base pair mtDNA fragment revealed 19 unique haplotypes in four populations. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that sampled Kenyan haplotypes are paraphyletic, with one Kenyan haplotype basal to all other sampled haplotypes. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) suggests high levels of genetic variation among populations (Phi(ST) 0.72, P < 0.001). Genetic data are concordant with a subspecies level differentiation between C. a. palliatus populations in Kenya and those in Central and southern Tanzania, as earlier suggested based on pelage differences. This study highlights the evolutionary distinctiveness of Kenyan populations of C. a. palliatus relative to Tanzanian populations. Although C. a. palliatus habitat in Tanzania is currently better protected than in Kenya, our results suggest Kenyan and Tanzanian populations should be considered distinct units, and the protection of C. a. palliatus habitat in Kenya, as well as habitat connectivity between Kenyan populations, should be prioritized for conservation and management.

Quantifying Mental Foramen Position in Extant Hominoids and Australopithecus: Implications for its Use in Studies of Human Evolution,"['Robinson, CA', 'Williams, FL']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.21171,AUG 2010,6,"The location of the mental foramen on the mandibular corpus has figured prominently in debates concerning the taxonomy of fossil hominins and Gorilla gorilla. In this study we quantify the antero/posterior (A/P) position of the mental foramen across great apes, modern humans and Australopithecus. Contrary to most qualitative assessments, we find significant differences between some extant hominoid species in mental foramen A/P position supporting its potential usefulness as a character for taxonomic and phylogenetic analyses of fossil hominoids. Gorilla gorilla, particularly the eastern subspecies, with a comparatively longer dental arcade and fossil and extant hominins with reduced canines and incisors tend to exhibit more anteriorly positioned mental foramina. Conversely, Pan troglodytes exhibits more posteriorly positioned mental foramina. Variation in this character among Gorilla gorilla subspecies supports recent taxonomic assessments that separate eastern and western populations. In all taxa other than Pan troglodytes the A/P position of the mental foramen is positively allometric with respect to dental arcade length. Thus, within each of these species, specimens with longer dental arcades tend to have more posteriorly positioned mental foramina. Those species with greater sexual dimorphism in canine size and dental arcade length (i.e., Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus) exhibit more extreme differences between smaller and larger individuals. Moreover, among great apes those individuals with greater anterior convergence of the dental arcade tend to exhibit more posteriorly positioned mental foramina. Dental arcade length, canine crown area and anterior convergence are all significantly associated with mental foramen A/P position, suggesting that these traits may influence taxonomic variation in the A/P position of the mental foramen.

"Ecotourism: the modern predator? Implications of gorilla tourism on local livelihoods in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda","['Laudati, A']",ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE,10.1068/d15708,AUG 2010,10,"The role of ecotourism as a means of influencing the path of local development or encouraging conservation activities is not unproblematic. Indeed, an increasing body of literature not only challenges the assumed benevolence of ecotourism but critically questions the role of ecotourism in contributing to the greater social and economic justice so often assumed under these programs. This paper seeks to contribute to this growing body of critical literature through an analysis of the impact of ecotourism on the everyday lives of rural villagers adjacent to Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, paying particular attention to the social forms of access to and control over the process through which decisions about ecotourism take place. Drawing on a year of ethnographic-based fieldwork, this paper focuses on how the commodification of Bwindi as a product of wilderness, a wild and unspoilt destination marketed to foreign visitors, promotes the external control of conservation spaces by international organizations that ultimately contribute to, rather than alleviate, poverty and dependency in local communities. Beyond providing just another case study, however, this analysis argues that the 'new' relations between people and parks created under ecotourism in Bwindi have in actuality created new forms of control and vulnerabilities."
Some other kind of being: Human nature and animal subjects in ape language research,"['Bishop, R']",FEMINISM & PSYCHOLOGY,10.1177/0959353510368119,AUG 2010,3,"When asked to describe herself, Koko the nonhuman primate replied in sign-language that she was indeed a 'fine animal gorilla'. One of several nonhuman primates that have been undergoing language training since the 1970s, Koko's ability to grasp the fundaments of human expression have caused both fascination and derision in popular and scientific cultures. Yet visions of the language-using ape have not been simply a phenomenon of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Early natural history and Enlightenment philosophy make curious reference to the possibility of communicating apes. So similar to the human and yet existing in the terrain of animality, it was believed by some that the ape held a latent capacity for perfectibility - for emerging out of the mute world of the animal into the terrain of the human. An historically liminal entity, the great ape has been cast in both scientific literature and popular culture in various ways as a 'pre-human', a species that may be capable of becoming, through a training in the civilized manners and language of the world, fully human. In this sense, striking similarities can be found between the representation of nonhuman primates in contemporary ape language projects and historical discourses linking human childhood with a state of animality."
"Detection and characterization of hepatitis B virus strains from wild-caught gorillas and chimpanzees in Cameroon, Central Africa","['Njouom, R', 'Mba, SAS', 'Nerrienet, E', 'Foupouapouognigni, Y', 'Rousset, D']",INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.meegid.2010.05.002,AUG 2010,7,"Previous epidemiological studies have reported a high prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in chimpanzees in Gabon and Congo, Central Africa. There is no data for this species from Cameroon. To date few cases of active HBV infection have been documented in gorillas and only one complete HBV sequence has been described from a wild-caught gorilla originating from Cameroon and housed in Germany. Since gorillas are apes found in Cameroon, we thus investigated the prevalence and genetic relationships of HBV infecting apes in this area. We subjected 185 wild-caught apes' plasmas, including 159 from chimpanzees and 26 from gorillas to ELISA screening for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). Subsequently, we detected HBV DNA, sequenced the whole HBV genome and performed phylogenetic analysis. Eleven (6.9%) chimpanzees and 3 (11.6%) gorillas plasma were found HBsAg positive, of which 8 and 3 were positive for HBV DNA, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the 3 new gorilla HBV sequences grouped together with the single available HBV sequence from gorilla. Evidence of recombination between HBV Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Pan troglodytes vellerosus was observed in two of the Cameroonian strains. Findings from our study show that HBV infection is endemic in wild-born gorillas and chimpanzees in Cameroon, and that there is evidence of recombination between HBV strains circulating in chimpanzees. We demonstrated the existence of gorillas' specific HBV strains distinct but related to those found in chimpanzees living in the same habitat in Cameroon, providing substantial evidence of species association of HBV in NHPs.

Comparative forefoot trabecular bone architecture in extant hominids,"['Griffin, NL', ""D'Aout, K"", 'Ryan, TM', 'Richmond, BG', 'Ketcham, RA', 'Postnov, A', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.06.006,AUG 2010,19,"The appearance of a forefoot push-off mechanism in the hominin lineage has been difficult to identify, partially because researchers disagree over the use of the external skeletal morphology to differentiate metatarsophalangeal joint functional differences in extant great apes and humans. In this study, we approach the problem by quantifying properties of internal bone architecture that may reflect different loading patterns in metatarsophalangeal joints in humans and great apes. High-resolution x-ray computed tomography data were collected for first and second metatarsal heads of Homo sapiens (n = 26), Pan paniscus (n = 17), Pan troglodytes (n = 19), Gorilla gorilla (n = 16), and Pongo pygmaeus (n = 20). Trabecular bone fabric structure was analyzed in three regions of each metatarsal head. While bone volume fraction did not significantly differentiate human and great ape trabecular bone structure, human metatarsal heads generally show significantly more anisotropic trabecular bone architectures, especially in the dorsal regions compared to the corresponding areas of the great ape metatarsal heads. The differences in anisotropy between humans and great apes support the hypothesis that trabecular architecture in the dorsal regions of the human metatarsals are indicative of a forefoot habitually used for propulsion during gait. This study provides a potential route for predicting forefoot function and gait in fossil hominins from metatarsal head trabecular bone architecture. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Identification and Characterization of a New Bocavirus Species in Gorillas,"['Kapoor, A', 'Mehta, N', 'Esper, F', 'Poljsak-Prijatelj, M', 'Quan, PL', 'Qaisar, N', 'Delwart, E', 'Lipkin, WI']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0011948,JUL 23 2010,48,"A novel parvovirus, provisionally named Gorilla Bocavirus species 1 (GBoV1), was identified in four stool samples from Western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) with acute enteritis. The complete genomic sequence of the new parvovirus revealed three open reading frames (ORFs) with an organization similar to that of known bocaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis using complete capsid and non structural (NS) gene sequence suggested that the new parvovirus is most closely related to human bocaviruses (HBoV). However, the NS ORF is more similar in length to the NS ORF found in canine minute virus and bovine parvovirus than in HBoV. Comparative genetic analysis using GBoV and HBoV genomes enabled characterization of unique splice donor and acceptor sites that appear to be highly conserved among all four HBoV species, and provided evidence for expression of two different NS proteins in all primate bocaviruses. GBoV is the first non-human primate bocavirus identified and provides new insights into the genetic diversity and evolution of this highly prevalent and recently discovered group of parvoviruses."
Nest Groups of Wild Bonobos at Wamba: Selection of Vegetation and Tree Species and Relationships between Nest Group Size and Party Size,"['Mulavwa, MN', 'Yangozene, K', 'Yamba-Yamba, M', 'Motema-Salo, B', 'Mwanza, NN', 'Furuichi, T']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20810,JUL 2010,16,"We examined the location of nest groups, spatial distribution of nests within a nest group, and attributes of individual nests of wild bonobos at Wamba, Democratic Republic of Congo. We also examined the seasonal factors influencing nesting behavior and compared the nest group size with the 1 hr party size during daytime. We defined a nest group to be a cluster of nests that were built in the same evening and found within 30 m from the other nearest nest. Examination of the largest gap within a nest group suggested that 30 m was an acceptable cutoff value. Monthly rainfall or fruit abundance did not significantly influence the monthly mean nest group size. Nests were built in the swamp forest for as many as 13% observation days, suggesting the need for reevaluation of the use of swamp forest by bonobos. The use of swamp forest was influenced not by seasonal rainfall or fruit abundance, but by the fruiting of specific species. Preferred tree species for building nests accounted for 19.8% of standing trees, which suggested that the selection of sleeping sites was not largely restricted by the distribution of specific species. The mean 1 hr party size was almost identical through the day and was similar to the mean nest group size. Parties of bonobos sometimes split into smaller nest groups, especially when feeding on non-preferred fruits during fruit scarcity. By contrast, when feeding on preferred fruits while ranging in large parties, they often aggregated to form even larger nest groups. When sleeping in small- or middle-sized nest groups, they tended to aggregate the next morning. These tendencies may reflect the gregarious nature of bonobos who prefer to range or sleep together as far as circumstances allow. Am. J. Primatol. 72:575-586, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Triadic and collaborative play by gorillas in social games with objects,"['Tanner, JE', 'Byrne, RW']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-009-0308-y,JUL 2010,16,"Interaction with others over objects has until recently been thought lacking in the social play of non-human great apes, in contrast to that of children; even now, only bonobos have been observed to engage in social play involving objects. Human children's triadic interactions with objects involve joint attention, showing and giving, communication that maintains interaction, and sharing of emotions and experiences. We question assertions that chimpanzees, and non-human great apes in general, lack the key characteristics of children's collaborative play. Here, we show that zoo gorillas play games that are both triadic and collaborative. These games were videotaped at the San Francisco Zoo in five different years and involved five different pairings of gorillas. The context was in most cases playfully competitive, involving objects such as balls, bags and leather pieces as foci of joint attention; the ostensible goal in most games was to gain or keep possession of a particular object. In some episodes, roles as possessor or pursuer of an object were exchanged many times; in others, one gorilla retained possession of an object but encouraged pursuit from a partner. Through gaze and gesture, gorillas invited others to: share interest in and attention to objects; share patterns of play; and re-engage after breaks in play. Sometimes, gorillas would assist others in their efforts to engage in collaborative play: older gorillas encouraged younger partners by 'self-handicapping' their own actions. Collaborative games may occur later in the ontogeny of gorillas than in humans, and depend on the challenges and artifacts available in a particular group's habitat."
A modified mark test for own-body recognition in pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina),"['Macellini, S', 'Ferrari, PF', 'Bonini, L', 'Fogassi, L', 'Paukner, A']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-010-0313-1,JUL 2010,7,"Classic mirror self-recognition mark tests involve familiarizing the subject with its mirror image, surreptitiously applying a mark on the subject's eyebrow, nose, or ear, and measuring self-directed behaviors toward the mark. For many non-human primate species, however, direct gaze at the face constitutes an aggressive and threatening signal. It is therefore possible that monkeys fail the mark test because they do not closely inspect their faces in a mirror and hence they have no expectations about their physical appearance. In the current study, we prevented two pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) from seeing their own faces in a mirror, and we adopted a modified version of the classic mark test in which monkeys were marked on the chest, a body region to which they normally have direct visual access but that in the current study was visible only via a mirror. Neither monkey tried to touch the mark on its chest, possibly due to a failure to understand the mirror as a reflective surface. To further the monkeys' understanding of the mirror image, we trained them to reach for food using the mirror as the only source of information. After both monkeys had learned mirror-mediated reaching, we replicated the mark test. In this latter phase of the study, only one monkey scratched the red dye on the chest once. The results are consistent with other findings suggesting that monkeys are not capable of passing a mark test and imply that face and body recognition rely on the same cognitive abilities."
Effective non-invasive genetic monitoring of multiple wild western gorilla groups,"['Arandjelovic, M', 'Head, J', 'Kuhl, H', 'Boesch, C', 'Robbins, MM', 'Maisels, F', 'Vigilant, L']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2010.04.030,JUL 2010,28,"Obtaining reliable population size or abundance estimates of endangered species is critical for their conservation and management. Genotyping non-invasively collected samples is an effective way to gain insights into the number and grouping patterns of rare or elusive animals. In this study we used genetic capture-recapture estimators to obtain a precise estimate of the size of a western gorilla population inhabiting an intensely sampled 101 km(2) area in Loango National Park, Gabon. Using 394 putative gorilla samples collected opportunistically over a 3 year period, we identified 83 unique genotypes. We used a rarefaction curve, Bayesian estimator and two maximum-likelihood methods to estimate that between 87 and 107 individuals used the study area between February 2005 and September 2007. The confidence interval surrounding the genetic estimate was smaller than that obtained using traditional ape survey methods. In addition, genetic analysis showed that gorilla and chimpanzee faeces were identified with 98% and 95% accuracy in the field, respectively. Patterns of co-occurrence of individual gorillas suggest that at least 11 gorilla social groups and five lone silverback males lived in the study area and that several individuals transferred between groups during the 3-year study period. When properly designed and implemented as part of a long-term biomonitoring program, genetic capture-recapture should prove an invaluable tool for evaluating, even on a large-scale, the population size and dynamics of apes and other elusive species.

Dental and phylogeographic patterns of variation in gorillas,"['Pilbrow, V', 'GRAUERS GORILLA']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.01.009,JUL 2010,6,"Gorilla patterns of variation have great relevance for studies of human evolution. In this study, molar morphometrics were used to evaluate patterns of geographic variation in gorillas. Dental specimens of 323 adult individuals, drawn from the current distribution of gorillas in equatorial Africa were divided into 14 populations. Discriminant analyses and Mahalanobis distances were used to study population structure.

Results reveal that: 1) the West and East African gorillas form distinct clusters, 2) the Cross River gorillas are well separated from the rest of the western populations, 3) gorillas from the Virunga mountains and the Bwindi Forest can be differentiated from the lowland gorillas of Utu and Mwenga-Fizi, 4) the Tshiaberimu gorillas are distinct from other eastern gorillas, and the Kahuzi-Biega gorillas are affiliated with them. These findings provide support for a species distinction between Gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei, with subspecies G. g. diehli, G. g. gorilla, G. b. graueri, G. b. beringei, and possibly, G. b. rex-pygmaeorum. Clear correspondence between dental and other patterns of taxonomic diversity demonstrates that dental data reveal underlying genetic patterns of differentiation.

Dental distances increased predictably with altitude but not with geographic distances, indicating that altitudinal segregation explains gorilla patterns of population divergence better than isolation-by-distance. The phylogeographic pattern of gorilla dental metric variation supports the idea that Plio-Pleistocene climatic fluctuations and local mountain building activity in Africa affected gorilla phylogeography. I propose that West Africa comprised the historic center of gorilla distribution and experienced drift-gene flow equilibrium, whereas Nigeria and East Africa were at the periphery, where climatic instability and altitudinal variation promoted drift and genetic differentiation. This understanding of gorilla population structure has implications for gorilla conservation, and for understanding the distribution of sympatric chimpanzees and Plio-Pleistocene hominins.

"Endocranial shape asymmetries in Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla assessed via skull based landmark analysis","['Balzeau, A', 'Gilissen, E']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.03.013,JUL 2010,16,"Brain shape asymmetries or petalias consist of the extension of one cerebral hemisphere beyond the other. A larger frontal or caudal projection is usually coupled with a larger lateral extent of the more projecting hemisphere relative to the other. The concurrence of these petalial components is characteristic of hominins. Studies aimed at quantifying petalial asymmetries in human and great ape endocasts rely on the definition of the midline of the endocranial surface. Studies of brain material show that, at least in humans, most of the medial surface of the left occipital lobe distorts along the midline and protrudes on to the right side, making it difficult for midline and corresponding left and right reference point identification. In order to accurately quantify and compare brain shape asymmetries in extant hominid species, we propose here a new protocol based on the objective definition of cranial landmarks. We describe and quantify for the first time in three dimensions the positions of frontal and occipital protrusions in large samples of Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla. This study confirms the existence of frontal and occipital petalias in African apes. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the 3D structure of these petalias reveals shared features, as well as features that are unique to the different great ape species. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Secondary transfer of adult mantled howlers (Alouatta palliata) on Hacienda La Pacifica, Costa Rica: 1975-2009","['Clarke, MR', 'Glander, KE']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-010-0195-5,JUL 2010,7,"Natal emigration by male and female mantled howlers (Alouatta palliata), and subsequent immigration into breeding groups, is well documented for the free-ranging population on Hacienda La Pacifica, Costa Rica, but secondary transfer was considered rare (Glander in Int J Primatol 3: 415-436, 1992). Population surveys in 1998 and 2006 caused us to question our assumptions and to re-evaluate our long-term data set from a post hoc perspective. We first identified all animals observed or captured as adults in more than one non-natal group anywhere in the population. We then systematically analyzed joining or leaving by adults in seven groups tracked for various times from 1975 to 2005 for patterns suggesting secondary transfer. Fourteen adults (nine females, five males) were found in two different non-natal groups as adults. In addition, one male and one female that became dominant and reproduced in their natal group later transferred to a second group, and one female was known to be a tertiary transfer. Data from the seven tracked social groups indicate that 35% of all the males and 29% of all the females were potential secondary transfers. In these groups, males leaving or joining was not associated with group size or absolute number of females. Females leaving or joining was not associated with group size or absolute number of males, but females left groups with more females and joined groups with fewer females. Both sexes left groups with unfavorable sex ratios for their sex and joined groups with sex ratios more favorable for their sex. Since a favorable sex ratio is associated with reproductive success in other howler populations, this suggests secondary transfer as a reproductive strategy. Other factors could also influence secondary transfer."

In this study, we examined handedness in 22 captive gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) across a range of behaviours that were part of their daily routine. Ten individuals showed no preferences for any of the behaviours performed, and the majority of the remaining individuals showed a preference for only one behaviour. These results lend support to the theory that species-level handedness is unique to humans. It is hoped that these results will contribute to investigations into the evolution of handedness, which can ultimately be used to further our understanding of the evolution of human language and cognition."

Two chimpanzee samples are P. falciparum. A third sample is P. reichenowi and two others are P. gaboni. The other chimpanzee samples are different from those in the ape clade: two are Plasmodium ovale, and one is Plasmodium malariae. That is, we have found three human Plasmodium parasites in chimpanzees. Four chimpanzee samples were mixed: one species was P. reichenowi; the other species was P. gaboni in three samples and P. ovale in the fourth sample. The lemur sample, provisionally named Plasmodium malagasi, is a sister lineage to the large cluster of primate parasites that does not include P. falciparum or ape parasites, suggesting that the falciparum + ape parasite cluster (Laverania clade) may have evolved from a parasite present in hosts not ancestral to the primates. If malignant malaria were eradicated from human populations, chimpanzees, in addition to gorillas, might serve as a reservoir for P. falciparum."

"Dental Wear, Wear Rate, and Dental Disease in the African Apes","['Elgart, AA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20797,JUN 2010,7,"The African apes possess thinner enamel than do other hominoids, and a certain amount of dentin exposure may be advantageous in the processing of tough diets eaten by Gorilla. Dental wear (attrition plus abrasion) that erodes the enamel exposes the underlying dentin and creates additional cutting edges at the dentin-enamel junction. Hypothetically, efficiency of food processing increases with junction formation until an optimal amount is reached, but excessive wear hinders efficient food processing and may lead to sickness, reduced fecundity, and death. Occlusal surfaces of molars and incisors in three populations each of Gorilla and Pan were videotaped and digitized. The quantity of incisal and molar occlusal dental wear and the lengths of dentin-enamel junctions were measured in 220 adult and 31 juvenile gorilla and chimpanzee skulls. Rates of dental wear were calculated in juveniles by scoring the degree of wear between adjacent molars M1 and M2. Differences were compared by principal (major) axis analysis. ANOVAs compared means of wear amounts. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to compare the relationship between molar wear and incidence of dental disease.

Results indicate that quantities of wear are significantly greater in permanent incisors and molars and juvenile molars of gorillas compared to chimpanzees. The lengths of dentin-enamel junctions were predominantly suboptimal. Western lowland gorillas have the highest quantities of wear and the most molars with suboptimal wear. The highest rates of wear are seen in Pan paniscus and Pan t. troglodytes, and the lowest rates are found in P.t. schweinfurthii and G. g. graueri. Among gorillas, G. b. beringei have the highest rates but low amounts of wear. Coefficients between wear and dental disease were low, but significant when all teeth were combined. Gorilla teeth are durable, and wear does not lead to mechanical senescence in this sample. Am. J. Primatol. 72:481-491, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Using Behavior to Determine Immature Life-Stages in Captive Western Gorillas,"['Hutchinson, JE', 'Fletcher, AW']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20799,JUN 2010,1,"Ontogenic development is divided into infant, juvenile, adolescent and adult life-stages. Although the developmental trajectory of an individual is a flexible entity, which differs within species, environment and sex, life-stage classifications are generally structured, age-based systems. This invariably leads to rigidity within a dynamic system and consequently hampers our understanding of primate life history strategies. We propose that life-stage classifications should be quantitative, flexible entities, which use a reliable measurement of development. Here, we provide a methodological example where placement into a life-stage is based upon behavioral variance between other similar-aged individuals. Behavioral data were collected from 12 male (3-11 years old) and 9 female (3-8 years old) captive immature western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) housed in five family groups, using continuous focal sampling; 900 hr of data were collected over 131 days. Data were applied to four published life-stage classifications for mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), which showed variable ability to determine life-stage in western gorillas. A new life-stage classification (Hutchinson & Fletcher) was proposed specifically for western gorillas, whereby multiple co-varying behavior provided a robust measure of linear development across immaturity. Each life-stage was found to be a distinct ontogenic phase and the classification discriminated life-stage with a high level of accuracy. Using the Hutchinson & Fletcher classification we provide evidence for disparity in developmental trajectories between the sexes from the juvenile period onwards. To expand the understanding of primate life histories, we propose that flexible classifications should be used to enable comparison of allometric life history traits within and between species, from birth onwards.

"The use of human-given cues by domestic horses, Equus caballus, during an object choice task","['Proops, L', 'Walton, M', 'McComb, K']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.02.015,JUN 2010,21,"Selection pressures during domestication are thought to lead to an enhanced ability to use human-given cues. Horses fulfil a wide variety of roles for humans and have been domesticated for at least 5000 years but their ability to read human cues has not been widely studied. We tested the ability of 28 horses to attend to human-given cues in an object choice task. We included five different cues: distal sustained pointing, momentary tapping, marker placement, body orientation and gaze ( head) alternation. Horses were able to use the pointing and marker placement cues spontaneously but not the tapping, body orientation and gaze alternation cues. The overall pattern of responding suggests that horses may use cues that provide stimulus enhancement at the time of choice and do not have an understanding of the communicative nature of the cues given. As such, their proficiency at this task appears to be inferior to that of domestic dogs, Canis lupus familiaris, but similar to that of domestic goats, Caprus hircus.

The von Economo neurons in frontoinsular and anterior cingulate cortex in great apes and humans,"['Allman, JM', 'Tetreault, NA', 'Hakeem, AY', 'Manaye, KF', 'Semendeferi, K', 'Erwin, JM', 'Park, S', 'Goubert, V', 'Hof, PR']",BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION,10.1007/s00429-010-0254-0,JUN 2010,107,"The von Economo neurons (VENs) are large bipolar neurons located in frontoinsular (FI) and anterior cingulate cortex in great apes and humans, but not other primates. We performed stereological counts of the VENs in FI and LA (limbic anterior, a component of anterior cingulate cortex) in great apes and in humans. The VENs are more numerous in humans than in apes, although one gorilla approached the lower end of the human range. We also examined the ontological development of the VENs in FI and LA in humans. The VENs first appear in small numbers in the 36th week post-conception, are rare at birth, and increase in number during the first 8 months after birth. There are significantly more VENs in the right hemisphere than in the left in FI and LA in postnatal brains of apes and humans. This asymmetry in VEN numbers may be related to asymmetries in the autonomic nervous system. The activity of the inferior anterior insula, which contains FI, is related to physiological changes in the body, decision-making, error recognition, and awareness. The VENs appear to be projection neurons, although their targets are unknown. We made a preliminary study of the connections of FI cortex based on diffusion tensor imaging in the brain of a gorilla. The VEN-containing regions connect to the frontal pole as well as to other parts of frontal and insular cortex, the septum, and the amygdala. It is likely that the VENs in FI are projecting to some or all of these structures and relaying information related to autonomic control, decision-making, or awareness. The VENs selectively express the bombesin peptides neuromedin B (NMB) and gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) which are also expressed in another population of closely related neurons, the fork cells. NMB and GRP signal satiety. The genes for NMB and GRP are expressed selectively in small populations of neurons in the insular cortex in mice. These populations may be related to the VEN and fork cells and may be involved in the regulation of appetite. The loss of these cells may be related to the loss of satiety signaling in patients with frontotemporal dementia who have damage to FI. The VENs and fork cells may be morphological specializations of an ancient population of neurons involved in the control of appetite present in the insular cortex in all mammals. We found that the protein encoded by the gene DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia) is preferentially expressed by the VENs. DISC1 has undergone rapid evolutionary change in the line leading to humans, and since it suppresses dendritic branching it may be involved in the distinctive VEN morphology."
Yank's Tragedy from the Perspective of Ecological Ethics,"['Hui, L']",FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES,NA,JUN 2010,0,"This essay, combining ethical literary criticism and eco-criticism organically, tries to reinterpret Yank's tragedy. It holds that the central images of ""the hairy ape"" and ""the cage"" are subtly symbolic, which present a vivid depiction of human eco-ethical scenes in industrial civilization in terms of the three ethical dimensions: man and nature, man and society, and man and himself. The image of ""Yank shaking hands with the gorilla"", which serves as the symbol of the reestablishment of the relationship between man and nature, fully reflects the ethical claim of O' Neill-the harmony between man and nature. Based on an in-depth analysis of the three images, the essay concludes by pointing out that Yank's life is an ethical tragedy upon which his ethical consciousness works. While Yank is pursuing his ethical identity, he steps into his ethical dilemma that finally ruins him. Yank's tragedy can be avoided."

Chimpanzees occur in 3 of the 5 protected areas in Guinea but their conservation status is unknown. We conducted a chimpanzee census in 2001-2002 in the Haut Niger National Park (HNNP), the largest protected area in the country. We counted nests along a total of 103.83 km of transects in the Mafou forest, 1 of the 2 core areas of the park. We recorded a total of 823 nests, of which 38.1% were located in gallery forests, although this habitat type covers only 4.2% of the study site. Using a site-specific mean nest decay rate of 194 days, we estimated the mean density of chimpanzees in the study area at 0.87 weaned individuals/kmA(2), the highest density recorded in any West African protected area. A survey conducted in 2008-2009 by other authors in the Mafou forest suggests that the chimpanzee population remained stable over the last 6 yr. Given the significance of the chimpanzee population of the HNNP at the national and international levels, we provide recommendations for its conservation over the long term. Our results highlight the importance of gallery forests as key habitat for chimpanzees in the savannah biome. We therefore recommend that more attention be paid to the conservation of this habitat in land management and conservation planning schemes. In particular, we recommend setting aside gallery forests as ecological corridors between nearby protected areas to maintain exchange between distant chimpanzee populations."

This is the oldest population of hominins known outside of Africa. Understanding the set of anatomical and behavioral traits that equipped this population to exploit their seasonal habitat successfully may shed light on the selection pressures shaping early members of the genus Homo and the ecological strategies that permitted the expansion of their range outside of the African subtropics. The abundant stone tools at the site, as well as taphonomic evidence for butchery, suggest that the Dmanisi hominins were active hunters or scavengers. In this study, we examine the locomotor mechanics of the Dmanisi hind limb to test the hypothesis that the inclusion of meat in the diet is associated with an increase in walking and running economy and endurance. Using comparative data from modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, as well as other fossil hominins, we show that the Dmanisi hind limb was functionally similar to modern humans, with a longitudinal plantar arch, increased limb length, and human-like ankle morphology. Other aspects of the foot, specifically metatarsal morphology and tibial torsion, are less derived and similar to earlier hominins. These results are consistent with hypotheses linking hunting and scavenging to improved walking and running performance in early Homo. Primitive retentions in the Dmanisi foot suggest that locomotor evolution continued through the early Pleistocene. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
NONINVASIVE SALIVA COLLECTION TECHNIQUES FOR FREE-RANGING MOUNTAIN GORILLAS AND CAPTIVE EASTERN GORILLAS,"['Smiley, T', 'Spelman, L', 'Lukasik-Braum, M', 'Mukherjee, J', 'Kaufman, G', 'Akiyoshi, DE', 'Cranfield, M']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/2009-0015R.1,JUN 2010,8,"This study was designed to develop a simple, noninvasive method for saliva collection: a first step toward developing new diagnostic tests to survey gorillas for infectious diseases. The subjects included free-ranging mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in the Pare National des Volcans, Rwanda, and a group of orphan mountain and Grauer's gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri) housed nearby in a temporary holding facility. Three collection methods were used to recover saliva from discarded forest food: swabbing, soaking, and washing. Saliva was also collected from orphan gorillas maintained in a captive setting by using dental ropes inside mesh bags. The presence of gorilla saliva in each sample was confirmed by using a salivary alpha-amylase assay and forensic press test paper. The recovery of gorilla DNA was verified by polymerase chain reaction by using primers specific to mountain and Grauer's gorillas. Of the three collection techniques used to recover saliva from forest food, directly swabbing plant bite marks was the most effective. Wild celery (Peucedanum linderi) provided for the most consistent saliva recovery and is eaten year round by mountain gorillas in Rwanda. This study shows that gorilla saliva can be recovered easily and noninvasively from known individual free-ranging gorillas by collecting pieces of wild celery discarded as the gorillas forage and from captive gorillas by offering them juice-soaked dental ropes inside mesh bags. Both methods can be used to recover gorilla DNA for genetic studies. Saliva collected from free-ranging and captive gorillas may prove to be a useful biologic sample for the development of new diagnostic tests and hormonal analysis."
VALIDATION OF MULTIPLE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES TO DETECT CRYPTOSPORIDIUM SP AND GIARDIA SP IN FREE-RANGING WESTERN LOWLAND GORILLAS (GORILLA GORILLA GORILLA) AND OBSERVATIONS ON THE PREVALENCE OF THESE PROTOZOAN INFECTIONS IN TWO POPULATIONS IN GABON,"['Langhout, MV', 'Reed, P', 'Fox, M']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/2009-0051R1.1,JUN 2010,2,"Anthropozoonotic diseases threaten the survival of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Use of accurate diagnostic techniques in gorilla health monitoring contributes to the conservation of gorillas by providing robust information for appropriate management decisions. To identify suitable protozoa diagnostic techniques for wild gorillas, 95 fecal specimens were collected in Lope National Park and east of Moukalaba-Doudou National Park in Gabon, areas with high and low levels of human activity, respectively. The samples were examined for Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia sp. by using the following diagnostic techniques: a commercially available immunofluorescent antibody test kit, Merifluor, and a rapid immune-assay, ImmunoCard STAT!, to detect Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia sp., and a modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain to detect Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts. The results obtained from the Merifluor test, considered the ""gold standard"" in human studies, were used to estimate the prevalence of Cryptosporidium) sp. and Giardia sp. infections in Lope National Park (19.0% and 22.6%, respectively) and east of Moukalaba-Doudou National Park (0% and 9.1%, respectively). The difference in prevalence in both areas may be associated with differing levels of anthropogenic disturbance. The sensitivity and specificity of the latter two diagnostic techniques were calculated by using the Merifluor test as a control. The ImmunoCard STAT! was found suitable for Giardia sp. antigen detection (specific but not sensitive) and inappropriate for Cryptosporidium sp. antigen detection (not specific or sensitive). The modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain was found to be highly specific but not sensitive in the detection of Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts. These results underline the necessity of using ancillary tests and concentration methods to correctly identify positive samples. This is the first report of Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia sp. infections in free-ranging western lowland gorillas and highlights the importance of verifying the accuracy of diagnostic techniques developed for human use before applying these to non-human primates."
DIENTAMOEBA FRAGILIS: INITIAL EVIDENCE OF PATHOGENICITY IN THE WESTERN LOWLAND GORILLA (GORILLA GORILLA GORILLA),"['Lankester, F', 'Kiyang, JA', 'Bailey, W', 'Unwin, S']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/2009-0190.1,JUN 2010,6,"A 7-yr-old female western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) shared an enclosure with 10 other gorillas at the Limbe Wildlife Centre (LWC), a wildlife rehabilitation centre in Cameroon.

Evidence for Emulation in Chimpanzees in Social Settings Using the Floating Peanut Task,"['Tennie, C', 'Call, J', 'Tomasello, M']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0010544,MAY 12 2010,28,"Background: It is still unclear which observational learning mechanisms underlie the transmission of difficult problem-solving skills in chimpanzees. In particular, two different mechanisms have been proposed: imitation and emulation. Previous studies have largely failed to control for social factors when these mechanisms were targeted.

Methods: In an attempt to resolve the existing discrepancies, we adopted the 'floating peanut task', in which subjects need to spit water into a tube until it is sufficiently full for floating peanuts to be grasped. In a previous study only a few chimpanzees were able to invent the necessary solution (and they either did so in their first trials or never). Here we compared success levels in baseline tests with two experimental conditions that followed: 1) A full model condition to test whether social demonstrations would be effective, and 2) A social emulation control condition, in which a human experimenter poured water from a bottle into the tube, to test whether results information alone (present in both experimental conditions) would also induce successes. Crucially, we controlled for social factors in both experimental conditions. Both types of demonstrations significantly increased successful spitting, with no differences between demonstration types. We also found that younger subjects were more likely to succeed than older ones. Our analysis showed that mere order effects could not explain our results.

Conclusion: The full demonstration condition (which potentially offers additional information to observers, in the form of actions), induced no more successes than the emulation condition. Hence, emulation learning could explain the success in both conditions. This finding has broad implications for the interpretation of chimpanzee traditions, for which emulation learning may perhaps suffice."

We studied entodimomorphid ciliates in 23 captive groups of chimpanzees, three groups of captive bonobos and six populations of wild chimpanzees. Fecal samples were examined using Sheather's flotation and Merthiolate-Iodme-Formaldehyde Concentration (MIFC) methods. We quantified the number of ciliates per gram of feces The MIFC method was more sensitive for ciliate detection than the flotation method Ciliates of genus Troglodytella were detected in 13 groups of captive chimpanzees, two groups of bonobos and in all wild chimpanzee populations studied The absence of entodiniomorphids in some captive groups might be because of the extensive administration of chemotherapeutics in the past or a side-effect of the causative or prophylactic administration of antiparasitic or antibiotic drugs. The infection intensities of ciliates in captive chimpanzees were higher than in wild ones. We suppose that the over-supply of starch, typical in captive primate diets, might induce an increase in the number of ciliates In vitro studies on metabolism and biochemical activities of entodiniomorphids are needed to clarify their role in ape digestion.

We conducted three experiments with great apes to investigate strategy preferences and factors that may shape them. In the first experiment, we trained 17 apes to remember 12 different food locations on the floor of their sleeping room. The 12 food locations were associated with one feature cue, so that feature and spatial cues were confounded. In a single test session, we brought the cues into conflict and found that apes, irrespective of species, showed a preference for a feature strategy. In the second experiment, we used a similar procedure and trained 25 apes to remember one food location on a platform in front of them. On average, apes preferred to use a feature strategy but some individuals relied on a spatial strategy. In the final experiment, we investigated whether training might influence strategy preferences. We tested 21 apes in the platform set-up and found that apes used both, feature and spatial strategies irrespective of training. We conclude that apes can use feature and spatial strategies to remember the location of hidden food items, but that task demands (e.g. different numbers of search locations) can influence strategy preferences. We found no evidence, however, for the role of training in shaping these preferences."

However, often these objects become hidden. To later locate such objects, the organism must maintain a representation of the object in memory and generate an expectation about where it will later appear. We explored adult dogs' knowledge and use of the solidity principle (that one solid object cannot pass through another solid object) by evaluating search behavior. Subjects watched as a treat rolled down an inclined tube into a box. The box either did or did not contain a solid wall dividing it in half. To find the treat, subjects had to modify their search behavior based on the presence or absence of the wall, which either did or did not block the treat's trajectory. Dogs correctly searched the near location when the barrier was present and the far location when the barrier was absent. They displayed this behavior from the first trial, as well as performed correctly when trial types were intermingled. These results suggest that dogs direct their searches in accordance with the solidity principle."
Individually Identifiable Body Odors Are Produced by the Gorilla and Discriminated by Humans,"['Hepper, PG', 'Wells, DL']",CHEMICAL SENSES,10.1093/chemse/bjq015,MAY 2010,6,"Many species produce odor cues that enable them to be identified individually, as well as providing other socially relevant information. Study of the role of odor cues in the social behavior of great apes is noticeable by its absence. Olfaction has been viewed as having little role in guiding behavior in these species. This study examined whether Western lowland gorillas produce an individually identifiable odor. Odor samples were obtained by placing cloths in the gorilla's den. A delayed matching to sample task was used with human participants (n = 100) to see if they were able to correctly match a target odor sample to a choice of either: 2 odors (the target sample and another, Experiment 1) and 6 odors (the target sample and 5 others, Experiment 2). Participants were correctly able to identify the target odor when given either 2 or 6 matches. Subjects made fewest errors when matching the odor of the silverback, whereas matching the odors of the young gorillas produced most errors. The results indicate that gorillas do produce individually identifiable body odors and introduce the possibility that odor cues may play a role in gorilla social behavior."

It has been suggested that OH 8 may represent the foot of a subadult and may be associated with the OH 7 mandible, the type specimen of Homo habilis. This assertion is based on the presence of what may be unfused distal metatarsal epiphyses. Accurately assessing the skeletal maturity of the OH 8 foot is important for interpretations of the functional morphology and locomotor behavior of Plio-Pleistocene hominins. In this study, we compare metatarsal fusion patterns and internal bone morphology of the lateral metatarsals among subadult hominines (85 modern humans, 48 Pan, and 25 Gorilla) to assess the likelihood that OH 8 belonged to either an adult or subadult hominin. Our results suggest that if OH 8 is indeed from a subadult, then it displays a metatarsal developmental pattern that is unobserved in our comparative sample. In OH 8, the fully fused base of the first metatarsal and the presence of trabecular bone at the distal ends of the second and third metatarsal shafts make it highly improbable that it belonged to a subadult, let alone a subadult that matches the developmental age of the OH 7 mandible. In total, the results of this study suggest that the OH 8 foot most likely belonged to an adult hominin. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Morphological integration and the evolution of knuckle-walking,"['Williams, SA', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFRICANUS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.03.005,MAY 2010,8,"The evolution of knuckle-walking has profound implications for our understanding of the emergence of bipedalism. The modern debate surrounding its evolution is concerned with whether or not it is homologous in chimpanzees and gorillas. Here, this problem is approached using the methods of morphological integration to test hypotheses of patterns and magnitudes of integration in the third manual ray and capitate. If knuckle-walking morphologies are highly integrated and evolve in a correlated bundle (i.e., comprising a functional complex), it seems reasonable that they could have been recruited independently relatively easily in gorillas and chimpanzees, thus increasing the likelihood of homoplasy. If, however, there is no evidence for a knuckle-walking complex, then it seems less likely that chimpanzees and gorillas would have evolved knuckle-walking independently. Results indicate that chimpanzees and gorillas are not characterized by high magnitudes of integration or unique patterns of integration that distinguish them from non-knuckle-walking taxa. This does not support the hypothesis of a knuckle-walking complex, nor does it support the contention that knuckle-walking could have been easily evolved independently in chimpanzees and gorillas. Implications for trait analysis and the evolution of bipedalism are discussed, as are recent analyses supporting the independent origins of knuckle-walking. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Unhealthy travelers present challenges to sustainable primate ecotourism,"['Muehlenbein, MP', 'Martinez, LA', 'Lemke, AA', 'Ambu, L', 'Nathan, S', 'Alsisto, S', 'Sakong, R']",TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE,10.1016/j.tmaid.2010.03.004,MAY 2010,11,"Background: Ecotourism can function as a powerful tool for species conservation. However, a significant proportion of travelers at wildlife sanctuaries may be ill and potentially infectious, creating unnecessary risk of pathogen transmission to wildlife.

Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to adult visitors at the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre, Sabah, Malaysia. The questionnaire recorded age, occupation, region of origin, history of recent travel, recent contact with livestock, domestic and wild animals, and diagnoses/symptoms of various infections.

Results: 15% of the 633 tourists self-reported at least one of the following current symptoms: cough, sore throat, congestion, fever, diarrhea and vomiting. Participants who reported recent animal contact were significantly more likely to report current respiratory symptoms compared to other participants. Likewise, participants with a medical-related occupation were more likely to report current respiratory symptoms while at Sepilok compared to other participants.

Conclusions: Despite being ill and potentially infectious, these tourists were visiting a wildlife sanctuary to view endangered species. Many of these visitors had animal contact immediately prior to arriving, and many had at least some basic knowledge about infection transmission. While participants in nature-based tourism are generally concerned about environmental protection, present analyses suggest that a significant proportion of ecotourists are uninformed of the risks they may pose to non-human animal health.

Monitoring Great Ape and Elephant Abundance at Large Spatial Scales: Measuring Effectiveness of a Conservation Landscape,"['Stokes, EJ', 'Strindberg, S', 'Bakabana, PC', 'Elkan, PW', 'Iyenguet, FC', 'Madzoke, B', 'Malanda, GAF', 'Mowawa, BS', 'Moukoumbou, C', 'Ouakabadio, FK', 'Rainey, HJ']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0010294,APR 23 2010,41,"Protected areas are fundamental to biodiversity conservation, but there is growing recognition of the need to extend beyond protected areas to meet the ecological requirements of species at larger scales. Landscape-scale conservation requires an evaluation of management impact on biodiversity under different land-use strategies; this is challenging and there exist few empirical studies. In a conservation landscape in northern Republic of Congo we demonstrate the application of a large-scale monitoring program designed to evaluate the impact of conservation interventions on three globally threatened species: western gorillas, chimpanzees and forest elephants, under three land-use types: integral protection, commercial logging, and community-based natural resource management. We applied distance-sampling methods to examine species abundance across different land-use types under varying degrees of management and human disturbance. We found no clear trends in abundance between land-use types. However, units with interventions designed to reduce poaching and protect habitats irrespective of land-use type - harboured all three species at consistently higher abundance than a neighbouring logging concession undergoing no wildlife management. We applied Generalized-Additive Models to evaluate a priori predictions of species response to different landscape processes. Our results indicate that, given adequate protection from poaching, elephants and gorillas can profit from herbaceous vegetation in recently logged forests and maintain access to ecologically important resources located outside of protected areas. However, proximity to the single integrally protected area in the landscape maintained an overriding positive influence on elephant abundance, and logging roads - even subject to anti-poaching controls - were exploited by elephant poachers and had a major negative influence on elephant distribution. Chimpanzees show a clear preference for unlogged or more mature forests and human disturbance had a negative influence on chimpanzee abundance, in spite of anti-poaching interventions. We caution against the pitfalls of missing and confounded co-variables in model-based estimation approaches and highlight the importance of spatial scale in the response of different species to landscape processes. We stress the importance of a stratified design-based approach to monitoring species status in response to conservation interventions and advocate a holistic framework for landscape-scale monitoring that includes smaller-scale targeted research and punctual assessment of threats."

"Are the Gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park ""True"" Mountain Gorillas?","['Elgart, AA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21172,APR 2010,2,"The gorillas that inhabit Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda are the least known of the eastern gorillas. Because they are an allopatric population living a minimum of 25 km from the well-studied population of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in Rwanda and have certain morphological and ecological differences from these gorillas, their taxonomic status has been in question in recent years. This study presents new craniodental metrics from Bwindi individuals and compares them to Virunga individuals as well as to eastern lowland gorillas, G. gorilla graueri. Multivariate statistics, including MAN-COVA, least-squares, regression, and principal components analyses, were used to evaluate how closely the Bwindi crania resemble the Virunga crania and how both relate to G. g. graueri. Results indicate that the Bwindi gorillas have generally smaller crania than the Virunga gorillas, but when metrics are log-transformed, the only variable that distinguishes the Bwindi individuals is a longer face. When both populations are compared to G. g. graueri, they cluster together separately from the eastern lowland gorillas, sharing such features as higher rami, wider bigonia, longer mandibles, and wider and shorter mandibular symphyses in relation to G. g. graueri. Functional morphological explanations for these differences are discussed, but lacking measurements of the physical properties of G. g. graueri, they cannot fully be explained. Results clearly indicate that at least pertaining to the cranium, upon which most gorilla taxonomy is based, the Bwindi gorillas are proper mountain gorillas (G. b. beringei).

Oval in Males and Triangular in Females? A Quantitative Evaluation of Sexual Dimorphism in the Human Obturator Foramen,"['Bierry, G', 'Le Minor, JM', 'Schmittbuhl, M']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21227,APR 2010,4,"Among the numerous pelvic traits presenting sex differences, the obturator foramen is classically described as being oval in males and triangular in females. However, no demonstrations or detailed studies seem available in the literature. The purpose of this work was to study quantitatively this trait using Fourier analysis, because this methodological approach is particularly well adapted for discrimination between different simple shapes. Using this approach, an outline can be characterized by a series of harmonics (1 to n), each defined by two Fourier descriptors: amplitude (C(n)), describing the relative importance of the harmonic contribution to the original shape, and phase (Phi(n)), representing the orientation of the harmonic contribution. The material consisted of 104 three-dimensional CT reconstructions of adult pelves (52 males and 52 females). After size normalization, the outlines of the 104 left obturator foramens were studied. Significant differences were demonstrated with, in total, 84.6% of individuals presenting a correct inferred sex. The most discriminating descriptors were the phase of the second harmonic (C(2)), related to the oval (or elliptic) aspect and thus the elongation of the shape, and the amplitude of the third harmonic (Phi(3)), describing the triangularity of the shape. Because the trend for an outline to be more or less oval or triangular is difficult to visually assess and because there is an infinite number of transitional shapes, only a precise quantitative approach such as Fourier analysis allows for unambiguous characterization and statistical analysis.

Brief Communication: Captive Gorillas Are Right-Handed for Bimanual Feeding,"['Meguerditchian, A', 'Calcutt, SE', 'Lonsdorf, EV', 'Ross, SR', 'Hopkins, WD']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21244,APR 2010,30,"Predominance of right-handedness has historically been considered as a hallmark of human evolution. Whether nonhuman primates exhibit population-level manual bias remains a controversial topic. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that bimanual coordinated activities may be a key-behavior in our ancestors for the emergence and evolution of human population-level right-handedness. To this end, we collected data on hand preferences in 35 captive gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) during simple unimanual reaching and for bimanual coordinated feeding. Unimanual reaching consisted of grasping food on the ground, while bimanual feeding consisted of using one hand for holding a food and processing the food item by the opposite hand. No population-level manual bias was found for unimanual actions but, in contrast, gorillas exhibited a significant population-level right-handedness for the bimanual actions. Moreover, the degree of right-handedness for bimanual feeding exceeds any other known reports of hand use in primates, suggesting that lateralization for bimanual feeding is robust in captive gorillas. The collective evidence is discussed in the context of potential continuity of handedness between human and nonhuman primates. Am J Phys Anthropol 141:638-645, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Species introductions potentially incur such risks, yet little is currently known about the parasite fauna of introduced primate species over the long term. We describe the results of long-term monitoring of the intestinal parasite fauna of an unprovisioned, reproducing population of chimpanzees introduced 40 years earlier (1966-1969) onto Rubondo Island in Lake Victoria, Tanzania, a non-native habitat for chimpanzees. Two parasitological surveys (March 1997 October 1998 and October 2002 December 2005) identified Entamoeba spp. including E. coli, Iodamoeba buetschlii, Troglodytella abrassarti, Chilomastix mesnili, Trichuris sp., Anatrichosoma sp., Strongyloides spp., Strongylida fam. gen. sp., Enterobius anthropopitheci, Subulura sp., Ascarididae gen. sp., and Protospirura muricola. The parasite fauna of the Rubondo chimpanzees is similar to wild chimpanzees living in their natural habitats, but Rubondo chimpanzees have a lower prevalence of strongylids (9%, 3.8%) and a higher prevalence of E. anthropopitheci (8.6%, 17.9%) than reported elsewhere. Species prevalence was similar between our two surveys, with the exception of Strongyloides spp. being higher in the first survey. None of these species are considered to pose a serious health risk to chimpanzees, but continued monitoring of the population and surveys of the parasitic fauna of the two coinhabitant primate species and other animals, natural reservoir hosts of some of the same parasites, is important to better understand the dynamics of host parasite ecology and potential long-term implications for chimpanzees introduced into a new habitat.

Great Apes Track Hidden Objects After Changes in the Objects' Position and in Subject's Orientation,"['Albiach-Serrano, A', 'Call, J', 'Barth, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20790,APR 2010,15,"Eight chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), five bonobos (Pan paniscus), five gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), and seven orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) were presented with two invisible object displacement tasks. In full view of the subject, a food item was hidden under one of three opaque cups resting on a platform and, after an experimental manipulation, the subject was allowed to select one of the cups. In the rotation task, the platform was rotated 1800 while the subject remained stationary. In the translocation task, the platform remained stationary while the subject walked to the opposite side from where she saw the reward being hidden. The final position of the food relative to the subject was equivalent in both tasks. Single displacement trials consisted of only one manipulation, either a rotation or a translocation, whereas double displacement trials consisted of both a rotation and a translocation. We also included no displacement trials in which no displacements took place. No displacement trials were easier than single displacements which, in turn, were easier than double displacements. Unlike earlier studies with children, there was no difference in performance between rotation and translocation displacements. Overall, apes performed above chance in all conditions, but chimpanzees outperformed the other species. This study reinforces the notion that the great apes use an allocentric spatial coding. Am. J.

Understanding sources of shape variation in these surfaces is critical to correctly inferring the link between form and function. This study tests the hypothesis that increases in body size within a species result in flatter joint contours of the joint articular surface. Joint flattening is expected to regulate the magnitude and direction of transarticular stresses passing through the joint. Three-dimensional laser scans of polyvinylsiloxane molds of the medial tibial condyle of gorillas (n = 40), common chimpanzees (n = 40), and modern humans (n = 40) were evaluated for differences in articular surface topography, with all measures of joint curvature examined in relation to femoral head superoinferior diameter (as a surrogate for body size). Analyses did not detect an allometric shape change in the curvature of the medial tibial condyle with increasing body size within any of the three taxa examined here. Medial tibial condyle curvature appears to be largely independent of body size as estimated by femoral head diameter. These results do not provide direct support for the hypothesis that joints become flatter in response to increased transarticular loading. Anat Rec, 293:671-679, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

The PSA-RP2 protein was not detected in seminal fluid and was cytoplasmically localised but not secreted from LNCaP or transfected PC3 prostate cells, despite secretion from transfected Cos-7 and HEK293 kidney cell lines.

Specifically, the effect of intense human-induced noise during oil exploration on wildlife is poorly understood. We explore the effect of seismic oil exploration on large mammal distribution in an 80 km(2) area of Loango National Park, Gabon Following the ecological theory of habitat disturbance, we predicted that changes in habitat use in response to noise disturbance would scale with the body/home range size of each species examined Our study was conducted over six months before, during and after low-impact seismic operations We recorded counts along transects of indirect signs of elephants (Loxondota africana cyclotis), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), duikers (Cephalophus spp.), and the vocalizations of five monkey species (Cercocebus torquatus, Cercopithecus cephus, C. nictitans, C pogonias and Lophocebus albigena) and modeled seismic impact over different spatial scales (small, intermediate and large) We found that elephants avoided seismic activity on all three spatial scales, apes avoided on the intermediate and small scales, and there was no effect for duikers and monkeys. We conclude that low-impact seismic operations can cause considerable temporary habitat loss for species with large ranges and suggest that the impact on those endangered species can be minimized by adequately spacing seismic lines and activity in space and time to enable species to move away from the progressive noise disruption (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"The Function of Male Agonistic Displays in Ursine Colobus Monkeys (Colobus vellerosus): Male Competition, Female Mate Choice or Sexual Coercion?","['Teichroeb, JA', 'Sicotte, P']",ETHOLOGY,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01752.x,APR 2010,6,"Male agonistic displays may allow males to assess competitors, females to assess mates, or could be directed at cycling females to sexually coerce them. We analysed the display output of 26 male ursine colobus monkeys (Colobus vellerosus) in four groups over 13-mo at the Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary, Ghana. Display indices (including three behaviours, loud calls, stiff-legs, and jump-displays) were calculated for males in each group. Males vary in their expression of these behaviours suggesting they are sexually selected signals. We investigated the target of displays and whether display indices varied in relation to male dominance rank, eviction of other males, copulation rate, and proceptive behaviours received from females, to assess the primary function of these behaviours. Male displays decreased in vigour over time and were targeted to other groups and males. High-ranking males displayed more than low-ranking males. Alpha male display indices correlated with the number of other males evicted from the group. Display rates were generally higher when cycling females were present in the group. However, neither male display index nor rank correlated with copulation rates. Alpha and non-alpha males gave cycling females equal rates of sexual solicitations; likewise cycling females showed no difference in the rates of proceptive behaviours directed towards alpha and non-alpha males. Females mated promiscuously and did not seem to base mating decisions on male display output, although data on female hormones is needed to determine if they mate with strongly displaying males more in the periovulatory period. The male-male competition hypothesis received the greatest support, with some support for the female mate choice hypothesis. Although behaviours that appeared sexually coercive were observed, the function of male displays did not seem to be sexual coercion. Displays were rarely directed at females and males that displayed more did not have greater mating success."
Identification of human specific gene duplications relative to other primates by array CGH and quantitative PCR,"['Armengol, G', 'Knuutila, S', 'Lozano, JJ', 'Madrigal, I', 'Caballin, MR']",GENOMICS,10.1016/j.ygeno.2010.02.003,APR 2010,4,"In order to identify human lineage specific (HLS) copy number differences (CNDs) compared to other primates, we performed pair wise comparisons (human vs. chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan) by using cDNA array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). A set of 23 genes with HLS duplications were identified, as well as other lineage differences in gene copy number specific of chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan. Each species has gained more copies of specific genes rather than losing gene copies. Eleven of the 23 genes have only been observed to have undergone HLS duplication in Fortna et al. (2004) and in the present study. Then, seven of these 11 genes were analyzed by quantitative PCR in chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan, as well as in other six primate species (Hylobates lar, Cercopithecus aethiops, Papio hamadryas, Macaca mulatta, Lagothrix lagothricha, and Saimiri sciureus). Six genes confirmed array CGH data, and four of them appeared to have bona fide HLS duplications (ABCB10, E2F6, CDH12, and TDG genes). We propose that these gene duplications have a potential to contribute to specific human phenotypes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
The Impact of Regulatory Fit on Performance in an Inattentional Blindness Paradigm,"['Memmert, D', 'Unkelbach, C', 'Ganns, S']",JOURNAL OF GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY,NA,APR-JUN 2010,10,"When people's self-regulatory focus (e.g., focus on gains vs. focus on avoiding losses) matches environmental demands (e.g., search gains vs. avoid losses), Regulatory Focus Theory predicts performance improvements because of ""regulatory fit"" (Higgins, 1997). In this article, the authors investigate attentional differences due to regulatory fit as a possible cause for changes in performance, using an inattentional blindness paradigm. Participants counted passes in a basketball game, during which an unexpected object appears (in the present study, a gorilla). We measured participants' chronic self-regulatory focus with a standardized questionnaire and experimentally manipulated their situational focus. If experimental focus fitted chronic focus, more participants detected the unexpected object compared to the nonfit conditions, suggesting that fit led to a broader scope of attention. The data are discussed in relation to other cognitive consequences of regulatory fit, and how these might explain performance differences in a wide range of tasks that do not directly follow from Regulatory Focus Theory."
What defines successful integration into a social group for hand-reared chimpanzee infants?,"['Bashaw, MJ', 'Gullott, RL', 'Gill, EC']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-009-0176-8,APR 2010,2,"Hand-rearing of captive great ape infants is sometimes necessary but can have negative behavioral consequences. Modern hand-rearing protocols, including early integration into a diverse group of conspecifics, appear to reduce the negative consequences of hand-rearing, but the process of integration is not well studied. We investigated six potential metrics of success during the introduction of two hand-reared chimpanzee infants into a troop of nine other chimpanzees at the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore. Little aggression was observed and the infants continue to be maintained in the troop at publication. As we predicted, during the introduction the hand-reared infants showed consistent levels of stress-related behaviors, participated in affiliative interactions with all available partners, and acted, received, and mutually engaged in these interactions. Solitary behaviors by these infants were similar to a mother-reared infant in the same group. Each infant also formed a relationship with a specific female that involved nest-sharing, carrying, retrieval, and intervening to reduce risk to the infant; these relationships could be classified as allomothering because they involved maternal behavior but occupied significantly less of the infants' time than a maternal relationship. Contrary to our prediction, the hand-reared infants therefore spent significantly less time in social behavior than a mother-reared infant of the same age. In addition, the hand-reared infants continued to show strong social preferences for each other as introductions progressed and to direct a low but consistent number of nonfeeding social behaviors to humans. The successful introduction of hand-reared infants appeared to involve adding conspecific social relationships to the infants' social repertoire, but not eliminating social interactions directed at humans."
"Seasonal changes in food resource distribution and feeding sites selected by Japanese macaques on Koshima Islet, Japan","['Go, M']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-009-0179-5,APR 2010,10,"Feeding sites of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) change according to seasonal fluctuations in food resource distribution. To examine what characteristics of food items affect feeding site selection, I describe herein the seasonal changes in food items, feeding sites, and food resource distributions of this species. Feeding behavior of monkeys and their food resource distributions were investigated on Koshima Islet, southern Japan, for four study periods (i.e., seasons) in 2002. Monkeys showed large variations in their diet between seasons. To weigh the relative influence of the distribution and abundance of food items on feeding site selection in each season, multiple regression analyses were performed by 100 m x 100 m grid. In the analyses, feeding time was a dependent variable and the abundance of staple food items, for which feeding time was over 5% in each season, in each grid square was an independent variable. There was no correlation between the resource distribution of most food items and the distribution of feeding time by monkeys in each season. Monkeys spent more feeding time where multiple staple food items were available. Food items that affected feeding site selection by monkeys had the following three characteristics: (1) clumped distribution, (2) seasonal availability, and (3) fruit. This suggests that monkeys are likely to select feeding sites to consume food items whose availability is limited temporally and spatially, which may enable them to simultaneously use other widely distributed, abundant food items efficiently."
Nonaggressive interventions by third parties in conflicts among captive Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus),"['Tajima, T', 'Kurotori, H']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-009-0180-z,APR 2010,5,"Whereas orangutans are regarded as semisolitary animals in the wild, several studies have reported frequent social interactions, including aggression, among orangutans in captivity. As yet, there is a lack of knowledge about how they cope with aggression. In this report, we provide a number of new observations of interventions by third parties in aggressive interactions within a captive group of Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) in the Tama Zoological Park, Japan. We observed that an adult female and a juvenile male orangutan intervened in aggressive interactions. The victim was a newly introduced juvenile female who was unrelated to anyone in the zoo. The ways in which the orangutans intervened were not aggressive, as the interveners simply aimed to separate the opponents, and these interventions did not lead to further aggression in almost every case. Our observations suggest that third parties can play an important role in managing aggressive conflicts among captive orangutans and, under conditions in which orangutans share limited space, nonaggressive interventions by third parties for settling conflicts appear. It is possible that orangutans may actively promote the peaceful coexistence of other individuals."

LC neurons are lost in the course of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In this study we used Nissl staining and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity to compare the human LC with that of closely related primate species, including great and lesser apes, and macaque monkeys. TH catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis. The number of TH-immunoreactive (TH-ir) neurons was estimated in each species using stereologic methods. In the LC of humans the mean total number of TH-ir neurons was significantly higher compared to the other primates. Because the total number of TH-ir neurons in the LC was highly correlated with the species mean volume of the medulla oblongata, cerebellum, and neocortical gray matter, we conclude that much of the observed phylogenetic variation can be explained by anatomical scaling. Notably, the total number of LC neurons in humans was most closely predicted by the nonhuman allometric scaling relationship relative to medulla size, whereas the number of LC neurons in humans was considerably lower than predicted according to neocortex and cerebellum volume.

It varies between three and four in extant African apes (mean = 3.5). Because both chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) possess the same distributions of thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae, it has been assumed from parsimony that the last common ancestor (LCA) of African apes and humans possessed a similarly short lower back. This ""short-backed LCA"" scenario has recently been viewed favorably in an analysis of the intra- and interspecific variation in axial formulas observed among African apes and humans (Pilbeam, 2004. J Exp Zool 30213:241-267). However, the number of bonobo (Pan paniscus) specimens in that study was small (N = 17). Here we reconsider vertebral type and number in the LCA in light of an expanded P. paniscus sample as well as evidence provided by the human fossil record. The precaudal (pre-coccygeal) axial column of bonobos differs from those of chimpanzees and gorillas in displaying one additional vertebra as well as significantly different combinations of sacral, lumbar, and thoracic vertebrae. These findings, along with the six-segmented lumbar column of early Australopithecus and early Homo, suggest that the LCA possessed a long axial column and long lumbar spine and that reduction in the lumbar column occurred independently in humans and in each ape clade, and continued after separation of the two species of Pan as well. Such an explanation is strongly congruent with additional details of lumbar column reduction and lower back stabilization in African apes. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 314B:723-734, 2010.

Plant Foods Consumed by Pan: Exploring the Variation of Nutritional Ecology Across Africa,"['Hohmann, G', 'Potts, K', ""N'Guessan, A"", 'Fowler, A', 'Mundry, R', 'Ganzhorn, JU', 'Ortmann, S']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21168,MAR 2010,24,"It has been shown that differences in resource density and nutrient supply affect variation in ranging patterns, habitat use, and sociality. Among nonhuman primates, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (P. paniscus) have often been used as models for the link between social system and habitat ecology. Field reports suggest that resource density is higher in habitats occupied by bonobos (compared to chimpanzee habitats), and in the West (compared to the East) of the range of chimpanzees. In this study we compared diet quality at the level of species and populations using information from nutritional analyses of fruit and leaves consumed by chimpanzees (three) and bonobos (one population). Quality of plant foods was assessed on the basis of a) the concentration of macronutrients, fiber, and anti-feedants, and b) associations of different nutrient components. Overall plant samples collected at each site differed in terms of macronutrient content. However, nutritious quality and gross energy content of food samples were similar suggesting that dietary quality reflects selectivity rather than habitat ecology. The quality of plant foods consumed by bonobos was within the range of chimpanzees and the quality of plant foods consumed by western chimpanzees was not higher than that of eastern chimpanzees. While the results showed significant variation across forests inhabited by Pan, they did not match with geographical patterns between and within Pan species as proposed in previous studies. This suggests that the nutritional quality of the habitat is not always a reliable predictor of the quality of the diet. Am J Phys Anthropol 141:476-485, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

We compared the inhibitory skills of all great ape species, including 3-5-year-old children in a detour-reaching task, which required subjects to avoid reaching directly for food and instead use an indirect reaching method to successfully obtain the food. We tested 22 chimpanzees, 18 bonobos, 18 orangutans, 6 gorillas and 42 children. Our sample included chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans housed in zoos (N = 27) and others housed in sanctuaries in their native habitats (N = 37).

Sanctuary chimpanzees and bonobos outperformed their zoo counterparts whereas there was no difference between the two orangutan samples. Most zoo chimpanzees and bonobos failed to solve the original task, but improved their performance with additional training, although the training method determined to a considerable extent the level of success that the apes achieved in a transfer phase. In general, the performance of the older children was far from perfect and comparable to some of the nonhuman apes tested."
Why do gorillas make sequences of gestures?,"['Genty, E', 'Byrne, RW']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-009-0266-4,MAR 2010,25,"Great ape gestures have attracted considerable research interest in recent years, prompted by their flexible and intentional pattern of use; but almost all studies have focused on single gestures. Here, we report the first quantitative analysis of sequential gesture use in western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), using data from three captive groups and one African study site. We found no evidence that gesture sequences were given for reasons of increased communicative efficiency over single gestures. Longer sequences of repeated gestures did not increase the likelihood of response, and using a sequence was seldom in reaction to communicative failure. Sequential combination of two gestures with similar meanings did not generally increase effectiveness, and sometimes reduced it. Gesture sequences were closely associated with play contexts. Markov transition analysis showed two networks of frequently co-occurring gestures, both consisting of gestures used to regulate play. One network comprised only tactile gestures, the other a mix of silent, audible and tactile gestures; apparently, these clusters resulted from gesture use in play with proximal or distal contact, respectively. No evidence was found for syntactic effects of sequential combination: meanings changed little or not at all. Semantically, many gestures overlapped massively with others in their core information (i.e. message), and gesture messages spanned relatively few functions. We suggest that the underlying semantics of gorilla gestures is highly simplified compared to that of human words. Gesture sequences allow continual adjustment of the tempo and nature of social interactions, rather than generally conveying semantically referential information or syntactic structures."
Variance in the male reproductive success of western gorillas: acquiring females is just the beginning,"['Breuer, T', 'Robbins, AM', 'Olejniczak, C', 'Parnell, RJ', 'Stokes, EJ', 'Robbins, MM']",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,10.1007/s00265-009-0867-6,MAR 2010,16,"Variance in male reproductive success is expected to be high in sexually dimorphic mammals, even when it is modulated by the costs and benefits of group living. Here, we investigate the variance in reproductive success of male western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), a highly dimorphic primate with long-term male-female associations, using 12.5 years of data collected at Mbeli Bai in northern Congo. Access to mates and offspring survival were both major sources of variance in male reproductive success. Males with larger harems had lower offspring mortality with no apparent reduction in female fertility or observed tenure length, so the size of harems did not seem to be limited by female feeding competition or by the risk of takeovers and infanticide by outsider males. The lower mortality in larger harems may reflect improved vigilance against predators, and females may cluster around males that enhance offspring survival. Thus, this study illustrates how a detailed analysis of the components of male reproductive success can shed light on the interrelated social and ecological aspects that affect it."
The evolution of laughter in great apes and humans.,"['Ross, Marina Davila', 'Owren, Michael J', 'Zimmermann, Elke']",Communicative & integrative biology,NA,2010-Mar,9,"It has long been claimed that human emotional expressions, such as laughter, have evolved from nonhuman displays. The aim of the current study was to test this prediction by conducting acoustic and phylogenetic analyses based on the acoustics of tickle-induced vocalizations of orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and humans. Results revealed both important similarities and differences among the various species' vocalizations, with the phylogenetic tree reconstructed based on these acoustic data matching the well-established genetic relationships of great apes and humans. These outcomes provide evidence of a common phylogenetic origin of tickle-induced vocalizations in these taxa, which can therefore be termed ""laughter"" across all five species. Results are consistent with the claims of phylogenetic continuity of emotional expressions. Together with observations made on the use of laughter in great apes and humans, findings of this study further indicate that there were two main periods of selection-driven evolutionary change in laughter within the Hominidae, to a smaller degree, among the great apes and, most distinctively, after the separation of hominins from the last common ancestor with chimpanzees and bonobos."
Intuitions about gravity and solidity in great apes: the tubes task,"['Cacchione, T', 'Call, J']",DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE,10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00881.x,MAR 2010,11,"We investigated whether great apes, like human infants, monkeys and dogs, are subject to a strong gravity bias when tested with the tubes task, and - in case of mastery - what the source of competence on the tubes task is. We presented 22 apes with three versions of the tubes task, in which an object is dropped down a tube connected to one of three potential hiding places and the subject is required to locate the object. In two versions, apes were confronted with a causal tube that varied in the amount of perceptual information it provided (i.e. presence or absence of acoustic cues). The third version was a non-causal adaptation of the task in which a painted line 'connected' dropping and hiding places. Results indicate that apes neither have a reliable gravity bias when tested with the tubes, nor understand the causal function of the tube. Even though there is evidence that they can integrate tube-related causal information to localize the object, they seem to depend mainly on non-causal inferences when searching for an invisibly displaced object."

This new species has a spherical body with a frontal lobe, a long vestibulum, a cytoproct located at the posterior dorsal side of the body, an ovoid macronucleus, a contractile vacuole near the cytoproct, and a large concavity on the left surface of the body. Buccal ciliature is non-retractable and consists of three ciliary zones: an adoral zone surrounding the vestibular opening, a dorso-adoral zone extending transversely at the basis of the frontal lobe, and a vestibular zone longitudinally extending in a gently spiral curve to line the surface of the vestibulum. Two non-retractable somatic ciliary zones comprise arches over the body surface: a short dorsal ciliary arch extending transversely at the basis of the frontal lobe and a wide C-shaped left ciliary arch in the left concavity. Because of the presence of three ciliary zones in the non-retractable buccal ciliature, the present genus might be a member of the family Blepharocorythidae, but the large left concavity and the C-shaped left ciliary arch are unique, such structures have never been described from other blepharocorythids."

Twenty-one novel viruses were detected. Together with previous findings, more than 50 distinct lymphocryptoviruses (LCVs) are now known, with hosts from six primate families (Hominidae, Hylobatidae, Cercopithecidae, Atelidae, Cebidae and Pitheciidae). Further work extended genomic sequences for 25 LCVs to 3.4-7.4 kbp. Phylogenetic trees were constructed, based on alignments of protein sequences inferred from the LCV genomic data. The LCVs fell into three major clades: Clade A, comprising New World viruses; Clade B, containing both Old World monkey viruses and hominoid viruses including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); and Clade C, containing other hominoid viruses. By comparison with the primate tree, it was proposed that major elements of the LCV tree represented synchronous evolution with host lineages, with the earliest node in both trees being the separation of Old and New World lines, but that some virus lineages originated by interspecies transfer. From comparisons of branch lengths, it was inferred that evolutionary substitution in Clade B has proceeded more slowly than elsewhere in the LCV tree. It was estimated that in Clade B a subclade containing EBV, a gorilla virus and two chimpanzee viruses derived from an Old World monkey LCV line approximately 12 million years ago, and another subclade containing an orang-utan virus and a gibbon virus derived from a macaque LCV line approximately 1.2 million years ago."

Vertebrate DNA in Fecal Samples from Bonobos and Gorillas: Evidence for Meat Consumption or Artefact?,"['Hofreiter, M', 'Kreuz, E', 'Eriksson, J', 'Schubert, G', 'Hohmann, G']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0009419,FEB 25 2010,7,"Background: Deciphering the behavioral repertoire of great apes is a challenge for several reasons. First, due to their elusive behavior in dense forest environments, great ape populations are often difficult to observe. Second, members of the genus Pan are known to display a great variety in their behavioral repertoire; thus, observations from one population are not necessarily representative for other populations. For example, bonobos (Pan paniscus) are generally believed to consume almost no vertebrate prey. However, recent observations show that at least some bonobo populations may consume vertebrate prey more commonly than previously believed. We investigated the extent of their meat consumption using PCR amplification of vertebrate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) segments from DNA extracted from bonobo feces. As a control we also attempted PCR amplifications from gorilla feces, a species assumed to be strictly herbivorous.

Principal Findings: We found evidence for consumption of a variety of mammalian species in about 16% of the samples investigated. Moreover, 40% of the positive DNA amplifications originated from arboreal monkeys. However, we also found duiker and monkey mtDNA in the gorilla feces, albeit in somewhat lower percentages. Notably, the DNA sequences isolated from the two ape species fit best to the species living in the respective regions. This result suggests that the sequences are of regional origin and do not represent laboratory contaminants.

Conclusions: Our results allow at least three possible and mutually not exclusive conclusions. First, all results may represent contamination of the feces by vertebrate DNA from the local environment. Thus, studies investigating a species' diet from feces DNA may be unreliable due to the low copy number of DNA originating from diet items. Second, there is some inherent difference between the bonobo and gorilla feces, with only the later ones being contaminated. Third, similar to bonobos, for which the consumption of monkeys has only recently been documented, the gorilla population investigated (for which very little observational data are as yet available) may occasionally consume small vertebrates. Although the last explanation is speculative, it should not be discarded a-priori given that observational studies continue to unravel new behaviors in great ape species."
Mobile elements reveal small population size in the ancient ancestors of Homo sapiens,"['Huff, CD', 'Xing, JC', 'Rogers, AR', 'Witherspoon, D', 'Jorde, LB']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0909000107,FEB 2 2010,18,"The genealogies of different genetic loci vary in depth. The deeper the genealogy, the greater the chance that it will include a rare event, such as the insertion of a mobile element. Therefore, the genealogy of a region that contains a mobile element is on average older than that of the rest of the genome. In a simple demographic model, the expected time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) is doubled if a rare insertion is present. We test this expectation by examining single nucleotide polymorphisms around polymorphic Alu insertions from two completely sequenced human genomes. The estimated TMRCA for regions containing a polymorphic insertion is two times larger than the genomic average (P < < 10(-30)), as predicted. Because genealogies that contain polymorphic mobile elements are old, they are shaped largely by the forces of ancient population history and are insensitive to recent demographic events, such as bottlenecks and expansions. Remarkably, the information in just two human DNA sequences provides substantial information about ancient human population size. By comparing the likelihood of various demographic models, we estimate that the effective population size of human ancestors living before 1.2 million years ago was 18,500, and we can reject all models where the ancient effective population size was larger than 26,000. This result implies an unusually small population for a species spread across the entire Old World, particularly in light of the effective population sizes of chimpanzees (21,000) and gorillas (25,000), which each inhabit only one part of a single continent."

Even if this group includes such important laboratory animal models as domestic mouse (Mus musculus), Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus), and golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), comparative cytogenetic studies between rodents are difficult due to the characteristic rapid karyotypic evolution. Molecular cytogenetic methods can help resolve problems of comparing muroid chromosomes. Here, we used cross-species comparative multicolour banding with probes obtained from mouse chromosomes 3, 6, 18, and 19 to study the karyotypes of nine muroid species from the three subfamilies Murinae, Cricetinae, and Arvicolinae. Results from multicolour banding with these murine probes (mcb) allowed us to improve the comparative homology maps between these species and to obtain new insights into their karyotypic evolution. We identified evolutionary conserved chromosomal breakpoints and revealed four previously unrecognized homologous segments, four inversions, and 14 evolutionary new centromeres in the nine muroid species studied. We found Mus apomorphic rearrangements, not seen in other muroids, and defined several subfamily specific chromosome breaks, characteristic for Arvicolinae and Cricetinae. We show that mcb libraries are an effective tool both for the cytogenetic characterisation of important laboratory models such as the rat and hamster as well as elucidating the complex phylogenomics relationships of muroids."

The majority of these gorillas were imported with little or no information regarding their original provenance and no information on their genetic relatedness. Here, we analyze 32 microsatellite loci in 144 individuals using a Bayesian clustering method to delineate clusters of individuals among a sample of founders of the captive North American zoo gorilla collection. We infer that the majority of North American zoo founders sampled are distributed into two distinct clusters, and that some individuals are of admixed ancestry. This new information regarding the existence of ancestral genetic population structure in the North American zoo population lays the groundwork for enhanced efforts to conserve the evolutionary units of the western lowland gorilla gene pool. Our data also show that the genetic diversity estimates in the founder population were comparable to those in wild gorilla populations (Mondika and Cross River), and that pairwise relatedness among the founders is no different from that expected for a random mating population. However, the relatively high level of relatedness (R = 0.54) we discovered in a pair of known breeding pairs reveals the need for incorporating genetic relatedness estimates in the captive management of western lowland gorillas."
Local economic impact of different forms of nature-based tourism,"['Sandbrook, CG']",CONSERVATION LETTERS,10.1111/j.1755-263X.2009.00085.x,FEB 2010,13,"Tourism has been widely used as a component of conservation interventions which are intended to deliver benefits to local people, thereby contributing to development and creating incentives for conservation. However, a large proportion of total tourist revenue can be lost from the local area as leakage. Nature-based tourism is diverse and little is known about how locally retained revenue varies across different forms of tourism; this is information of great importance to policymakers. This article uses data from tourist interviews and local enterprise surveys to measure the total and locally retained spending from different forms of tourism at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. Whilst total spending increased with higher cost forms of tourism and length of stay, retained spending was predicted only by length of stay. High-cost tourism may therefore be no more effective than other forms of tourism as a tool for generating local benefits from conservation."

Specifically, the genus Homo is said to be characterized by larger femoral heads, shorter femoral necks, and more lateral flare of the greater trochanter than are members of the genera Australopithecus or Paranthropus. Here, a digitizing arm was used to collect landmark data on recent human (n=82), chimpanzee (n=16), and gorilla (n=20) femora and casts of six fossil hominin femora in order to test whether one can discriminate extant and fossil hominid (sensu faro) femora into different taxa using three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometric analyses. Twenty proximal femoral landmarks were chosen to best quantify the shape differences between hominin genera. These data were first subjected to Procrustes analysis. The resultant fitted coordinate values were then subjected to PCA. PC scores were used to compute a dissimilarity matrix that was subjected to cluster analyses. Results indicate that one can easily distinguish Homo, Pan, and Gorilla from each other based on proximal femur shape, and one can distinguish Pliocene and Early Pleistocene hominin femora from those of recent Homo. It is more difficult to distinguish Early Pleistocene Homo proximal femora from those of Australopithecus or Paranthropus, but cluster analyses appear to separate the fossil hominins into four groups: an early australopith cluster that is an outlier from other fossil hominins; and two clusters that are sister taxa to each other: a late australopith/Paranthropus group and an early Homo group.

Environmental enrichment for captive stumptail macaques (Macaca arctoides),"['Marquez-Arias, A', 'Santillan-Doherty, AM', 'Arenas-Rosas, RV', 'Gasca-Matias, MP', 'Munoz-Delgado, J']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1111/j.1600-0684.2009.00392.x,FEB 2010,6,"Background

The behavior of animals is modified by captivity. Environmental enrichment (EE) is a program designed to enhance the welfare of confined animals by providing them with a more stimulating background. This is carried out by the implementation of a series of activities that encourages them to present behaviors typical of their species, as well as keeps them active. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the influence of the EE in the behavioral variables in a colony of 24 stumptail macaques (Macaca arctoides). Our hypothesis is that the application of this program will reduce aggression, stereotypes and coprophilia behaviors and, at the same time, will increase exploration and solitary play.

Methods

The behavioral frequency previous to EE was compared with that during EE implementation.

Results

Our results showed that aggression, coprophilia stereotypic behaviors and social play were significantly reduced during EE, whereas exploration was significantly enhanced. The response of the individuals according to gender was similar for both sexes.

Conclusions

Environmental enrichment programs are indispensable for captive animals' wellbeing as they reduce aggression and stress while providing animals both physical and cognitive entertainment."

Phylogenetic analyses showed that gorillas acquired the simian immunodeficiency virus SIVgor from chimpanzees, and viruses from the SIVcpz/SIVgor lineage have been transmitted to humans on at least four occasions, leading to HIV-1 groups M, N, O, and P. To determine the geographic distribution, prevalence, and species association of SIVgor, we conducted a comprehensive molecular epidemiological survey of wild gorillas in Central Africa. Gorilla fecal samples were collected in the range of western lowland gorillas (n = 2,367) and eastern Grauer gorillas (n = 183) and tested for SIVgor antibodies and nucleic acids. SIVgor antibody-positive samples were identified at 2 sites in Cameroon, with no evidence of infection at 19 other sites, including 3 in the range of the Eastern gorillas. In Cameroon, based on DNA and microsatellite analyses of a subset of samples, we estimated the prevalence of SIVgor to be 1.6% (range, 0% to 4.6%), which is significantly lower than the prevalence of SIVcpzPtt in chimpanzees (5.9%; range, 0% to 32%). All newly identified SIVgor strains formed a monophyletic lineage within the SIVcpz radiation, closely related to HIV-1 groups O and P, and clustered according to their field site of origin. At one site, there was evidence for intergroup transmission and a high intragroup prevalence. These isolated hot spots of SIVgor-infected gorilla communities could serve as a source for human infection. The overall low prevalence and sporadic distribution of SIVgor could suggest a decline of SIVgor in wild populations, but it cannot be excluded that SIVgor is still more prevalent in other parts of the geographical range of gorillas."

Recently, Plasmodium gaboni, another closely related chimpanzee parasite, was discovered, suggesting that the diversity of Plasmodium circulating in great apes in Africa might have been underestimated. It was also recently shown that P. reichenowi is a geographically widespread and genetically diverse chimpanzee parasite and that the world diversity of P. falciparum is fully included within the much broader genetic diversity of P. reichenowi. The evidence indicates that all extant populations of P. falciparum originated from P. reichenowi, likely by a single transfer from chimpanzees. In this work, we have studied the diversity of Plasmodium species infecting chimpanzees and gorillas in Central Africa (Cameroon and Gabon) from both wild-living and captive animals. The studies in wild apes used noninvasive sampling methods. We confirm the presence of P. reichenowi and P. gaboni in wild chimpanzees. Moreover, our results reveal the existence of an unexpected genetic diversity of Plasmodium lineages circulating in gorillas. We show that gorillas are naturally infected by two related lineages of parasites that have not been described previously, herein referred to as Plasmodium GorA and P.

Among extant primates, the timing of many life-history attributes is correlated with the age at emergence of the first permanent molar (M1), which can therefore serve as a means to directly compare the life histories of fossil and extant species. To date, M1 emergence ages exist for only a small fraction of extant primate species and consist primarily of data from captive individuals, which may show accelerated dental eruption compared with free-living individuals. Data on M1 emergence ages in wild great apes exist for only a single chimpanzee individual, with data for gorillas and orangutans being anecdotal. This paucity of information limits our ability to make life-history inferences using the M1 emergence ages of extinct ape and hominin species. Here we report reliable ages at M1 emergence for the orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus (4.6 y), and the gorilla, Gorilla gorilla (3.8 y), obtained from the dental histology of wild-shot individuals in museum collections. These ages and the one reported age at M1 emergence in a free-living chimpanzee of approximately 4.0 y are highly concordant with the comparative life histories of these great apes. They are also consistent with the average age at M1 emergence in relation to the timing of life-history events in modern humans, thus confirming the utility of M1 emergence ages for life-history inference and providing a basis for making reliable life-history inferences for extinct apes and hominins."

Two 3D approaches are used to quantify curvatures of the trapezial and metacarpal joint surfaces: (1) stereophotogrammetry with nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) calculation of joint curvature to compare modern humans with captive chimpanzees and (2) laser scanning with a quadric-based calculation of curvature to compare modern humans and wild-caught Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, and Papio. Both approaches show that Homo has significantly lower curvature of the joint surfaces than does Pan. The second approach shows that Gorilla has significantly more curvature than modern humans, while Pongo overlaps with humans and African apes. The surfaces in Papio are more cylindrical and flatter than in Homo. Australopithecus afarensis resembles African apes more than modern humans in curvatures, whereas the Homo habilis trapezial metacarpal surface is flatter than in all genera except Papio. Neandertals fall at one end of the modern human range of variation, with smaller dorsovolar curvature. Modern human topography appears to be derived relative to great apes and Australopithecus and contributes to the distinctive human morphology that facilitates forceful precision and power gripping, fundamental to human manipulative activities.

Joint Orientation and Function in Great Ape and Human Proximal Pedal Phalanges,"['Griffin, NL', 'Richmond, BG', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21121,JAN 2010,13,"Previous studies have referred to the degree of dorsal canting of the base of the proximal phalanx as an indicator of human-like metatarsophalangeal joint function and thus a diagnostic trait of habitual bipedality in the fossil record. Here, we used a simple method to investigate differences in forefoot function on a finer scale. Building on Duncan et al.'s (Am J Phys Anthropol 93 [1994] 67-81) research, we tested whether dorsal canting reflects differences between sexes in locomotor behavior, whether habitual shoe wear influences dorsal canting in humans, and whether proximal joint morphology differs between rays in Pan and humans. Our results corroborate previous research in showing that humans have proximal phalanges with joint orientations that are significantly more dorsal than, but overlap with, those of great apes. We also found that male gorillas have significantly more dorsally canted second proximal phalanges than their female counterparts, while the opposite pattern between the sexes was found in Pan troglodytes. Inter-ray comparisons indicate that Pan have more dorsally canted first proximal phalanges than second proximal phalanges, while the opposite pattern was found in humans. Minimally shod humans have slightly but significantly more dorsally canted second proximal phalanges than those of habitually shod humans, indicating that phalanges of unshod humans provide the most appropriate comparative samples for analyses of early hominins. Overall, our analysis suggests that though the measurement of dorsal canting is limited in its sensitivity to certain intraspecific differences in function, phalangeal joint orientation reflects interspecific differences in joint function, with the caveat that different patterns of forefoot function during gait can involve similar articular sets of metatarsophalangeal joints.

Small folivorous primate groups exhibit behavioral and physiological effects of food scarcity,"['Harris, TR', 'Chapman, CA', 'Monfort, SL']",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,10.1093/beheco/arp150,JAN-FEB 2010,28,"The influence of diet and food distribution on the socioecology of group-living species has long been debated, particularly for primates. It has typically been assumed that folivorous primates experience relatively little feeding competition due to the abundant, widespread nature of their food, freeing them to form large groups in response to predation, to disperse with relative ease, and to have egalitarian female social relationships. Recent studies, however, have come to different conclusions about the extent to which folivorous primates are limited by food and experience food competition and how these factors affect folivore socioecology. To better understand the selective pressures that diet places on folivores, we investigated how 2 small highly folivorous groups of colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza) in Kibale National Park, Uganda, responded behaviorally and physiologically to a steep reduction in availability of their most important foods. The monkeys decreased their reliance on their 2 most frequently eaten food species and increased their daily path length, number of feeding patches visited/day, size of individual feeding areas, percentage of time spent feeding, and dietary diversity. They also showed evidence of physiological costs, in that lactating females' urinary C-peptide levels (i.e., insulin production) declined as top foods became scarce, and parasite loads slightly, but significantly, increased in 2 of 3 adult females examined. These results suggest that highly folivorous primates, even in very small groups, may experience behavioral and physiological effects of food limitation, within-group scramble competition for food, and possibly substantial selective pressures during periods of food scarcity."
Animal tool use: current definitions and an updated comprehensive catalog,"['Bentley-Condit, VK', 'Smith, EO']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/000579509X12512865686555,2010,42,"Despite numerous attempts to define animal tool use over the past four decades, the definition remains elusive and the behaviour classification somewhat subjective. Here, we provide a brief review of the definitions of animal tool use and show how those definitions have been modified over time. While some aspects have remained constant (i.e., the distinction between 'true' and 'borderline' tool use), others have been added (i.e., the distinction between 'dynamic' and 'static' behaviours). We present an updated, comprehensive catalog of documented animal tool use that indicates whether the behaviours observed included any 'true' tool use, whether the observations were limited to captive animals, whether tool manufacture has been observed, and whether the observed tool use was limited to only one individual and, thus, 'anecdotal' (i.e., N = 1). Such a catalog has not been attempted since Beck (1980). In addition to being a useful reference for behaviourists, this catalog demonstrates broad tool use and manufacture trends that may be of interest to phylogenists, evolutionary ecologists, and cognitive evolutionists. Tool use and tool manufacture are shown to be widespread across three phyla and seven classes of the animal kingdom. Moreover, there is complete overlap between the Aves and Mammalia orders in terms of the tool use categories (e. g., food extraction, food capture, agonism) arguing against any special abilities of mammals. The majority of tool users, almost 85% of the entries, use tools in only one of the tool use categories. Only members of the Passeriformes and Primates orders have been observed to use tools in four or more of the ten categories. Thus, observed tool use by some members of these two orders (e. g., Corvus, Papio) is qualitatively different from that of all other animal taxa. Finally, although there are similarities between Aves and Mammalia, and Primates and Passeriformes, primate tool use is qualitatively different. Approximately 35% of the entries for this order demonstrate a breadth of tool use (i.e., three or more categories by any one species) compared to other mammals (0%), Aves (2.4%), and the Passeriformes (3.1%). This greater breadth in tool use by some organisms may involve phylogenetic or cognitive differences - or may simply reflect differences in length and intensity of observations. The impact that tool usage may have had on groups' respective ecological niches and, through niche-construction, on their respective evolutionary trajectories remains a subject for future study."
Paleolithic public goods games: why human culture and cooperation did not evolve in one step,"['Dubreuil, B']",BIOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY,10.1007/s10539-009-9177-7,JAN 2010,13,"It is widely agreed that humans have specific abilities for cooperation and culture that evolved since their split with their last common ancestor with chimpanzees. Many uncertainties remain, however, about the exact moment in the human lineage when these abilities evolved. This article argues that cooperation and culture did not evolve in one step in the human lineage and that the capacity to stick to long-term and risky cooperative arrangements evolved before properly modern culture. I present evidence that Homo heidelbergensis became increasingly able to secure contributions form others in two demanding Paleolithic public good games (PPGGs): cooperative feeding and cooperative breeding. I argue that the temptation to defect is high in these PPGGs and that the evolution of human cooperation in Homo heidelberngensis is best explained by the emergence of modern-like abilities for inhibitory control and goal maintenance. These executive functions are localized in the prefrontal cortex and allow humans to stick to social norms in the face of competing motivations. This scenario is consistent with data on brain evolution that indicate that the largest growth of the prefrontal cortex in human evolution occurred in Homo heidelbergensis and was followed by relative stasis in this part of the brain. One implication of this argument is that subsequent behavioral innovations, including the evolution of symbolism, art, and properly cumulative culture in modern Homo sapiens, are unlikely to be related to a reorganization of the prefrontal cortex, despite frequent claims to the contrary in the literature on the evolution of human culture and cognition."
Identification of differences in human and great ape phytanic acid metabolism that could influence gene expression profiles and physiological functions.,"['Watkins, Paul A', 'Moser, Ann B', 'Toomer, Cicely B', 'Steinberg, Steven J', 'Moser, Hugo W', 'Karaman, Mazen W', 'Ramaswamy, Krishna', 'Siegmund, Kimberly D', 'Lee, D Rick', 'Ely, John J', 'Ryder, Oliver A', 'Hacia, Joseph G']",BMC physiology,10.1186/1472-6793-10-19,2010 Oct 08,9,"BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that anatomical differences in human and great ape guts arose in response to species-specific diets and energy demands. To investigate functional genomic consequences of these differences, we compared their physiological levels of phytanic acid, a branched chain fatty acid that can be derived from the microbial degradation of chlorophyll in ruminant guts. Humans who accumulate large stores of phytanic acid commonly develop cerebellar ataxia, peripheral polyneuropathy, and retinitis pigmentosa in addition to other medical conditions. Furthermore, phytanic acid is an activator of the PPAR-alpha transcription factor that influences the expression of genes relevant to lipid metabolism.

RESULTS: Despite their trace dietary phytanic acid intake, all great ape species had elevated red blood cell (RBC) phytanic acid levels relative to humans on diverse diets. Unlike humans, chimpanzees showed sexual dimorphism in RBC phytanic acid levels, which were higher in males relative to females. Cultured skin fibroblasts from all species had a robust capacity to degrade phytanic acid. We provide indirect evidence that great apes, in contrast to humans, derive significant amounts of phytanic acid from the hindgut fermentation of plant materials. This would represent a novel reduction of metabolic activity in humans relative to the great apes.

CONCLUSION: We identified differences in the physiological levels of phytanic acid in humans and great apes and propose this is causally related to their gut anatomies and microbiomes. Phytanic acid levels could contribute to cross-species and sex-specific differences in human and great ape transcriptomes, especially those related to lipid metabolism. Based on the medical conditions caused by phytanic acid accumulation, we suggest that differences in phytanic acid metabolism could influence the functions of human and great ape nervous, cardiovascular, and skeletal systems."
Performance of distance-based DNA barcoding in the molecular identification of Primates,"['Nijman, V', 'Aliabadian, M']",COMPTES RENDUS BIOLOGIES,10.1016/j.crvi.2009.10.003,JAN 2010,12,"For comparative primatology proper recognition of basal taxa (i.e. species) is indispensable, and in this the choice of a suitable gene with high phylogenetic resolution is crucial. For the goals of species identification in animals, the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) has been introduced as standard marker. Making use of the difference in intra- and interspecific genetic variation - the DNA barcoding gap - cox1 can be used as a fast and accurate marker for the identification of animal species. For the Order Primates we compare the performance of cox1 (166 sequences; 50 nominal species) in species-identification with that of two other mitochondrial markers, 16S ribosomal RNA (412 sequences, 92 species) and cytochrome b (cob: 547 sequences, 72 species). A wide gap exist between intra- and interspecific divergences for both cox1 and cob genes whereas this gap is less apparent for 165, indicating that rRNA genes are less suitable for species delimitation in DNA barcoding. For those species where multiple sequences are available there are significant differences in the intraspecific genetic distances between different mitochondrial markers, without, however, showing a consistent pattern. We conclude that cox1 allows accurate differentiation of species and as such DNA barcoding may have an important role to play in comparative primatology. (C) 2009 Academie des sciences.

Benefits to the poor from gorilla tourism in Rwanda,"['Spenceley, A', 'Habyalimana, S', 'Tusabe, R', 'Mariza, D']",DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA,10.1080/0376835X.2010.522828,2010,2,"Tourism is currently the leading export sector in Rwanda and is growing.

It quantifies pro-poor income and non-financial benefits from gorilla tourism, and describes the opportunities for the poor to become economically involved in the value chains relating to accommodation, food and beverages, excursions and shopping, and the barriers to their involvement. To increase local benefits from gorilla tourism and other tourism activities around the Park, the authors recommend stimulating the activities of the private sector, increasing the number of joint venture agreements, enhancing opportunities for local employment and career progression, and improving business linkages with entrepreneurs and entertainers."
Yank the Other: O’Neill’s The Hairy Ape,['임미진'],English21,NA,2010,0,"In The Hairy Ape, Yank, a stoker on a cargo ship, believes, with a strong sense of pride and dignity, the firemen’s forecastle where he works is the center of the world and that it is himself who moves the world. But one day Mildred, who represents the bourgeois class, appears to Yank in the shape of a “white ghost” and gives him a great shock by calling him a “filthy beast!”. The sense of humiliation and anger Mildred triggers in him is the driving force which motivates Yank’s subsequent actions. He leaves the stokehole where he has belonged and goes out into the New York streets. But he soon realizes that he is an ‘other’ in this developed and industrialized world. He tries hard to communicate with the people of the bourgeois class whom he encounters in both positive and negative situations only in vain. He is expelled even from the labor organization that he has thought he belongs to. In such a process he discovers his true self and, in the end, to identify his own existence as an ‘other’ he offers his hand to a gorilla in the zoo and puts an end to his struggle to save himself in death. This is indeed a good example of the fate of the other not accepted to the materialistic capitalist society. This is a play about the struggle for a human dignity of a man as the other in the face of the ruthless power of the stratified society and the tyrannical of industrialization."
The Dynamics of OTC Derivatives Regulation: Bridging the Public-Private Divide,"['Awrey, D']",EUROPEAN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION LAW REVIEW,10.1017/S1566752910200010,2010,6,"Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives have emerged as a global behemoth the '800 pound gorilla' of modern financial markets In the wake of both their precipitous growth and prominence in the thick of the current global financial crisis, financial market regulators have found themselves under pressure to enhance their regulation of OTC derivatives markets. This paper explores both the private and social costs and benefits of OTC derivatives and the respective strengths and weaknesses of public and private systems of ordering in pursuit of the optimal mode of regulating OTC derivatives markets. On the basis of this exploration, this paper advocates employing modes of regulation which abandon the largely artificial distinction between public and private ordering, align the incentives of public and private actors and facilitate the long-term transfer of information and expertise between these actors in order to generate more nuanced and responsive regulation and thereby enhance social welfare."
MORPHOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR EVIDENCE REVEALS RECENT HYBRIDIZATION BETWEEN GORILLA TAXA,"['Ackermann, RR', 'Bishop, JM']",EVOLUTION,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00858.x,JAN 2010,19,"Molecular studies have demonstrated a deep lineage split between the two gorilla species, as well as divisions within these taxa; estimates place this divergence in the mid-Pleistocene, with gene flow continuing until approximately 80,000 years ago. Here, we present analyses of skeletal data indicating the presence of substantial recent gene flow among gorillas at all taxonomic levels: between populations, subspecies, and species. Complementary analyses of DNA sequence variation suggest that low-level migration occurred primarily in awesterly-to-easterly direction. In western gorillas, the locations of hybrid phenotypes map closely to expectations based on population refugia and riverine barrier hypotheses, supporting the presence of significant vicariance-driven structuring and occasional admixture within this taxon. In eastern lowland gorillas, the high frequency of hybrid phenotypes is surprising, suggesting that this region represents a zone of introgression between eastern gorillas and migrants from the west, and underscoring the conservation priority of this critically endangered group. These results highlight the complex nature of evolutionary divergence in this genus, indicate that historical gene flow has played a major role in structuring gorilla diversity, and demonstrate that our understanding of the evolutionary processes responsible for shaping biodiversity can benefit immensely from consideration of morphological and molecular data in conjunction."
Cryptosporidium in wild placental mammals,"['Feng, YY']",EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/j.exppara.2008.11.005,JAN 2010,27,"Cryptosporidium species are common parasites of wild placental mammals. Recent parasitological studies combined with molecular genotyping techniques have been providing valuable new insight into the host specificity and potential transmission of various Cryptosporidium species/genotypes among animals and between these animals and humans. Although Cryptosporidium in wild animals may possess a potential public health problem due to oocyst contamination in the environment, studies at various regions of the world have indicated a strong host-adaptation by these parasites and a limited potential of cross-species transmission of cryptosporidiosis among placental mammals, suggesting that these animals are probably not a major reservoir for human infection. However, Cryptosporidium species/genotypes in placental animals have been reported occasionally in humans. Therefore, public health significance of some Cryptosporidium species in wild placental mammals, such as the cervine genotype, should not be overlooked and should be further studied.

Influence of the Task on Hand Preference: Individual Differences among Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Pouydebat, E', 'Reghem, E', 'Gorce, P', 'Bels, V']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000322552,2010,8,"The degree of task complexity and bimanual complementarity have been proposed as factors affecting lateralization strength in humans. However, a large number of studies have demonstrated group-level lateral hand bias for different manual activities in numerous non-human primate species. However, no study has tested the effects that a variety of tasks may have in inducing differences in hand preference. Here, we aim to test if 3 adult gorillas exhibited a greater hand preference bias performing 4 tasks of varying complexity: grasping small versus large foods, proto-tool use task and tool use task involving greater visuospatial requirements. We found that (1) the complexity of the task does not necessarily induce a right-handed bias and (2) a subject can be right-handed for a complex task and left-handed for another one. These results, complemented by many publications on hand preference in non-human primates, reveal a great variability in hand preference, which makes it very difficult to deduce any details of hominin handedness with artefacts.

A Likelihood Ratio Test of Speciation with Gene Flow Using Genomic Sequence Data,"['Yang, ZH']",GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/gbe/evq011,2010,25,"Genomic sequence data may be used to test hypotheses about the process of species formation. In this paper, I implement a likelihood ratio test of variable species divergence times over the genome, which may be considered a test of the null model of allopatric speciation without gene flow against the alternative model of parapatric speciation with gene flow. Two models are implemented in the likelihood framework, which accommodate coalescent events in the ancestral populations in a phylogeny of three species. One model assumes a constant species divergence time over the genome, whereas another allows it to vary. Computer simulation shows that the test has acceptable false positive rate but to achieve reasonable power, hundreds or even thousands of genomic loci may be necessary. The test is applied to genomic data from the human, chimpanzee, and gorilla."
Monkeying around with the gorillas in our midst: familiarity with an inattentional-blindness task does not improve the detection of unexpected events,"['Simons, DJ']",I-PERCEPTION,10.1068/i0386,2010,13,"When people know to look for an unexpected event (eg, a gorilla in a basketball game), they tend to notice that event.

Subjects watched a new video in which, in addition to the gorilla, two other unexpected events occurred: a curtain changed color, and one player left the scene. Subjects who knew about videos like this one consistently spotted the gorilla in the new video, but they were slightly less likely to notice the other events.

"The ontogeny of triadic cooperative interactions with humans in an infant gorilla
","['Gomez, JC']",INTERACTION STUDIES,10.1075/is.11.3.02gom,2010,8,"This paper reports a longitudinal study on the ontogeny of triadic cooperative interactions (involving coordinations of objects and people) in a hand-reared lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from 6 months to 36 months of age. Using the behavioural categories developed by Hubley and Trevarthen (1979) to characterize the origins of ""secondary intersubjectivity"" in human babies between 8-12 months of age, I chart the emergence of comparable coordinations of gestures and actions with objects and acts of dyadic communication. The findings show that the categories and concepts of secondary intersubjectivity are applicable to the gorilla, who engages with people in cooperative actions with objects. The ontogeny of triadic interaction in the gorilla was very similar to that described in human infants, but more extended in time and with some peculiarities, such as the absence of pointing and showing gestures, some of whose functions might be taken over by contact gestures which in human infants may appear later in development. The results do not support claims of human uniqueness in the development of cooperative action, but suggest a heterochrony in some aspects of the ontogeny of triadic interactions leading to a divergence between gorilla and human infants within secondary intersubjectivity."
Siamangs (Hylobates syndactylus) and White-Cheeked Gibbons (Hylobates leucogenys) Show Few Behavioral Differences Related to Zoo Attendance,"['Smith, KN', 'Kuhar, CW']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,10.1080/10888700903579895,2010,9,"The effect of visitors on behavior and welfare of nonhuman animals in the zoo has been an active research topic during the last few decades. Although research has variously shown negative or positive impacts of zoo visitors on animals in captivity, previous primate research at Disney's Animal Kingdom (R) suggests the importance of visual barriers in allowing animals to cope with large crowds. Examining this further, this study monitored the behavior of white-cheeked gibbons (Hylobates leucogenys) and siamangs (Hylobates syndactylus) in large, open exhibits. Behavioral data showed rates of social behavior and percentage of time engaged in solitary behavior did not differ between low and high visitor-attendance days. Both gibbons and siamangs spent more time in areas away from the public on high attendance days. Supporting previous findings, results imply visual barriers and ability to retreat from crowds may have provided these animals with choice and minimized potential negative visitor impact. Future research should focus on the relationship between attendance and actual crowds at exhibits; it should utilize multi-institutional methodologies to control for variance and look for individual and demographic differences between individuals."
Kinematic parameters inferred from enamel microstructure: new insights into the diet of Australopithecus anamensis,"['Macho, GA', 'Shimizu, D']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2009.07.004,JAN 2010,15,"The dietary adaptations of Australopithecus anamensis are contentious, with suggestions that range from soft fruits to hard, brittle, tough, and abrasive foods. It is unlikely that all propositions are equally valid, however. Here we extend recent finite element (FE) analyses of enamel microstructure (Shimizu and Macho, 2008) to enquire about the range of loading directions (i.e., kinematics) to which A. anamensis enamel microstructure/molars could safely be subjected. The rationale underlying this study is the observation that hard brittle foods are broken down in crush, while tough foods require shear. The findings are compared with those of Pan and Gorilla.

Eighteen detailed FE models of enamel microstructure were created and analysed. The results highlight the uniqueness ofA. anamensis dental structure and imply that mastication in this species included a greater shear component than in Pan, as well as a wider range of loading directions; it is similar to that in Gofflla in this respect. These findings are in accord with microwear studies (Grine et al., 2006a). Unlike either of the great apes, however, enamel microstructure of A. anamensis was found to be poorly equipped to withstand loading parallel to the dentino-enamel junction; such loading regimes are associated with mastication of soft fleshy fruits. This, together with broader morphological considerations, raises doubts as to whether A. anamensis was essentially a frugivore that expanded its dietary niche as a result of fluctuations in environmental conditions, e.g., during seasonal food shortages. Instead, it is more parsimonious to conclude that the habitual diet ofA. anamensis differed considerably from that of either of the extant African great apes.

"Survey of Raphia swamp forest, Republic of Congo, indicates high densities of Critically Endangered western lowland gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla

Preliminary surveys for apes on the Reserve periphery in the 1990s indicated that this area may also contain high densities of apes and we wished to verify this. Using distance sampling methodology we surveyed 1,029 km(2) of the south-eastern Reserve periphery including Raphia swamp forests. We recorded 1,021 ape nests along 21 2-km transects. Results indicated that ape density estimated from nest group density, excluding old and very old Raphia nests (which may decay slowly), was very high: 6.81 weaned apes km(-2) (95% confidence interval 3.93-11.84). Gorillas built most of the nests recorded: their density was estimated at 5.25 individuals km(-2) (2.70-10.19). Most nests were constructed in Raphia swamp forest despite it covering only 25% of the study area. These are among the highest recorded densities of apes in Central Africa but, as nest decay rates in swamps are unstudied, we also estimated densities based on hypothetically slow nest decay rates and published data from other habitats. Gorilla densities may be linked to availability of monocotyledons as food and the natural protection from hunting offered by Raphia swamps. Gorilla density in swamp forest is spatially and temporally variable and surveys are required to estimate ape populations elsewhere in this habitat. Most Raphia swamps in Congo are unprotected, including the periphery of Lac Tele Community Reserve; protection and management are required to assure their continued availability for apes."

We aimed to identify factors influencing infection risk for specific intestinal parasites in wild orangutans and individuals living in captivity. Various genera of Protozoa (including Entamoeba, Endolimax, Iodamoeba, Balantidium, Giardia and Blastocystis), nematodes (Such as Strongyloides, Trichuris, Ascaris, Enterobius, Trichostrongylus and hookworms) and one trematode (a dicrocoeliid) were identified. For the first time, the cestode Hymenolepis was detected in orangutans. Highest prevalences were found for Strongyloides (individuals 37%; groups 58%), hookworms (41%; 58%), Balantidium (40%; 61%), Entamoeba coli (29%; 53%) and a trichostrongylid (13%; 32%). In re-introduction centres, infants were at higher risk of infection with Strongyloides than adults. Infection risk for hookworms was significantly higher in wild males compared with females. In groups, the centres themselves had a significant influence on the infection risk for Balantidium. Ranging patterns of wild orangutans, overcrowding in captivity and a shift of age composition in favour of immatures seemed to be the most likely factors leading to these results."
Ultrastructural and molecular characterization of Balantidium coli isolated in the Philippines,"['Nilles-Bije, ML', 'Rivera, WL']",PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH,10.1007/s00436-009-1673-9,JAN 2010,9,"Balantidium coli is a ciliated protozoon inhabiting the colon of swine, rodents, horses, nonhuman primates and humans. In association with disease triggered by other infectious agents, B. coli may become a pathogenic opportunist. This study describes the isolation, cultivation, morphological as well as molecular characterization of B. coli isolated from the large intestine of a pig in the Philippines. Based on scanning and transmission electron microscopy, this protozoon presents a dense ciliation in the oral structure and somatic cilia that are arranged in a more transverse field. Oral and somatic monokinetids were identified in the cortex of the organism. The presence of heterokaryotic nuclear condition is evident, and the cell body of the ciliate shows numerous mucocysts, several food vacuoles, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and contractile vacuoles. Polymerase chain reaction and phylogenetic analysis based on the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene were performed in order to compare our isolate with other previously reported B. coli isolates. The full-length sequence of the SSU rRNA gene of the isolate showed 99% similarity to other B. coli isolates reported in the GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolate clustered with previously reported B. coli isolates from gorillas, pig, and ostrich. To date, no studies on the ultrastructure and phylogeny of B. coli isolated in the Philippines have been reported. Results from this study may serve as a baseline data for further ultrastructural and phylogenetic studies on this organism. This study also suggests that morphological characteristics along with molecular identification are essential for validating and identifying species of Balantidium."
Coprophagy in wild bonobos (Pan paniscus) at Wamba in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: a possibly adaptive strategy?,"['Sakamaki, T']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-009-0167-9,JAN 2010,6,"Four cases of coprophagy and two cases of fecal inspection were identified during the 1142 h of observing wild bonobos at Wamba in the Luo Scientific Reserve in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At least 5 females in the study group practiced coprophagy and/or fecal inspection. According to our daily behavioral observations, boredom and stress, insufficient roughage, and the search for essential nutrients could not explain the coprophagy. Several episodes observed in this study indicated that bonobos might have sought and ingested certain valuable food items, such as hard Dialium seeds, in feces during relatively lean seasons. Although coprophagy occurred only rarely among wild bonobos, this practice appeared to represent a possibly adaptive feeding strategy during periods of food scarcity rather than a behavioral abnormality."

Behavioral Response of Captive Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) to the Death of Silverbacks in Multi-Male Groups,"['Less, EH', 'Lukas, KE', 'Kuhar, CW', 'Stoinski, TS']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20246,JAN-FEB 2010,2,"In both free-ranging and captive western lowland gorillas, a silverback provides protection and leadership, mediating conflict within a group. In the wild, when a dominant silverback dies the group will disperse or transfer to a solitary male., unless a subsequent male is present to inherit the group. In captivity, Studies have focused on groups containing one male and therefore it is unclear how gorillas respond to the death or removal of a silverback in multi-male groups. This study examined the behavior of a bachelor group (Cleveland Metroparks Zoo) and a multi-male, mixed-sex group (Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium) following the death of two older silverbacks in 2005. Both of the younger but dominant males maintained their same level of dominance after the death. We predicted that agonism would increase after the death as groups struggled for social stablility. We did observe an increase in both agonism and displacements among the bachelor group, but only observed an increase in displacements among the mixed-sex group. Although we predicted that there would be no change in solitary behavior, both groups decreased feeding and the mixed-sex group increased self-directed behavior post-death. In the bachelor group, self-directed behavior decreased and undesirable behavior increased. We also observed a difference in spatial distance after the death with members of the mixed-sex group becoming more dispersed and members of the bachelor group more converged. This study demonstrates that there is a period of transition for multi-male groups after the death or removal of the oldest silverback. Future research could integrate physiological measures with behavioral analyses before and after the death or removal of a prominent member of the group. Zoo Biol 29:16-29, 20 10.

This can negatively impact the visitor's visiting experience and the zoo's ability to communicate conservation and education messages. Over the past 9 years, Disney's Animal Kingdom (R) hits developed a process for monitoring and improving the visibility of animals oil display to the public. This animal visibility process utilizes a data collection system whereby systematic observations are collected each week. The percentage of observations where at least one animal was visible is recorded for each species and compared to an 80% visibility criterion. Species that do not reach this criterion for 4 consecutive weeks are discussed at animal management meetings. If the problems associated with animal visibility cannot be easily solved. the animal-care teams partner with the research team to conduct a second process, called the Visibility Issues Process. This process provides additional information for the animal-care team to utilize in developing a plan to improve visibility. Although the Processes described here are specific to the infrastructure at Disney's Animal Kingdom (R), the basic concepts of (1) a formalized visibility data collection process. (2) a visibility criterion to which managers of species are held accountable, and (3) a process for planning to improve animal visibility without negatively impacting animal welfare are fundamental concepts that can be developed it individual institutions and incorporated into that zoo's existing infrastructure.

How Ebola Impacts Genetics of Western Lowland Gorilla Populations,"['Le Gouar, PJ', 'Vallet, D', 'David, L', 'Bermejo, M', 'Gatti, S', 'Levrero, F', 'Petit, EJ', 'Menard, N']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0008375,DEC 18 2009,8,"Background: Emerging infectious diseases in wildlife are major threats for both human health and biodiversity conservation. Infectious diseases can have serious consequences for the genetic diversity of populations, which could enhance the species' extinction probability. The Ebola epizootic in western and central Africa induced more than 90% mortality in Western lowland gorilla population. Although mortality rates are very high, the impacts of Ebola on genetic diversity of Western lowland gorilla have never been assessed.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We carried out long term studies of three populations of Western lowland gorilla in the Republic of the Congo (Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Lossi gorilla sanctuary both affected by Ebola and Lossi's periphery not affected). Using 17 microsatellite loci, we compared genetic diversity and structure of the populations and estimate their effective size before and after Ebola outbreaks. Despite the effective size decline in both populations, we did not detect loss in genetic diversity after the epizootic. We revealed temporal changes in allele frequencies in the smallest population.

Conclusions/Significance: Immigration and short time elapsed since outbreaks could explain the conservation of genetic diversity after the demographic crash. Temporal changes in allele frequencies could not be explained by genetic drift or random sampling. Immigration from genetically differentiated populations and a non random mortality induced by Ebola, i.e., selective pressure and cost of sociality, are alternative hypotheses. Understanding the influence of Ebola on gorilla genetic dynamics is of paramount importance for human health, primate evolution and conservation biology."
Molecular Characterization of Pneumococcal Isolates from Pets and Laboratory Animals,"['van der Linden, M', 'Al-Lahham, A', 'Nicklas, W', 'Reinert, RR']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0008286,DEC 14 2009,6,"Background: Between 1986 and 2008 Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 41 pets/zoo animals (guinea pigs (n = 17), cats (n = 12), horses (n = 4), dogs (n = 3), dolphins (n = 2), rat (n = 2), gorilla (n = 1)) treated in medical veterinary laboratories and zoos, and 44 laboratory animals (mastomys (multimammate mice; n = 32), mice (n = 6), rats (n = 4), guinea pigs (n = 2)) during routine health monitoring in an animal facility. S. pneumoniae was isolated from nose, lung and respiratory tract, eye, ear and other sites.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Carriage of the same isolate of S. pneumoniae over a period of up to 22 weeks was shown for four mastomys. Forty-one animals showed disease symptoms. Pneumococcal isolates were characterized by optochin sensitivity, bile solubility, DNA hybridization, pneumolysin PCR, serotyping and multilocus sequence typing. Eighteen of the 32 mastomys isolates (56%) were optochin resistant, all other isolates were optochin susceptible. All mastomys isolates were serotype 14, all guinea pig isolates serotype 19F, all horse isolates serotype 3. Rats had serotypes 14 or 19A, mice 33A or 33F. Dolphins had serotype 23F, the gorilla serotype 14. Cats and dogs had many different serotypes. Four isolates were resistant to macrolides, three isolates also to clindamycin and tetracyclin. Mastomys isolates were sequence type (ST) 15 (serotype 14), an ST/serotype combination commonly found in human isolates. Cats, dogs, pet rats, gorilla and dolphins showed various human ST/serotype combinations. Lab rats and lab mice showed single locus variants (SLV) of human STs, in human ST/serotype combinations. All guinea pig isolates showed the same completely new combination of known alleles. The horse isolates showed an unknown allele combination and three new alleles.

Conclusions/Significance: The isolates found in mastomys, mice, rats, cats, dogs, gorilla and dolphins are most likely identical to human pneumococcal isolates. Isolates from guinea pigs and horses appear to be specialized clones for these animals. Our data redraw attention to the fact that pneumococci are not strictly human pathogens. Pet animals that live in close contact to humans, especially children, can be infected by human isolates and also carriage of even resistant isolates is a realistic possibility."
The Influence of Fallback Foods on Great Ape Tooth Enamel,"['Constantino, PJ', 'Lucas, PW', 'Lee, JJW', 'Lawn, BR']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21096,DEC 2009,35,"Lucas and colleagues recently proposed a model based on fracture and deformation concepts to describe how mammalian tooth enamel may be adapted to the mechanical demands of diet (Lucas et al.: Bioessays 30[2008] 374-385). Here we review the applicability of that model by examining existing data on the food mechanical properties and enamel morphology of great apes (Pan, Pongo, and Gorilla). Particular attention is paid to whether the consumption of fallback foods is likely to play a key role in influencing great ape enamel morphology. Our results suggest that this is indeed the case. We also consider the implications of this conclusion on the evolution of the dentition of extinct hominins. Am J Phys Anthropol 140:653-660, 2009. (C)2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

To better understand the selective pressures that favored the distinctive dental and locomotor morphologies of gibbons and orangutans, we examined the foraging and ranging behavior of sympatric Hylobates albibarbis and Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii during an episode of low fruit availability at Tuanan, Kalimantan Tengah, Indonesia. We found that Hylobates ranged 0.5 km day(-1) or 33% farther than did Pongo, but the overall daily ranging of both species did not vary as fruit availability decreased by as much as 50%. Among gibbons, we observed dietary switching to fallback foods; in particular, there was a progressively greater reliance on figs, liana products, and unripe fruit. Orangutans relied heavily on unripe fruit and fracture-resistant bark and pith tissues. Despite these divergent fallback patterns, the stiffness of fruit mesocarp consumed by Hylobates and Pongo did not differ. We discuss canine and molar functional morphology with respect to dietary mechanics. Next, to contextualize these results, we discuss our findings with respect to forest structure. The rain forests of Southeast Asia have been described as having open, discontinuous canopies. Such a structure may inform our understanding of the ranging behavior and distinctive locomotion of apes in the region, namely richochetal brachiation and quadrumanous clambering. Our approach of integrating behavioral ecology with physical measures of food may be a powerful tool for understanding the functional adaptations of primates. Am J Phys Anthropol 140:716-726, 2009.

Here we report results on adult male and female western gorilla foraging behavior, based on systematic focal observations and nutritional analyses of foods. We found that western gorillas, like other apes, are highly selective ripe fruit specialists, seeking fruit high in energy, low in antifeedants, and rare in the environment. During seasonal fruiting peaks, fruit accounted for up to 70% of feeding time. When ripe fruit was scarce, gorillas increased time spent feeding on leaves and nonpreferred fruits and herbs. Leaves were the major fallback food, accounting for up to 70% of feeding time in males and 50% in females during periods of fruit scarcity. In spite of large differences in body size, the sexes were remarkably similar in their overall diet, not differing in time spent feeding on fruit or preferred herbs. However, the male consistently fed more often and on a greater variety of leaves than did females, whereas females fed more often on fallback herbs and termites. Our findings, when considered in light of previous findings on sympatric mangabeys, indicate that the foraging strategy of western gorillas is broadly similar to that of chimpanzees and orangutans, and distinct from that of old world monkeys.

"Fallback Foods and Dietary Partitioning Among Pan and Gorilla
","['Yamagiwa, J', 'Basabose, AK']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21102,DEC 2009,27,"Recent findings on the strong preference of gorillas for fruits and the large dietary overlap between sympatric gorillas and chimpanzees has led to a debate over the folivorous/frugivorous dichotomy and resource partitioning. To add insight to these arguments, we analyze the diets of sympatric gorillas and chimpanzees inhabiting the montane forest of Kahuzi-Biega National Park (DRC) using a new definition of fallback foods (Marshall and Wrangham: Int J Primatol 28 [2007] 1219-1235). We determined the preferred fruits of Kahuzi chimpanzees and gorillas from direct feeding observations and fecal analyses conducted over an 8-year period. Although there was extensive overlap in the preferred fruits of these two species, gorillas tended to consume fewer fruits with prolonged availability while chimpanzees consumed fruits with large seasonal fluctuations. Fig fruit was defined as a preferred food of chimpanzees, although it may also play a role as the staple fallback food. Animal foods, such as honey bees and ants, appear to constitute filler fallback foods of chimpanzees. Tool use allows chimpanzees to obtain such high-quality fallback foods during periods of fruit scarcity Among filler fallback foods, terrestrial herbs may enable chimpanzees to live in small home ranges in the montane forest, whereas the availability of animal foods may permit them to expand their home range in and areas. Staple fallback foods including barks enable gorillas to form cohesive groups with similar home range across habitats irrespective of fruit abundance. These differences in fallback strategies seem to have shaped different social features between sympatric gorillas and chimpanzees. Am J Phys Anthropol 140:739-750, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
The Strategic Use of Sex in Wild Female Western Gorillas,"['Doran-Sheeny, DM', 'Fernandez, D', 'Borries, C']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20743,DEC 2009,8,"Human females, unlike most mammals, are sexually active outside of fertile periods. This decoupling of sexual behavior from its conceptive function has had an enormous impact on human social relationships, and yet we know little about why there was selection for nonconceptive mating. Here we examine one form of nonconceptive mating, the mating that occurs during pregnancy or post-conceptive (PC) mating, in wild western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla). Using a near complete mating record for five females during gestation, we show that pregnant females varied in the timing and frequency of mating, and used PC mating conditionally, synchronizing copulations to occur on days when other females mated, and refraining from mating for lengthy periods when no other females mated. As pregnant females mated exclusively with the same male before and after conception, and mated in response to group female (and not male) behavior, we conclude that western gorillas used PC mating as a form of female competition, and not to confuse paternity or to obtain immediate benefits from the male, as suggested earlier. The male initiated copulations preferentially with females of high rank, rather than distinguishing between pregnant and cycling females. Therefore, PC mating appears to be a strategy by which high-ranking pregnant females attempt to minimize male interest in other females, while reinforcing their own status and potentially delaying conception in others. These findings indicate that female-mating competition is more important than considered earlier, and may be a factor in the evolution of nonconceptive mating in humans. Am. J.

Population dynamics of the Bwindi mountain gorillas,"['Robbins, MM', 'Gray, M', 'Kagoda, E', 'Robbins, AM']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2009.07.010,DEC 2009,15,"Mountain gorillas are critically endangered, with just a few hundred animals remaining in each of two populations: in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in south-western Uganda and the nearby Virunga Volcanoes on the borders of Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. While the life-history and population dynamics of the Virunga gorillas have been studied extensively, comparable information from Bwindi has not been reported. Such studies are difficult to conduct because gorillas are long-lived, have delayed reproduction, and monitoring known individuals requires habituation of social groups. Bwindi has experienced lower levels of human disturbance than the Virungas, yet its gorilla population has shown little or no growth over the past 20 years, while a subpopulation of study groups in the Virungas have grown by 3-41% per year. Here we show that the lower growth rate at Bwindi may arise mainly from lower fertility than the Virunga study groups, rather than higher mortality. This difference may indicate that the more frugivorous Bwindi gorillas have a slower life-history, or that they are closer to the carrying capacity of their habitat. The study groups at Bwindi had a higher growth rate than the broader population, possibly because they receive veterinary care and better protection from poachers, but further analysis is necessary to understand the complex interactions among human disturbance, ecology, and the gorillas' population dynamics. Meanwhile, efforts to increase the Bwindi population should place emphasis on reducing human disturbances, improving our understanding of the impact of habitat quality, and ensuring that the gorillas can expand their home ranges into under-utilized areas of the park.

Visual expertise does not predict the composite effect across species: A comparison between spider (Ateles geoffroyi) and rhesus (Macaca mulatta) monkeys,"['Taubert, J', 'Parr, LA']",BRAIN AND COGNITION,10.1016/j.bandc.2009.09.002,DEC 2009,7,"Humans are subject to the composite illusion: two identical top halves of a face are perceived as ""different"" when they are presented with different bottom halves. This observation suggests that when building a mental representation of a face, the underlying system perceives the whole face, and has difficulty decomposing facial features. We adapted a behavioural task that measures the composite illusion to examine the perception of faces in two nonhuman species. Specifically we had spider (Ateles geoffroyi) and rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatto) perform a two-forced choice, match-to-sample task where only the top half of sample was relevant to the task. The results of Experiment I show that spider monkeys (N = 2) process the faces of familiar species (conspecifics and humans, but not chimpanzees, sheep, or sticks), holistically. The second experiment tested rhesus monkeys (N = 7) with the faces of humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, sheep, and sticks. Contrary to prediction, there was no evidence of a composite effect in the human (or familiar primate) condition. Instead, we present evidence of a composite illusion in the chimpanzee condition (an unfamiliar primate). Together, these experiments show that visual expertise does not predict the composite effect across the primate order. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Although humans are closely related to great apes, apolipoprotein data do not exist for bonobos (Pan paniscus), western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and the Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii). In the absence of any data, other great apes simply have been assumed to have dimeric apoA-II while other primates and most other mammals have been shown to have monomeric apoA-II. Using mass spectrometry, we have measured the molecular masses of apoA-I and apoA-II associated with the HDL of these great apes. Each was observed to have dimeric apoA-II. Being phylogenetically related, one would anticipate these apolipoproteins having a high percentage of invariant sequences when compared with human apolipoproteins. However, the orangutan, which diverged from the human lineage between 16 and 21 million years ago, had an apoA-II with the lowest monomeric mass, 8031.3 Da and the highest apoA-I value, 28,311.7 Da, currently reported for various mammals. Interestingly, the gorilla that diverged from the lineage leading to the human-chimpanzee branch after the orangutan had almost identical mass values to those reported for human apoA-I and apoA-II. But chimpanzee and the bonobo that diverged more recently had identical apoA-II mass values that were slightly larger than reported for the human apolipoprotein. The chimpanzee A-I mass values were very close to those of humans; however, the bonobo had values intermediate to the molecular masses of orangutan and the other great apes. With the already existing genomic data for chimpanzee and the recent entries for the orangutan and gorilla, we were able to demonstrate a close agreement between our mass spectral data and the calculated molecular weights determined from the predicted primary sequences of the respective apolipoproteins. Post-translational modification of these apolipoproteins, involving truncation and oxidation of methionine, are also reported. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Transvalued Species in an African Forest,"['Remis, MJ', 'Hardin, R']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01290.x,DEC 2009,12,"We combined ethnographic investigations with repeated ecological transect surveys in the Dzanga-Sangha Dense Forest Reserve (RDS), Central African Republic, to elucidate consequences of intensifying mixed use of forests. We devised a framework for transvaluation of wildlife species, which means the valuing of species on the basis of their ecological, economic, and symbolic roles in human lives. We measured responses to hunting, tourism, and conservation of two transvalued species in RDS: elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla). Our methods included collecting data on encounter rates and habitat use on line transects. We recorded cross-cultural variation in ideas about and interactions with these species during participant observation of hunting and tourism encounters and ethnographic interviews with hunters, conservation staff, researchers, and tourists. Ecologically, gorillas used human-modified landscapes successfully, and elephants were more vulnerable than gorillas to hunting. Economically, tourism and encounters with elephants and gorillas generated revenues and other benefits for local participants. Symbolically, transvaluation of species seemed to undergird competing institutions of forest management that could prove unsustainable. Nevertheless, transvaluation may also offer alternatives to existing social hierarchies, thereby integrating local and transnational support for conservation measures. The study of transvaluation requires attention to transnational flows of ideas and resources because they influence transspecies interactions. Cross-disciplinary in nature, transvalution of species addresses the political and economic challenges to conservation because it recognizes the varied human communities that shape the survival of wildlife in a given site. Transvaluation of species could foster more socially inclusive management and monitoring approaches attuned to competing economic demands, specific species behaviors, and human practices at local scales."
The road to therapeutic RNA interference (RNAi): Tackling the 800 pound siRNA delivery gorilla.,"['Meade, Bryan R', 'Dowdy, Steven F']",Discovery medicine,NA,2009-Dec,13,"If those of us privileged enough to have the opportunity to work towards curing human diseases had the power to design the ideal therapeutic molecule, the question would be what selection criteria would we choose? Arguably, at the top of the list would be four mandatory properties: specificity, potency, tolerability, and universality. So it should come as no surprise the momentum associated with the field of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced RNA Interference (RNAi) therapeutics has gained strength, as these molecules have shown exceptional promise in fulfilling all of these requirements. Unfortunately, siRNAs are too large, too charged, and too rigid to passively diffuse across the cellular membrane and thereby require a delivery system to enter cells. Thus, since its conception of working in human cells, siRNA delivery remains The 800 Pound Gorilla in the room. The main complication yet to overcome is engineering delivery systems that are safe and efficient in systemically delivering siRNA molecules to the diseased tissue and across the cellular membrane of target cells. Currently, encapsulating the siRNA in nanoparticle and liposomal systems has risen to become the standard of delivery approaches. While generally speaking these delivery platforms offer significant advancements, our laboratory is committed to generating alternative siRNA delivery technologies that avoid nanoparticle packaging and allow siRNA molecules to be delivered as single, soluble entities. This brief review discusses the first of these technologies, a Peptide Transduction Domain-dsRNA Binding Domain (PTD-DRBD) fusion protein that avidly binds to the siRNA backbone to mask the negative charge and uses the PTD for macromolecular cellular delivery."
Cross-Species Pathogen Transmission and Disease Emergence in Primates,"['Pedersen, AB', 'Davies, TJ']",ECOHEALTH,10.1007/s10393-010-0284-3,DEC 2009,23,"Many of the most virulent emerging infectious diseases in humans, e.g., AIDS and Ebola, are zoonotic, having shifted from wildlife populations. Critical questions for predicting disease emergence are: (1) what determines when and where a disease will first cross from one species to another, and (2) which factors facilitate emergence after a successful host shift. In wild primates, infectious diseases most often are shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographic region. Therefore, humans may be most vulnerable to diseases from the great apes, which include chimpanzees and gorillas, because these species represent our closest relatives. Geographic overlap may provide the opportunity for cross-species transmission, but successful infection and establishment will be determined by the biology of both the host and pathogen. We extrapolate the evolutionary relationship between pathogen sharing and divergence time between primate species to generate ""hotspot"" maps, highlighting regions where the risk of disease transfer between wild primates and from wild primates to humans is greatest. We find that central Africa and Amazonia are hotspots for cross-species transmission events between wild primates, due to a high diversity of closely related primate species. Hotspots of host shifts to humans will be most likely in the forests of central and west Africa, where humans come into frequent contact with their wild primate relatives. These areas also are likely to sustain a novel epidemic due to their rapidly growing human populations, close proximity to apes, and population centers with high density and contact rates among individuals."
A Legacy of Low-Impact Logging does not Elevate Prevalence of Potentially Pathogenic Protozoa in Free-Ranging Gorillas and Chimpanzees in the Republic of Congo: Logging and Parasitism in African Apes,"['Gillespie, TR', 'Morgan, D', 'Deutsch, JC', 'Kuhlenschmidt, MS', 'Salzer, JS', 'Cameron, K', 'Reed, T', 'Sanz, C']",ECOHEALTH,10.1007/s10393-010-0283-4,DEC 2009,11,"Many studies have examined the long-term effects of selective logging on the abundance and diversity of free-ranging primates. Logging is known to reduce the abundance of some primate species through associated hunting and the loss of food trees for frugivores; however, the potential role of pathogens in such primate population declines is largely unexplored. Selective logging results in a suite of alterations in host ecology and forest structure that may alter pathogen dynamics in resident wildlife populations. In addition, environmental pollution with human fecal material may present a risk for wildlife infections with zoonotic protozoa, such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia. To better understand this interplay, we compared patterns of infection with these potentially pathogenic protozoa in sympatric western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in the undisturbed Goualougo Triangle of Nouabal,-Ndoki National Park and the adjacent previously logged Kabo Concession in northern Republic of Congo. No Cryptosporidium infections were detected in any of the apes examined and prevalence of infection with Giardia was low (3.73% overall) and did not differ between logged and undisturbed forest for chimpanzees or gorillas. These results provide a baseline for prevalence of these protozoa in forest-dwelling African apes and suggest that low-intensity logging may not result in long-term elevated prevalence of potentially pathogenic protozoa."
Evolution of major histocompatibility complex G and C and natural killer receptors in primates,"['Parga-Lozano, C', 'Reguera, R', 'Gomez-Prieto, P', 'Arnaiz-Villena, A']",HUMAN IMMUNOLOGY,10.1016/j.humimm.2009.07.017,DEC 2009,4,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-G and -C molecules bear ligands to natural killer immunoglobulin receptors (KIR). MHC-G evolution in primates shows some anomalies. In New World monkeys MHC-G molecules show a high polymorphism and most likely are classical antigen presenters; they also cluster closer to MHC-E in a relatedness dendrogram. Their genes lack intron 2 deletion, which is typical of all other primates in regard to MHC-G. Medium-sized Eurasian-African monkeys (Cercopithecinae) show stop codons in exon 3: only MHC-G isoforms without exon 3 are possible. Big apes such as the orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee as well as human beings show limited HLA-G polymorphism. HLA-C has not been found in medium-size Eurasian-African monkeys, but we have found MHC-C DNA sequences in more evolutionary ancient New World monkeys. Taking into account that the KIR inhibitory receptors signal is dominated by MHC-C in human beings, this suggests that both MHC-C molecules and their ligands within natural killer lymphocyte KIR also exist in the Most evolutionary ancient apes (New World monkeys were present on Earth before 40 million years ago), as KIR receptors also appeared before 130 million years ago in evolution. Indeed, KIR receptor genes have recently been found in a New World monkey. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics."

"BLACK BEAUTIES, GORILLA PILLS, FOOTBALLS, AND HILLBILLY HEROIN: SOME REFLECTIONS ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE AND DIVERSION RESEARCH OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS","['Inciardi, JA', 'Cicero, TJ']",JOURNAL OF DRUG ISSUES,NA,WIN 2009,5,"Although the problem of prescription drug abuse has endured for well over two centuries, research into the abuse and diversion of these drugs has been relatively recent. The first general population survey to document the abuse of prescription medications occurred in 1970, and subsequent studies demonstrated that the abuse and diversion of amphetamines, opioids, and sedatives has continued to be widespread. During the 1980s and much of the 1990s, prescription drug abuse took a back seat to other more pressing concerns: 'freebase' and powder cocaine, the cocaine wars, crack and sex-for-crack exchanges, rising rates of drug-related street crime, and HIV/AIDS among injection and non-injection drug users, However, recent surveys suggest that the current outbreak of prescription drug abuse began during the early to mid-1990s. Although the abuse and diversion of prescription drugs was clearly an evolving problem, what seemed to galvanize the attention of the media, the government, and the public at large was OxyContin(AE). Currently, there is no question that the problems of prescription drug abuse and diversion continue to grow. Why this is so, however, is open to speculation. Perhaps the reason lies in the increasing numbers of prescription drugs that are being legally marketed. Or perhaps the popularity of prescription drugs is rooted in the beliefs that they are more acceptable, less dangerous, and less subject to legal consequences than are illicit drugs."
Testing hypotheses of dietary reconstruction from buccal dental microwear in Australopithecus afarensis,"['Estebaranz, F', 'Martinez, LM', 'Galbany, J', 'Turbon, D', 'Perez-Perez, A']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2009.07.007,DEC 2009,7,"A recent study of occlusal microwear in Australopithecus afarensis described this species as an opportunistic dweller, living in both forested and open environments and greatly relying on fallback resources and using fewer food-processing activities than previously suggested. In the present study, analysis of buccal microwear variability in a sample of A. afarensis specimens (n = 75 teeth) showed no significant correlations with the ecological shift that took place around 3.5 Ma in Africa. These results are consistent with the occlusal microwear data available. In fact, significant correlations between buccal and occlusal microwear variables were found. However, comparison of the buccal microwear patterns showed clear similarities between A. afarensis and those hominoid species living in somewhat open environments, especially the Cameroon gorillas. A diet based mainly on succulent fruits and seasonal fallback resources would be consistent with the buccal microwear patterns observed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Cryptosporidium infection in non-human hosts in Malawi,"['Banda, Z', 'Nichols, RAB', 'Grimason, AM', 'Smith, HV']",ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH,NA,DEC 2009,3,"BANDA, Z., NICHOLS, ROSELY A.B., GRIMASON, A.M. & SMITH, H.V. 2009. Cryptosporidium infection in non-human hosts in Malawi. Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research, 76:363-375

Of 1 346 faecal samples from the Chikwawa and Thyolo districts of Malawi, analysed for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts between October 2001 and May 2003, 61.3 % were from cattle (29.8 % of these were from calves <6 months old). Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected during all three seasons studied in Chikwawa and Thyolo. In Chikwawa, 13.6% of adult cattle and 11.7 % of calves were infected, compared to 28.9 % of adult cattle and 36.7 % of calves in Thyolo. Dependent on season, between 7.8% and 37.7 % (Chikwawa) and 16.7 % and 39.3 % (Thyolo) of cattle samples contained oocysts. In Chikwawa, the highest percentage of infections occurred in the cool season, whereas in Thyolo, the highest percentage of infections occurred in the dry season. Faecal samples from goats [n = 225], pigs [n = 921, sheep [n = 6]), rabbits, guinea pigs, chickens, ducks, turkeys, doves and guinea fowls were also analysed. Up to 5.6 % of goat samples contained oocysts in Chikwawa, compared to between 16.7% and 39.3% in Thyolo. Again, in Chikwawa, the highest percentage of infections occurred in the cool season and the lowest in the rainy season, whereas, in Thyolo, the highest percentage of infections occurred in the dry season and the lowest in the cool season. In pigs, more infections were detected in the dry season in Chikwawa, but infections in the cool season were similar (17.7 %), whereas in Thyolo, infections occurred in all three seasons (17.9 % in the rainy season, 25 % in the cool season and 60 % in the dry season). Of ten diarrhoeic, oocyst positive cattle faecal samples collected from Chikwawa and subjected to PCR-RFLP, four oocyst positive samples (two from heifers, one from a cow and one unknown) were amplified at an 18S rRNA and Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) loci. RFLP of the 18S rRNA locus indicated that Cryptosporidium parvum, Cryptosporidium hominis, Cryptosporidium bovis and / or Cryptosporidium ryanae DNA, or a mixture of them was present. Cryptosporidium parvum DNA was identified in one sample that amplified at the COWP locus, indicating the presence of the major zoonotic Cryptosporidium species in Malawi."
"Chimpanzee subspecies and 'robust' australopithecine holotypes, in the context of comments by Darwin","['Thackeray, JF', 'Prat, S']",SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE,NA,NOV-DEC 2009,2,"On the basis of comparative anatomy (including chimpanzees, gorillas and other primates), Darwin(1) suggested that Africa was the continent from which 'progenitors' of humankind evolved. Hominin fossils from this continent proved him correct. We present the results of morphometric analyses based on cranial data obtained from chimpanzee taxa currently recognised as distinct subspecies, namely Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, as well as Pan paniscus (bonobo). Our objective was to use a morphometric technique(2) to quantify the degree of similarity between pairs of specimens, in the context of a statistical (probabilistic) definition of a species.(3-5) Results obtained from great apes, including two subspecies of chimpanzee, were assessed in relation to same-scale comparisons between the holotypes of 'robust' australopithecine (Pilo-Pleistocene hominin) taxa which have traditionally been distinguished at a species level, notably Paranthropus robustus from South Africa, and Paranthropus (Australopithecus/Zinjanthropus) boisei from East Africa. The question arises as to whether the holotypes of these two taxa, TM 1517 from Kromdraai(6) and OH 5 from Olduvai,(7) respectively, are different at the subspecies rather than at the species level."

In this study, the gastrointestinal parasites of ursine colobus monkeys (Colobus vellerosus) at the Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary (BFMS), Ghana, were investigated. BFMS is a sacred grove where monkeys and humans have long lived in relatively peaceful proximity. Fecal samples (n = 109) were collected opportunistically from >27 adult and subadult males in six bisexual groups and one all-male band from July 2004 to August 2005. Using fecal floatation, we detected three protozoans (two Entamoeba sp., Isospora sp.), five nematodes (Ascaris sp., Enterobius sp., Trichuris sp., two strongyle sp.), and one digenean trematode. Using fluorescein labeled antibodies, we detected an additional protozoan (Giardia sp.), and with PCR techniques, we characterized this as G. duodenalis Assemblage B and also identified a protistan (Blastocystis sp., subtype 2) The most prevalent parasite species were G. duodenalis and Trichuris sp. Parasites were more prevalent in the long wet season than the long dry Parasite prevalence did not vary by age, and average parasite richness did not differ by rank for males whose status remained unchanged. However, males that changed rank tended to show higher average parasite richness when they were lower ranked. Individuals that spent more time near human settlements had a higher prevalence of Isospora sp. that morphologically resembled the human species I belli, The presence of this parasite and G. duodenalis Assemblage B indicates possible anthropozoonotic and/or zoonotic transmission between humans and colobus monkeys at this site.

Comparing dogs and great apes in their ability to visually track object transpositions,"['Rooijakkers, EF', 'Kaminski, J', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-009-0238-8,NOV 2009,21,"Knowing that objects continue to exist after disappearing from sight and tracking invisible object displacements are two basic elements of spatial cognition. The current study compares dogs and apes in an invisible transposition task. Food was hidden under one of two cups in full view of the subject. After that both cups were displaced, systematically varying two main factors, whether cups were crossed during displacement and whether the cups were substituted by the other cup or instead cups were moved to new locations. While the apes were successful in all conditions, the dogs had a strong preference to approach the location where they last saw the reward, especially if this location remained filled. In addition, dogs seem to have especial difficulties to track the reward when both containers crossed their path during displacement. These results confirm the substantial difference that exists between great apes and dogs with regard to mental representation abilities required to track the invisible displacements of objects."
Play and social dynamics in a captive herd of gelada baboons (Theropithecus gelada),"['Mancini, G', 'Palagi, E']",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,10.1016/j.beproc.2009.07.007,NOV 2009,15,"Here, we provide quantitative data concerning adult and immature play distribution in geladas discussing the results in the light of their social dynamics. Sex differences in immature play does not seem to reflect sex differences in adult role; in fact, frequency, modality (C-play and LR-play), and motivation (measured by play initiations) to play did not vary according to the different sex-class combinations. The occurrence of adult-adult play suggests that geladas are characterized by an apparent more than actual rigidity in their social relationships and this is particularly evident in females which show peculiar traits in the use of social play. Specifically, adult females played with other adult females as much as with immature ones, thus suggesting their high motivation to engage in such interactions. This adult play behavioural pattern is typical of species showing relaxed/fluid more than despotic/rigid social relationships. Such assumption is also supported by the positive correlation observed between play and affinitive behaviours (grooming and agonistic support) found within each age-category (adult females and immature subjects). This evidence, together with the lack of correlation between aggressive contacts and social play,suggests that geladas use play for social assessment purposes and/or to increase their social affiliation levels.

Further Studies on the Frequency and Length of the Glandulo-Metaplastic Esophageal Mucosa in Baboons,"['Rubio, CA', 'Dick, EJ', 'Orrego, A', 'Hubbard, GB']",IN VIVO,NA,NOV-DEC 2009,5,"Background: In previous studies, the length of the glandulo-metaplastic esophageal mucosa (GMEM) at the gastroesophageal junction was assessed in a selected group of baboons. In this study, the length of the GMEM was measured in the entire esophagus in a cohort of unselected adult baboons. Materials and Methods: In 15 female baboons, the entire esophagus was removed en bloc at autopsy, from the tongue to the angle of His. No part of the stomach was included. The length of GMEM was measured using a calibrated ocular microscale. Results: GMEM was found in 11 out of the 15 esophagi. The total length of GMEM recorded in the 11 cases was 115 nun (mean 10.5 mm, range 1-45 nun). The mean age,for animals with GMEM was 15.5 years (range 7-32 years) and for animals without GMEM was 14.0 years (range 7-20 years); the difference was non-significant (p<0.6). No significant association was found between the length of the GMEM and the age of the animals (p<0.6). Conclusion: This study Substantiates the notion that GMEM in baboons is a postnatal physiological adaptative process of the esophageal mucosa to daily regurgitation with rumination of gastric juices of low pH. The GMEM apparently progresses upwards, along the esophageal mucosa. The baboon might be an excellent animal model to study the series of histological events that take place in the distal esophagus under the influence of protracted gastroesophageal reflux."

Tested in pairs, Subjects had to exchange tokens with a partner to obtain food from the experimenter. We observed 4, 5, 264, and 328 transfers of tokens in gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and bonobos, respectively. Most gifts were indirect in gorillas. chimpanzees, and bonobos, whereas most were direct in orangutans. The analysis showed no evidence of calculated reciprocity in interactions. A main finding of the study was the high rate of repeated gifts and begging gestures recorded in orangutans. This raises the question of the meaning of pointing in great apes and their ability to understand the communicative intent of others."

We measured the capacity of nuclear protein to recognize DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and telomere length of skin fibroblasts derived from mammalian species that exhibit wide differences in longevity. Our results indicate DNA DSB recognition increases exponentially with longevity. Further, an analysis of the level of Ku80 protein in human, cow, and mouse suggests that Ku levels vary dramatically between species and these levels are strongly correlated with longevity. In contrast mean telomere length appears to decrease with increasing longevity of the species, although not significantly. These findings suggest that an enhanced ability to bind to DNA ends may be important for longevity. A number of possible roles for increased levels of Ku and DNA-PKcs are discussed.

Based on a comparison of the entire nucleotide sequence against 1,440 HBV isolates reported, HBV/J was nearest to the gibbon and orangutan genotypes (mean divergences of 10.9 and 10.7%, respectively). Based on a comparison of four open reading frames, HBV/J was closer to gibbon/orangutan genotypes than to human genotypes in the P and large S genes and closest to Australian aboriginal strains (HBV/C4) and orangutan-derived strains in the S gene, whereas it was closer to human than ape genotypes in the C gene. HBV/J shared a deletion of 33 nucleotides at the start of preS1 region with C4 and gibbon genotypes, had an S-gene sequence similar to that of C4, and expressed the ayw subtype. Efficient infection, replication, and antigen expression by HBV/J were experimentally established in two chimeric mice with the liver repopulated for human hepatocytes. The HBV DNA sequence recovered from infected mice was identical to that in the inoculum. Since HBV/J is positioned phylogenetically in between human and ape genotypes, it may help to trace the origin of HBV and merits further epidemiological surveys."

However, the intricacies of gene regulation and expression caution against the use of these extant apes in deducing the anatomical structure of the last common ancestor that we shared with them. Evidence for this structure must therefore be sought from the fossil record. Until now, that record has provided few relevant data because available fossils were too recent or too incomplete. Evidence from Ardipithecus ramidus now suggests that the last common ancestor lacked the hand, foot, pelvic, vertebral, and limb structures and proportions specialized for suspension, vertical climbing, and knuckle-walking among extant African apes. If this hypothesis is correct, each extant African ape genus must have independently acquired these specializations from more generalized ancestors who still practiced careful arboreal climbing and bridging. African apes and hominids acquired advanced orthogrady in parallel. Hominoid spinal invagination is an embryogenetic mechanism that reoriented the shoulder girdle more laterally. It was unaccompanied by substantial lumbar spine abbreviation, an adaptation restricted to vertical climbing and/ or suspension. The specialized locomotor anatomies and behaviors of chimpanzees and gorillas therefore constitute poor models for the origin and evolution of human bipedality."

Beyond Gorilla and Pongo: Alternative Models for Evaluating Variation and Sexual Dimorphism in Fossil Hominoid Samples,"['Scott, JE', 'Schrein, CM', 'Kelley, J', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21059,OCT 2009,4,"Sexual size dimorphism in the postcanine dentition of the late Miocene hominoid Lufengpithecus lufengensis exceeds that in Pongo pygmaeus, demonstrating that the maximum degree of molar size dimorphism in apes is not represented among the extant Hominoidea. It has not been established, however, that the molars of Pongo are more dimorphic than those of any other living primate. In this study, we used resampling-based methods to compare molar dimorphism in Gorilla, Pongo, and Lufengpithecus to that in the papionin Mandrillus leucophaeus to test two hypotheses: (1) Pongo possesses the most size-dimorphic molars among living primates and (2) molar size dimorphism in Lufengpithecus is greater than that in the most dimorphic living primates. Our results show that M. leucophaeus exceeds great apes in its overall level of dimorphism and that L. lufengensis is more dimorphic than the extant species. Using these samples, we also evaluated molar dimorphism and taxonomic composition in two other Miocene ape samples-Ouranopithecus macedoniensis from Greece, specimens of which can be sexed based on associated canines and P(3)s, and the Sivapithecus sample from Haritalyangar, India. Ouranopithecus is more dimorphic than the extant taxa but is similar to Lufengpithecus, demonstrating that the level of molar dimorphism required for the Greek fossil sample under the single-species taxonomy is not unprecedented when the comparative framework is expanded to include extinct primates. In contrast, the Haritalyangar Siuapithecus sample, if it represents a single species, exhibits substantially greater molar dimorphism than does Lufengpithecus. Given these results, the taxonomic status of this sample remains equivocal. Am J Phys Anthropol 140:253-264, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Postconflict third-party affiliation in Canis lupus: do wolves share similarities with the great apes?,"['Palagi, E', 'Cordoni, G']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.07.017,OCT 2009,26,"Unsolicited third-party affiliation is defined as the first postconflict affinitive contact directed by bystanders to victims. To date, it has been found in apes and children but not in monkeys. We investigated the occurrence of unsolicited postconflict third-party affiliation in wolves, Canis lupus, and verified some functional hypotheses using a comparison with solicited contacts. Unsolicited affiliations were more frequent between individuals sharing good relationships and were reciprocated between partners (victims and third parties), thus suggesting the reciprocal nature of this mechanism (mutualistic behaviour). At an immediate level, in wolves unsolicited contacts provided benefits to the victim by breaking off aggression and restoring victims' social cohesiveness. The incidence of unsolicited interactions was affected by the presence of previous reconciliation. This result mirrors what has been found for the great apes, in which consolation may function as a partial alternative to reconciliation. Even though the cognitive skills at the basis of conflict resolution in canids still have to be investigated in detail, our study shows an unexpected similarity between wolves and the great apes.

Space use as an indicator of enclosure appropriateness: A novel measure of captive animal welfare,"['Ross, SR', 'Schapiro, SJ', 'Hau, J', 'Lukas, KE']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2009.08.007,OCT 2009,14,"Empirical measures of animal behavior and space use within the captive environment can provide critical information about animals' requirements, preferences and internal states. The trend toward naturalistic environments has shown promise in terms of behavioral benefits for animals such as great apes, and there have been several studies of the effects of complex environments on captive apes. However, few recent investigations have objectively compared environmental preferences between two distinct enclosures. In this study, we assessed how ape space use varied within and across two very different environments: an indoor, hardscape enclosure and an indoor/outdoor, naturalistic enclosure. Within-facility tests were conducted by comparing data from behavioral observations of the apes' position in the enclosures to measurements of the space and the availability of individual environmental elements. Between-facility comparisons utilized electivity index calculations to assess both the degree of use for specific features and the degree to which these selections strengthened or weakened in the new facility. Both gorillas and chimpanzees showed significant structural preferences in the older, hardscape environment: positioning themselves by mesh barriers (chimpanzees: P = 0.005; gorillas: P < 0.001) and corners (P = 0.005; gorillas: P < 0.001) more than would be expected by random spatial utilization, and avoiding open spaces (chimpanzees: P = 0.005; gorillas: P < 0.001) not adjacent to any physical structure. A new, naturalistic enclosure was constructed using preference data from the previous facility. In the new facility, both species of ape substantially altered the way in which they chose to position themselves in the enclosure. Chimpanzees used most of the environmental elements at rates more similar to the proportions they were available. While gorilla's preference corners was maintained in the new facility, preferences for doorways and mesh barriers disappeared. Comparing electivity indices facilitated an empirical comparison of space use preferences. Chimpanzees showed significant differences in how they used structural elements (P = 0.021), mesh barriers (P = 0.009) and corners (P = 0.016) in the new facility. Gorillas' environmental selections were similarly altered in the new facility, as selections of areas adjacent to doorways (P = 0.003). glass barriers (P = 0.005), structural elements (P < 0.001), and mesh barriers (P = 0.012) were all significantly affected by the transfer. This approach is useful for understanding how captive animals utilize their enclosures and we advocate that electivity indices can be added to a growing list of tools to assess the effect of captive environments on animal welfare.

Logging Concessions Can Extend the Conservation Estate for Central African Tropical Forests,"['Clark, CJ', 'Poulsen, JR', 'Malonga, R', 'Elkan, PW']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01243.x,OCT 2009,57,"The management of tropical forest in timber concessions has been proposed as a solution to prevent further biodiversity loss. The effectiveness of this strategy will likely depend on species-specific, population-level responses to logging. We conducted a survey (749 line transects over 3450 km) in logging concessions (1.2 million ha) in the northern Republic of Congo to examine the impact of logging on large mammal populations, including endangered species such as the elephant (Loxodonta africana), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), and bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus). When we estimated species abundance without consideration of transect characteristics, species abundances in logged and unlogged forests were not different for most species. When we modeled the data with a hurdle model approach, however, analyzing species presence and conditional abundance separately with generalized additive models and then combining them to calculate the mean species abundance, species abundance varied strongly depending on transect characteristics. The mean species abundance was often related to the distance to unlogged forest, which suggests that intact forest serves as source habitat for several species. The mean species abundance responded nonlinearly to logging history, changing over 30 years as the forest recovered from logging. Finally the distance away from roads, natural forest clearings, and villages also determined the abundance of mammals. Our results suggest that logged forest can extend the conservation estate for many of Central Africa's most threatened species if managed appropriately. In addition to limiting hunting, logging concessions must be large, contain patches of unlogged forest, and include forest with different logging histories."
Recent de novo origin of human protein-coding genes,"['Knowles, DG', 'McLysaght, A']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.095026.109,OCT 2009,112,"The origin of new genes is extremely important to evolutionary innovation. Most new genes arise from existing genes through duplication or recombination. The origin of new genes from noncoding DNA is extremely rare, and very few eukaryotic examples are known. We present evidence for the de novo origin of at least three human protein-coding genes since the divergence with chimp. Each of these genes has no protein-coding homologs in any other genome, but is supported by evidence from expression and, importantly, proteomics data. The absence of these genes in chimp and macaque cannot be explained by sequencing gaps or annotation error. High-quality sequence data indicate that these loci are noncoding DNA in other primates. Furthermore, chimp, gorilla, gibbon, and macaque share the same disabling sequence difference, supporting the inference that the ancestral sequence was noncoding over the alternative possibility of parallel gene inactivation in multiple primate lineages. The genes are not well characterized, but interestingly, one of them was first identified as an up-regulated gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This is the first evidence for entirely novel human-specific protein-coding genes originating from ancestrally noncoding sequences. We estimate that 0.075% of human genes may have originated through this mechanism leading to a total expectation of 18 such cases in a genome of 24,000 protein-coding genes."

Orthograde primates are characterized by a dorsal position of the scapula and a more lateral orientation of the glenoid cavity. This anatomic pattern, together with adaptations in related osteological structures and muscles, serves to facilitate the elevation of the upper extremity in the scapular plane. We quantified the proportions of the muscles comprising the principal functional and stabilizing components of the glenohumeral joint -deltoid, subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor- in 3 species of orthograde primates: Pongo pygmaeus, Pan troglodytes, and Homo sapiens. Our objective was to determine whether quantifiable differences in these muscles relate to the functional requirements of the types of locomotion used by these 3 species: suspension/vertical climbing, knuckle-walking, and bipedalism. We observed a close similarity between the proportional mass of these muscles in Homo sapiens and Pongo pygmaeus, whereas Pan troglodytes displayed a unique anatomic pattern, particularly in the subscapularis, which may be due to differences in how the glenohumeral joint is stabilized in a great ape knuckle-walker. Our findings may help explain the high incidence of subacromial impingement syndrome in humans."
Rapid Assessment of the Nutritional Value of Foods Eaten by Mountain Gorillas: Applying Near-Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy to Primatology,"['Rothman, JM', 'Chapman, CA', 'Hansen, JL', 'Cherney, DJR', 'Pell, AN']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-009-9372-z,OCT 2009,15,"The increasing recognition of the considerable intraspecific spatial and temporal variability in the nutritional contents of primate foods has necessitated development of fast and cost-effective analytical methods. Used widely for agricultural products, near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) is a quick, inexpensive means of assessing nutritional chemistry. The general principle of NIRS is that when the sample is irradiated with near-infrared light, the reflectance spectrum is characteristic of the mixture of chemical bonds present in the sample. These spectra, when calibrated against reference values-determined via traditional nutritional analysis-to develop regression equations, can be used to estimate nutritional values of similar samples without doing traditional nutritional analysis. We validated the use of NIRS for estimating the nutritional attributes of African herbs and trees, which were foods eaten by mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) collected as part of a larger study on gorilla nutritional ecology. We determined the near-infrared spectra (1100-2400 nm) of 241 dried samples of 13 species of tropical herbs and trees that formed the staple diet of the gorillas. We used modified partial least-squares regression to develop calibration equations that could predict nutritional attributes of gorilla foods, and we performed an independent validation of the calibrations. The equations had robust predictive power similar to those used in agricultural and ecology, and we found no differences between samples measured via NIRS and traditional nutritional analysis. Our analysis indicates that NIRS offers a rapid and cost-effective means of analysis of tropical leaves and herbs, and has the potential to transform primate feeding ecology studies by allowing us to evaluate the importance of intraspecific variation in nutritional value."
Evolution of the second orangutan: phylogeny and biogeography of hominid origins,"['Grehan, JR', 'Schwartz, JH', 'NORTHERN TIBETAN PLATEAU']",JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2009.02141.x,OCT 2009,21,"Aim

To resolve the phylogeny of humans and their fossil relatives (collectively, hominids), orangutans (Pongo) and various Miocene great apes and to present a biogeographical model for their differentiation in space and time.

Location

Africa, northern Mediterranean, Asia.

Methods

Maximum parsimony analysis was used to assess phylogenetic relationships among living large-bodied hominoids (= humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans), and various related African, Asian and European ape fossils. Biogeographical characteristics were analysed for vicariant replacement, main massings and nodes. A geomorphological correlation was identified for a clade we refer to as the 'dental hominoids', and this correlation was used to reconstruct their historical geography.

Results

Our analyses support the following hypotheses: (1) the living large-bodied hominoids represent a monophyletic group comprising two sister clades: humans + orangutans, and chimpanzees (including bonobos) + gorillas (collectively, the African apes); and (2) the human-orangutan clade (dental hominoids) includes fossil hominids (Homo, australopiths, Orrorin) and the Miocene-age apes Hispanopithecus, Ouranopithecus, Ankarapithecus, Sivapithecus, Lufengpithecus, Khoratpithecus and Gigantopithecus (also Plio-Pleistocene of eastern Asia). We also demonstrate that the distributions of living and fossil genera are largely vicariant, with nodes of geographical overlap or proximity between Gigantopithecus and Sivapithecus in Central Asia, and between Pongo, Gigantopithecus, Lufengpithecus and Khoratpithecus in East Asia. The main massing is represented by five genera and eight species in East Asia. The dental hominoid track is spatially correlated with the East African Rift System (EARS) and the Tethys Orogenic Collage (TOC).

Main conclusions

Humans and orangutans share a common ancestor that excludes the extant African apes. Molecular analyses are compromised by phenetic procedures such as alignment and are probably based on primitive retentions. We infer that the human-orangutan common ancestor had established a widespread distribution by at least 13 Ma. Vicariant differentiation resulted in the ancestors of hominids in East Africa and various primarily Miocene apes distributed between Spain and Southeast Asia (and possibly also parts of East Africa). The geographical disjunction between early hominids and Asian Pongo is attributed to local extinctions between Europe and Central Asia. The EARS and TOC correlations suggest that these geomorphological features mediated establishment of the ancestral range."
Multiple Sequence Alignment Algorithm Based on a Dispersion Graph and Ant Colony Algorithm,"['Chen, WY', 'Liao, B', 'Zhu, W', 'Xiang, XY']",JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY,10.1002/jcc.21203,OCT 2009,7,"In this article, we describe a representation for the processes Of multiple sequences alignment (MSA) and used it to solve the problem of MSA.

On the basis of the proposed multidimensional graph, we used the ant colony algorithm to find the better path that denotes a better aligning result. In our article, we proposed the instance of three-dimensional graph and four-dimensional graph and advanced a special ichnographic representation to analyze MSA.

Novel cytomegaloviruses in free-ranging and captive great apes: phylogenetic evidence for bidirectional horizontal transmission,"['Leendertz, FH', 'Deckers, M', 'Schempp, W', 'Lankester, F', 'Boesch, C', 'Mugisha, L', 'Dolan, A', 'Gatherer, D', 'McGeoch, DI', 'Ehlers, B']",JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY,10.1099/vir.0.011866-0,OCT 2009,17,"Wild great apes often suffer from diseases of unknown aetiology. This is among the causes of population declines. Because human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an important pathogen, especially in immunocompromised individuals, a search for cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) in deceased wild and captive chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans was performed. By using a degenerate PCR targeting four conserved genes (UL54-UL57), several distinct, previously unrecognized CMVs were found for each species. Sequences of up to 9 kb were determined for ten novel CMVs, located in the UL54-UL57 block. A phylogenetic tree was inferred for the ten novel CMVs, the previously characterized chimpanzee CMV, HCMV strains and Old World and New World monkey CMVs. The primate CMVs fell into four clades, containing New World monkey, Old World monkey, orang-utan and human CMVs, respectively, plus two clades that each contained both chimpanzee and gorilla isolates (termed CG1 and CG2). The tree loci of the first four clades mirrored those for their respective hosts in the primate tree, suggesting that these CMV lineages arose through cospeciation with host lineages. The CG1 and CG2 loci corresponded to those of the gorilla and chimpanzee hosts, respectively. This was interpreted as indicating that CG1 and CG2 represented CMV lineages that had arisen cospeciationally with the gorilla and chimpanzee lineages, respectively, with subsequent transfer within each clade between the host genera. Divergence dates were estimated and found to be consistent with overall cospeciational development of major primate CMV lineages. However, CMV transmission between chimpanzees and gorillas in both directions has also occurred."
The prehistory of handedness: Archaeological data and comparative ethology,"['Uomini, NT']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2009.02.012,OCT 2009,58,"Homo sapiens sapiens displays a species wide lateralised hand preference, with 85% of individuals in all populations being right-handed for most manual actions. In contrast, no other great ape species shows such strong and consistent population level biases, indicating that extremes of both direction and strength of manual laterality (i.e., species-wide right-handedness) may have emerged after divergence from the last common ancestor. To reconstruct the hand use patterns of early hominins, laterality is assessed in prehistoric artefacts. Group right side biases are well established from the Neanderthals onward, while patchy evidence from older fossils and artefacts indicates a preponderance of right-handed individuals. Individual hand preferences and group level biases can occur in chimpanzees and other apes for skilled tool use and food processing. Comparing these findings with human ethological data on spontaneous hand use reveals that the great ape clade (including humans) probably has a common effect at the individual level, such that a person can vary from ambidextrous to completely lateralised depending on the action. However, there is currently no theoretical model to explain this result. The degree of task complexity and bimanual complementarity have been proposed as factors affecting lateralisation strength. When primatology meets palaeoanthropology, the evidence suggests species-level right-handedness may have emerged through the social transmission of increasingly complex, bimanually differentiated, tool using activities.

Mitochondrial Insertions into Primate Nuclear Genomes Suggest the Use of numts as a Tool for Phylogeny,"['Hazkani-Covo, E']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msp131,OCT 2009,22,"Homoplasy-free characters are a valuable and highly desired tool for molecular systematics. Nuclear sequences of mitochondrial origin (numts) are fragments of mitochondrial DNA that have been transferred into the nuclear genome. numts are passively captured into genomes and have no transposition activity, Which Suggests they may have utility as phylogenetic markers. Here, five fully sequenced primate genomes (human, chimpanzee, orangutan, rhesus macaque, and marmoset) are used to reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of recent numt accumulation in a phylogenetic context. The status of 367 numt loci is used as categorical data, and a maximum parsimony approach is used to trace numt insertions on different branches of the taxonomically undisputed primate phylogenetic tree. The presence of a given numt ill related taxa implies orthologous integration, whereas the absence of a numt indicates the plesiomorphic condition prior to integration. An average rate of 5.65 numts per 1 My is estimated on the tree, but insertion rates vary significantly oil different branches. Two instances in which the presence-absence pattern Of Minus does not agree with the phylogenetic tree were identified. These events may be the result of either lineage sorting or reversal. Using the numts reported here to reconstruct primate phylogeny produces the canonical primate tree topology with high bootstrap support. Moreover, numts identified in gorilla Supercontigs were used to test the human-chimp-gorilla trichotomy, yielding a high level of support for the sister relationship of human and chimpanzee. These analyses suggest that numts are valuable phylogenetic markers that call be used for molecular systematics. It remains to be tested whether numts are useful at deeper phylogenetic levels."
"Infanticide and social flexibility in the genus Gorilla
","['Yamagiwa, J', 'Kahekwa, J', 'Basabose, AK']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-009-0163-0,OCT 2009,11,"Based on the cases of infanticide by male mountain gorillas reported from the Virunga volcanic region, the socioecological and life history features of gorillas satisfy the conditions for which infanticide may be expected. However, there are considerable variations in the occurrence of infanticide between habitats. We analyze the recent reports of infanticides that were directly observed or are suspected based on field evidence in two populations of eastern and western lowland gorillas (Kahuzi and Mbeli Bai, respectively) along with previous reports on mountain gorillas, and consider which social features are linked with and which factors influence the occurrence of infanticide in the gorilla populations. All victims were suckling infants and most of them were killed by males who seemed unrelated to them. Dependent infants are most vulnerable to infanticide when the protector male (its putative father in most cases) is absent, and so male protection ability seems to be important in determining female transfer decisions. Two cases observed in Kahuzi suggest that the infanticidal male may discriminate between infants to accept and those to kill according to his previous interactions with their mothers. Mating for a prolonged period prior to parturition is necessary for immigrant females to avoid infanticide by the new male of the group that they join. Infanticide was usually associated with female transfer, and the patterns of female association at transfer may shape variations in social structure between populations. Female mountain gorillas prefer large groups with multiple males and tend to transfer alone in order to seek more protection against infanticide in Virunga. By contrast, female eastern and western lowland gorillas tend to transfer with other females to small groups or solitary males, and maturing silverbacks take females to establish new groups through group fission in Kahuzi and Mbeli Bai. These differences may result in more multi-male and larger groups in the Virungas than in Kahuzi and Mbeli Bai. Rapid changes in density of gorilla social units and their relations following drastic environmental changes caused by recent human disturbances may also increase the probability of infanticide."
The Bushmeat Trade: Increased Opportunities for Transmission of Zoonotic Disease,"['Karesh, WB', 'Noble, E']",MOUNT SINAI JOURNAL OF MEDICINE,10.1002/msj.20139,SEP-OCT 2009,11,"Bushmeat is a term that refers to the use of wild animals, ranging from cane rats to gorillas, for food.

The bushmeat trade is an example of an anthropogenic factor that provides opportunities for the transmission of diseases from wildlife to humans. The expansion of the bushmeat trade over the past 2 decades has provided a venue for the emergence of zoonotic diseases by providing an increased opportunity for the transmission of organisms known to cause disease and organisms with an unknown impact on humans. Because the bushmeat trade is embedded in a complex cultural, political, and economic context, efforts to prevent the emergence of zoonoses require a multidisciplinary approach.

Doubts about complex speciation between humans and chimpanzees,"['Presgraves, DC', 'Yi, SV']",TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.tree.2009.04.007,OCT 2009,24,"Two patterns from large-scale DNA sequence data have been put forward as evidence that speciation between humans and chimpanzees was complex, involving hybridization and strong selection. First, divergence between humans and chimpanzees varies considerably across the autosomes. Second, divergence between humans and chimpanzees (but not gorillas) is markedly lower on the X chromosome. Here, we describe how simple speciation and neutral molecular evolution explain both patterns. In particular, the wide range in autosomal divergence is consistent with stochastic variation in coalescence times in the ancestral population; and the lower human-chimpanzee divergence on the X chromosome is consistent with species differences in the strength of male-biased mutation caused by differences in mating system. We also highlight two further patterns of divergence that are problematic for the complex speciation model. Our conclusions raise doubts about complex speciation between humans and chimpanzees."

As such, examining non-coding regions is important for understanding tyrosine hydroxylase function in human health and disease. We examined similar to 2 kb upstream of the translation start site within humans and non-human primates to obtain a fine resolution map of evolutionarily and functionally relevant cis-regulatory differences. our study investigated Macaca mulatta, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and Homo sapiens haplotypes using transient dual-luciferase transfection in three neuroblastoma cell lines to assay the impact of naturally occurring sequence variation on expression level. In addition to trans effects between cell lines, there are several significant expression differences between primate species, but the most striking difference was seen between human haplotypes in one cell line. Underlying this variation are numerous sequence polymorphisms, two of which influence expression within humans in a non-additive and cell line-specific manner. This study highlights functional consequences of tyrosine hydroxylase genetic variation in primates. Additionally, the results emphasize the importance of examining more than one cell line, the existence of multiple functional variants in a given promoter region and the presence of non-additive cis-interactions.

Among these, morphometric quantitative techniques for reconstruction are increasingly common. Here we compare the accuracy of three approaches-mean substitution, thin plate splines, and multiple linear regression-for estimating missing landmarks of damaged fossil specimens. Comparisons are made varying the number of missing landmarks, sample sizes, and the reference species of the population used to perform the estimation. The testing is performed on landmark data from individuals of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla, and nine hominin fossil specimens. Results suggest that when a small, same-species fossil reference sample is available to guide reconstructions, thin plate spline approaches perform best. However, if no such sample is available (or if the species of the damaged individual is uncertain), estimates of missing morphology based on a single individual (or even a small sample) of close taxonomic affinity are less accurate than those based on a large sample of individuals drawn from more distantly related extant populations using a technique (such as a regression method) able to leverage the information (e.g., variation/covariation patterning) contained in this large sample. Thin plate splines also show an unexpectedly large amount of error in estimating landmarks, especially over large areas. Recommendations are made for estimating missing landmarks under various scenarios. Am J Phys Anthropol 140:1-18, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Localization precision varies with the sound frequencies. As recency of common ancestry with human beings increases, primates have improved low-frequency sensitivity and reduced sensitivity to higher frequencies. The medial part of the MNTB is devoted to higher frequency processing. Thus, its high-frequency-dependent function is nearly lost in humans and its role in binaural processing as part of the contralateral pathway to the LSO remains questionable. Here, Nissl-stained sections of the superior olivary complex of man (Homo sapiens), bonobo (Pan paniscus), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), gibbon (Hylobates lar), and macaque (Macaca fascicularis) were compared to reveal differences and coincidences. From chimpanzees to humans, the size of the LSO decreased, and the MNTB as a compact nucleus nearly disappears. From chimpanzees to humans, the LSO/MNTB ratio increases dramatically too, whereas the LSO/MSO ratio remains 1.1; a finding that probably corresponds to the phylogenetic proximity between the species."

Our Lens test involved a basic component adapted from standard procedures for children, as well as several components designed to rule out alternative explanations. There were large individual differences in performance, with some chimpanzees' responses suggesting they appreciated the appearance-reality distinction.

The amount of ILS depends on population parameters such as the ancestral effective population sizes and the recombination rate, but also on the number of generations between speciation events. We rise a hidden Markov model parameterized according to coalescent theory to infer the genealogy along a four species genome alignment of closely related species and estimate population parameters. We analyze a basic, panmictic demographic model and study its properties using an extensive set of coalescent simulations. We assess the effect of the model assumptions and demonstrate that the Markov property provides a good approximation to the ancestral recombination graph. Using a too restricted set of possible genealogies, necessary to reduce the computational load, can bias parameter estimates. We propose a simple correction for this bias and suggest directions for future extensions of the model. We show that the patterns of ILS along a sequence alignment can be recovered efficiently together with the ancestral recombination rate. Finally, we introduce an extension of the basic model that. allows for mutation rate heterogeneity and reanalyze human-chimpanzee-gorilla-orangutan alignments, using the new models. We expect that this framework will prove useful for population genomics and provide exciting insights into genome evolution."
Body size and its consequences: Allometry and the lower limb length of Liang Bua 1 (Homo floresiensis),"['Holliday, TW', 'Franciscus, RG', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2009.04.007,SEP 2009,11,"Bivariate femoral length allometry in recent humans, Pan, and Gorilla is investigated with special reference to the diminutive Liang Bua (LB) 1 specimen (the holotype of Homo floresiensis) and six early Pleistocene femora referred to the genus Homo. Relative to predicted body mass, Pan and Gorilla femora show strong negative length allometry while recent human femora evince isometry to positive allometry, depending on sample composition and line-fitting technique employed. The allometric trajectories of Pan and Homo show convergence near the small body size range of LB 1, such that LB 1 manifests a low percentage deviation (d(yx) of Smith [1980]) from the Pan allometric trajectory and falls well within the 95% confidence limits around the Pan individuals (but also outside the 95% confidence limits for recent Homo). In contrast, the six early Pleistocene Homo femora, belonging to larger individuals. show much greater d(yx) values from both Pan and Gorilla and fall well above the 95% confidence limits for these taxa. All but one of these Pleistocene Homo specimens falls within the 95% confidence limits of the recent human sample. Similar results are obtained when femoral length is regressed on femoral head diameter in unlogged bivariate space. Regardless of the ultimate taxonomic status of LB 1, these findings are consistent with a prediction made by us (Franciscus and Holliday, 1992) that hominins in the small body size range of A.L. 288-1 (""Lucy""), including members of the genus Homo, will tend to possess short, apelike lower limbs as a function of body size scaling.

Why do humans have such a prominent nose? The final result of phylogenesis: A significant reduction of the splanchocranium on account of the neurocranium,"['Mladina, R', 'Skitarelic, N', 'Vukovic, K']",MEDICAL HYPOTHESES,10.1016/j.mehy.2009.03.045,SEP 2009,4,"During the last few decades several authors tried to clarify the anthropological aspects of the shape of the human nose and why it has so emphasized projection. Our hypothesis suggests the essentiality of the role of morphologic changes of the human skull which occurred during the phylogenesis. It seems that erectile posture of the man caused remarkable morphological changes of the skull base shape thus being a part of morphologic evolution. The changes in the shape of the human spine from birth to adulthood show a philogenesis in short: a newborn has an almost flat spine like quadrupeds (except in the sacrococcigeal region), but the spine gets increasingly bent as the person grows (lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, cervical lordosis). It is well known that the sphenoidal angle was less emphasized in prehistoric man than in modern man. In addition, the cervical spine position in the gorilla, Neanderthal man and modern man is quite different in terms of anterior inclination. Accordingly, there is a great degree of maxillary and mandible reduction in humans. The same differences can be seen when comparing the skull shapes of gorilla, gibbons, Neanderthals and modem man. A major reason for the maxillary and mandible reduction in humans is that their way of feeding has changed remarkably with time. In lower primates and other animals, nasal function, particularly olfaction, may be essential for day-to day survival. In humans, however, this is less important although both impaired nasal breathing and olfaction may affect the function in the other body organs and, of course, influence the quality of life. Nasal configuration in recent humans seems to be associated with the internal nasal cavity wideness and nasal bridge elevation which just happened because of newly developed physiological needs.

The skull base angulation leads directly to obvious changes in splanchocranium on the account of neurocranium, since previous is getting ""squeezed"", by angulation of the surrounding bones, and the other one gets more room for the further development according to human's intellectual needs.

The final morphologic result of the squeezing of the splanchocranium, in fact a side-effect of these phylogenetic changes, is a protrusion of its most anterior parts more anteriorly, that is a prominent nose in humans which is a hallmark of the modern man.

The Significant but Understudied Impact of Pathogen Transmission from Humans to Animals,"['Epstein, JH', 'Price, JT', 'RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS']",MOUNT SINAI JOURNAL OF MEDICINE,10.1002/msj.20140,SEP-OCT 2009,12,"Zooanthroponotic pathogens, which are transmitted from humans to nonhuman animals, are an Understudied aspect of global health, despite their potential to cause significant disease burden in wild and domestic animal Populations and affect global economies. Some key human-borne pathogens that have been shown to infect animals and cause morbidity and mortality include measles virus (paramyx-oviruses), influenza A virus (orthomyxoviruses), herpes simplex 1 virus (hypersviruses), protozoal and helminthic parasites, and bacteria Such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium. tuberculosis. However, zooanthroponotic pathogens are most commonly reported in captive animals or domestic livestock with close human contact; there, the potential for economic loss and human reinfection is most apparent. There is also the potential for infection in wild animal populations, which may threaten endangered species and decrease biodiversity. The emergence and reemergence of human-born pathogens in wildlife may also have negative consequences for human health if these pathogens cycle back into humans. Many of the anthropogenic drivers of zoonotic disease emergence also facilitate zooanthroponotic transmission. Increasing research to better understand the occurrence of and the potential for bidirectional pathogen transmission between humans and animals is essential for improving global health.

Ratcheting up the ratchet: on the evolution of cumulative culture,"['Tennie, C', 'Call, J', 'Tomasello, M']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2009.0052,AUG 27 2009,160,"Some researchers have claimed that chimpanzee and human culture rest on homologous cognitive and learning mechanisms. While clearly there are some homologous mechanisms, we argue here that there are some different mechanisms at work as well. Chimpanzee cultural traditions represent behavioural biases of different populations, all within the species' existing cognitive repertoire (what we call the 'zone of latent solutions') that are generated by founder effects, individual learning and mostly product-oriented (rather than process-oriented) copying. Human culture, in contrast, has the distinctive characteristic that it accumulates modifications over time (what we call the 'ratchet effect'). This difference results from the facts that (i) human social learning is more oriented towards process than product and (ii) unique forms of human cooperation lead to active teaching, social motivations for conformity and normative sanctions against non-conformity. Together, these unique processes of social learning and cooperation lead to humans' unique form of cumulative cultural evolution."
Independent evolution of knuckle-walking in African apes shows that humans did not evolve from a knuckle-walking ancestor,"['Kivell, TL', 'Schmitt, D']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0901280106,AUG 25 2009,42,"Despite decades of debate, it remains unclear whether human bipedalism evolved from a terrestrial knuckle-walking ancestor or from a more generalized, arboreal ape ancestor. Proponents of the knuckle-walking hypothesis focused on the wrist and hand to find morphological evidence of this behavior in the human fossil record. These studies, however, have not examined variation or development of purported knuckle-walking features in apes or other primates, data that are critical to resolution of this long-standing debate. Here we present novel data on the frequency and development of putative knuckle-walking features of the wrist in apes and monkeys. We use these data to test the hypothesis that all knuckle-walking apes share similar anatomical features and that these features can be used to reliably infer locomotor behavior in our extinct ancestors. Contrary to previous expectations, features long-assumed to indicate knuckle-walking behavior are not found in all African apes, show different developmental patterns across species, and are found in nonknuckle-walking primates as well. However, variation among African ape wrist morphology can be clearly explained if we accept the likely independent evolution of 2 fundamentally different biomechanical modes of knuckle-walking: an extended wrist posture in an arboreal environment (Pan) versus a neutral, columnar hand posture in a terrestrial environment (Gorilla). The presence of purported knuckle-walking features in the hominin wrist can thus be viewed as evidence of arboreality, not terrestriality, and provide evidence that human bipedalism evolved from a more arboreal ancestor occupying the ecological niche common to all living apes."

Patterns of autosomal divergence between the human and chimpanzee genomes support an allopatric model of speciation,"['Webster, MT']",GENE,10.1016/j.gene.2009.05.006,AUG 15 2009,6,"There is a large variation in divergence times across genomic regions between human and chimpanzee. It has been suggested that this could partly result from selection against ancestral gene flow between incipient species in regions of the genome containing genetic incompatibilities. It is possible that such barriers to gene flow could arise in specific genes or in chromosomal inversions. I analysed patterns of lineage sorting that occur between human, chimpanzee and gorilla genomic sequences by examining divergent site patterns in >18 Mb genomic alignments. I develop a method to normalise site patterns by the mutational spectrum to minimise errors caused by misinference caused by recurrent mutation. Here I show that divergence times appear to be uniform between coding and noncoding sequences and between inverted and non-rearranged portions of chromosomes. I therefore find no evidence to support the large-scale accumulation of genetic incompatibilities at speciation genes or chromosomal inversions in the ancestral population of humans and chimpanzees. In addition, site patterns that are discordant with the species tree occur more frequently in regions with high human recombination rates. This could indicate the action of selective sweeps in the ancestral population, but could also be indicative of increased rates of homoplasy in these regions. I argue that these observations are compatible with a neutral allopatric model of speciation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Consequent increases in resource competition including crop-raiding are a by-product of both natural resources becoming less available and the nutritional benefits of cultivated foods becoming more known to the nonhuman primates. Chimpanzees at Bossou in the Republic of Guinea, West Africa, consume 17 different types of cultivated foods that are grown extensively throughout their small, fragmented home range. Direct observations of feeding behavior conducted over an 18-month period revealed that during specific months crops account for up to one quarter of chimpanzee feeding time, with higher overall crop-raiding levels throughout the periods of wild fruit scarcity. Some cultivated foods, especially sugar fruits, are mostly fallback foods, whereas others, such as rice pith (Oryza sp.) and maize (Zea mays), are consumed according to their availability even when wild foods are abundant. These findings highlight the importance of both crop choice by farmers and a thorough understanding of the ecology of resident primate species when establishing land management techniques for alleviating human-primate conflict.

"Play behavioural tactics under space reduction: social challenges in bonobos, Pan paniscus","['Tacconi, G', 'Palagi, E']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.06.004,AUG 2009,8,"Several studies have suggested that primates vary in their response to spatial reduction, which represents a challenge for captive animals. Under spatial reduction, primates can adopt various strategies to reduce social tension. Such strategies, which are not mutually exclusive, can involve avoidance and coping tactics. Recently, it has been shown that, during short-term crowding, bonobos may use both grooming and nonreproductive sexuality to avoid a potential rise in tension. Because bonobos are extremely playful, and play can be a risky activity, we tested whether play patterns were selectively avoided under space reduction. We collected daily data via focal animal sampling on a group of bonobos housed in the Apenheul Primate Park (Apeldoorn, The Netherlands) over a 12-month period. Among the adults, we found no difference in the contact play levels play fighting between the two space conditions (outdoors, 5000 m(2), and indoors, 230 m(2)), whereas indoors, there was a tendency toward an increase in locomotor-rotational play frequency. These findings indicate that bonobos do not adopt an avoidance tactic to reduce the risk involved in space reduction. Nevertheless, dyads showing higher rates of agonistic encounters were less likely to engage in contact play sessions. Even though it is difficult to affirm that space availability significantly induced higher playmate selectivity, we found that play signals significantly increased indoors, thus suggesting the need for a clearer 'declaration of intentions' in an unsafe situation.

Animal-visitor interactions in the modern zoo: Conflicts and interventions,"['Fernandez, EJ', 'Tamborski, MA', 'Pickens, SR', 'Timberlake, W']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2009.06.002,AUG 2009,32,"Animal welfare, education, conservation, research, and entertainment are major goals of modern zoos, but they can be in conflict. For example, visitors enjoy learning about and observing natural behavior in captive animals, but visitors often want to observe and interact with the animals in close proximity. Unfortunately, proximity to and social interactions with humans induce stress for many species, particularly primates. We review two general classes of research examining animal-visitor interactions in zoos: (1) effects of exhibit design and the behavior of the animals on zoo visitors, and (2) effects of zoo visitors on the behavior of exhibited animals. We suggest that interventions based on careful attention to exhibit design, species characteristics, and visitor education can increase positive animal-visitor interactions and facilitate the multiple goals of modern zoos.

Revisiting Play Elements and Self-Handicapping in Play: A Comparative Ethogram of Five Old World Monkey Species,"['Petru, M', 'Spinka, M', 'Charvatova, V', 'Lhota, S']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0016217,AUG 2009,12,"Play behavior has been viewed as a mixture of elements drawn from ""serious"" behavior, interspersed by ritualized play signals. Two other types of play behaviors have been overlooked: patterns that are dissimilar from any serious behavior and patterns with self-handicapping character, that is, those that put the animal into unnecessary disadvantageous positions or situations. Here the authors show that these 2 types of patterns can constitute a major part of play repertoire. From our own videorecordings and observations, we constructed play ethograms of 5 monkey species (Semnopithecus entellus, Erythrocebus patas, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, Cercopithecus neglectus, and Cercopithecus diana). The authors evaluated the self-handicapping character of each pattern and in Hanuman langurs also the (dis)similarity to serious behavior. Of the 74 patterns in the 5 species, 33 (45%) were judged to have a self-handicapping character. Of 48 patterns observed in langurs, 16 (33%) were totally dissimilar to any serious langur behavior known to us. The authors discuss the possibility that the different types of play elements may have different functions in play."

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of care style (responsive or basic) and caregiver type (ape or human) during the first 6 months on joint attention in 4 great ape species (Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo spp., and Pan pansicus). Great apes engaged in joint attention with conspecifics and humans regardless of the style of early care they experienced from either a great ape mother or human caregiver. This finding suggests that joint attention is a robust ability in great apes that is resilient against at least sonic differences in early care. Future studies using additional measures of early care quality are recommended."

During an outbreak of respiratory disease in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), and red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus) also staff members showed non-specific upper respiratory signs. One infant female chimpanzee with severe respiratory symptoms died despite immediate medical treatment and was submitted for necropsy.

Methods

Routine post mortem, histological and bacteriological examinations were conducted. Additionally lung tissue samples form the chimpanzee and swab samples from the staff members and the other primates were examined by PCR.

Results

A severe catarrhal to purulent bronchopneumonia and an interstitial pneumonia were found and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in lung samples by PCR. Swab samples from one animal keeper revealed the same HRSV sequence as of the chimpanzee.

Conclusions

Therefore, it is suggested that the outbreak of respiratory disease within a zoological institution was due to transmission of HRSV between both human and primates."

We also examined the effects of LFD or HFD on populations of eubacteria and archaea in chimpanzee feces. Fecal inoculum fermentation from the LFD animals resulted in a higher in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and gas production than from the HFD animals. However, there was an interaction between different inocula and substrates on IVDMD, gas and methane production, and hydrogen recovery (P < 0.001). On the other hand, HFD inoculum increased the production of total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate, and propionate with all tested substrates. The effect of the interaction between the inoculum and substrate on total SCFAs was not observed. Changes in fermentation activities were associated with changes in bacterial populations. DGGE of bacterial DNA revealed shift in population of both archaeal and eubacterial communities. However, a much more complex eubacterial population structure represented by many bands was observed compared with the less variable archaeal population in both diets. Some archaeal bands were related to the uncultured archaea from gastrointestinal tracts of homeothermic animals. Genomic DNA in the dominant eubacterial band in the HFD inoculum was confirmed to be closely related to DNA from Eubacterium biforme. Interestingly, the predominant band in the LFD inoculum represented DNA of probably new or yet-to-be-sequenced species belonging to mycoplasms. Collectively, our results indicated that fecal microbial populations of the captive chimpanzees are not capable of extensive fiber fermentation; however, there was a positive effect of fiber content on SCFA production.

Sexual Behavior in Female Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla): Evidence for Sexual Competition,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Perdue, BM', 'Legg, AM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20692,JUL 2009,5,"Previous research in gorillas suggests that females engage in post-conception mating as a form of sexual competition designed to improve their own reproductive success.

All females engaged in mating outside their conceptive periods, although there was individual variation in the frequency of the behavior. An analysis of the presence/absence of sexual behavior found females, regardless of reproductive condition, were more likely to engage in sexual behavior on days when other females were sexually active. On these ""co-occurrence"" days, females were significantly more likely to solicit the silverback, but copulations did not differ from expectation. The results find further evidence for sexual competition among female gorillas and suggest that this may occur throughout their reproductive cycle rather than only during pregnancy. Am. J.

Great apes' performance in discriminating weight and achromatic color,"['Schrauf, C', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-009-0216-1,JUL 2009,6,"Much work has been done on visual discrimination in primates over the past decade. In contrast, very little is known about the relevance of non-visual information in discrimination learning. We investigated weight and achromatic color (color, henceforth) discrimination in bonobos, gorillas and orangutans, using the exchange paradigm in which subjects have to give objects to the experimenter in order to receive a reward. Unlike previous studies, subjects were not trained to lift objects because lifting the objects was an integral part of the exchange procedure. This methodology also allowed us a direct comparison between visual and weight discrimination. We presented 12 subjects (5 bonobos, 2 gorillas and 5 orangutans) with two sets of objects corresponding to two conditions. The objects in the color condition (white/black) differed only in color and those in the weight condition (light/heavy) differed only in weight. Five apes learned to discriminate weight and six to discriminate color. Subjects learned color discrimination faster than weight discrimination. Our results suggest that bonobos and orangutans are sensitive to differences in weight and able to learn discriminating objects that differ in this property."
Discriminating between village and commercial hunting of apes,"['Kuehl, HS', 'Nzeingui, C', 'Yeno, SLD', 'Huijbregts, B', 'Boesch, C', 'Walsh, PD']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2009.02.032,JUL 2009,14,"Hunting is the major driver of large mammal decline in Central African forests. in slowly reproducing species even low hunting pressure leaves spatial gradients with wildlife density increasing with distance from transport routes and human settlements. Park management can use this pattern formation to identify sources of threats, but also to discriminate between different threat scenarios, such as the impact of subsistence vs. commercial hunting. We conducted an ape survey in the mountainous Moukalaba Doudou National Park, Gabon, to evaluate whether potential population gradients would emanate from the three human population centers in the region or the villages surrounding the park. Using generalized linear modeling we found hill slope as a good predictor of ape nest occurrence probability and the distance to human population centers a better predictor of ape nest density and ape nest group size than distance to villages. In fact ape nest density was three times lower at the park borders close to the human population centers than in the park's interior. The results indicate that Moukalaba's ape population is more impacted by commercial than subsistence hunting and suggest that park management should focus conservation efforts on the human population centers. We conclude that in particular for slowly reproducing species geographic information on wildlife population gradients are of additional value for guiding protected area management. The hunting impact on those species might be easily underestimated, if derived only from market surveys or transport route controls, where they are only rarely found. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An urgent question then, is whether these 'empty' forests can sustain their biodiversity without large vertebrates. Here we examine the role of forest elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) seed dispersal in maintaining the community structure of trees in the Ndoki Forest, northern Congo. Analysis of 855 elephant dung piles suggested that forest elephants disperse more intact seeds than any other species or genus of large vertebrate in African forests, while GPS telemetry data showed that forest elephants regularly disperse seeds over unprecedented distances compared to other dispersers. Our analysis of the spatial distribution of trees from a sample of 5667 individuals showed that dispersal mechanism was tightly correlated with the scale of spatial aggregation. Increasing amounts of elephant seed dispersal was associated with decreasing aggregation. At distances of < 200 m, trees whose seeds are dispersed only by elephants were less aggregated than the random expectation, suggesting Janzen-Connell effects on seed/seedling mortality. At the landscape scale, seed dispersal mode predicted the rate at which local tree community similarity decayed in space. Our results suggest that the loss of forest elephants (and other large-bodied dispersers) may lead to a wave of recruitment failure among animal-dispersed tree species, and favor regeneration of the species-poor abiotically dispersed guild of trees."
"A Survey of Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in the Selectively Logged Ngotto Forest, Central African Republic","['Hicks, TC', 'Fouts, RS', 'Fouts, DH']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,10.1080/10888700902955872,JUL-SEP 2009,3,"Currently, the timber company Industrie Forestiere du Batalimo is selectively logging the Ngotto Forest in the Central African Republic. The forest is home to a population of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and provides the Bofi-speaking people of Grima with food, medicine, housing material, and other commodities. Over a 7-month period, the research team conducted a line-transect survey of the great ape population in the forests to the south of Grima to document their distribution. For comparison purposes, the team also surveyed a section of adjacent forest that had already been logged. Ape nests were significantly rarer in the logged forest than in the unlogged forest, and ape nests were most common in the more pristine forests to the south. This report further discusses the effects of logging and other human activities."
Positive Reinforcement Training Moderates Only High Levels of Abnormal Behavior in Singly Housed Rhesus Macaques,"['Baker, KC', 'Bloomsmith, M', 'Neu, K', 'Griffis, C', 'Maloney, M', 'Oettinger, B', 'Schoof, VAM', 'Martinez, M']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,10.1080/10888700902956011,JUL-SEP 2009,11,"This study evaluated the application of positive reinforcement training (PRT) as an intervention for abnormal behaviors in singly housed laboratory rhesus macaques at 2 large primate facilities. Training involved basic control behaviors and body-part presentation. The study compared baseline behavioral data on 30 adult mates and 33 adult females compared with 3 treatment phases presented in counterbalanced order: 6 min per week of PRT, 20 or 40 min per week of PRT, and 6 min per week of unstructured human interaction (HI). Within-subject parametric tests detected no main or interaction effects involving experimental phase. However, among a subset of subjects with levels of abnormal in the top quartile of the range (n = 15), abnormal behavior was reduced from 35% to 25% of samples with PRT but not with HI. These results suggest that short durations of PRT applied as enrichment for this species and in this context may not in itself be sufficient intervention for abnormal behavior because levels remained high. However, it may be appropriate as an adjunct to other interventions and may be best targeted to the most severely affected individuals."

The complexities of thorough literature searches are more difficult for nondomestic animal clinical cases and research reviews as demonstrated by three search requests involving poisonous snakes, a gorilla, and spiders. Expanding and better disseminating the knowledgebase of zoological medicine will make veterinary searching easier."

Isolation and Characterization of Adenoviruses Persistently Shed from the Gastrointestinal Tract of Non-Human Primates,"['Roy, S', 'Vandenberghe, LH', 'Kryazhimskiy, S', 'Grant, R', 'Calcedo, R', 'Yuan, X', 'Keough, M', 'Sandhu, A', 'Wang, Q', 'Medina-Jaszek, CA', 'Plotkin, JB', 'Wilson, JM']",PLOS PATHOGENS,10.1371/journal.ppat.1000503,JUL 2009,52,"Adenoviruses are important human pathogens that have been developed as vectors for gene therapies and genetic vaccines. Previous studies indicated that human infections with adenoviruses are self-limiting in immunocompetent hosts with evidence of some persistence in adenoid tissue. We sought to better understand the natural history of adenovirus infections in various non-human primates and discovered that healthy populations of great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) and macaques shed substantial quantities of infectious adenoviruses in stool. Shedding in stools from asymptomatic humans was found to be much less frequent, comparable to frequencies reported before. We purified and fully sequenced 30 novel adenoviruses from apes and 3 novel adenoviruses from macaques. Analyses of the new ape adenovirus sequences (as well as the 4 chimpanzee adenovirus sequences we have previously reported) together with 22 complete adenovirus genomes available from GenBank revealed that (a) the ape adenoviruses could clearly be classified into species corresponding to human adenovirus species B, C, and E, (b) there was evidence for intraspecies recombination between adenoviruses, and (c) the high degree of phylogenetic relatedness of adenoviruses across their various primate hosts provided evidence for cross species transmission events to have occurred in the natural history of B and E viruses. The high degree of asymptomatic shedding of live adenovirus in non-human primates and evidence for zoonotic transmissions warrants caution for primate handling and housing. Furthermore, the presence of persistent and/or latent adenovirus infections in the gut should be considered in the design and interpretation of human and non-human primate studies with adenovirus vectors."
Estimation of African apes' body size from postcranial dimensions,"['Niskanen, M', 'Junno, JA']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-009-0131-8,JUL 2009,3,"We examine how African apes' postcranial skeletal dimensions and their combinations are related to body size, as represented by trunk volume, within sex-specific samples of a total of 39 central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and 34 western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). We examine this relationship by determining the strength of the correlation between selected skeletal dimensions and trunk volume. The findings indicate that sex should be taken into account when possible. Most two-predictor models perform better than most single-predictor models. Interspecific regressions based on log-transformed variables and sex/species-specific regression based on raw variables perform about equally well."
Buccal dental microwear variability in extant African Hominoidea: taxonomy versus ecology,"['Galbany, J', 'Estebaranz, F', 'Martinez, LM', 'Perez-Perez, A']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-009-0139-0,JUL 2009,14,"Buccal microwear patterns on teeth are good indicators of the abrasiveness of foodstuffs and have been used to trace the dietary habits of fossil species, including primates and hominids. However, few studies have addressed the variability of this microwear. The abrasiveness of dietary components depends not only on the hardness of the particles ingested, but also on the presence of dust and other exogenous elements introduced during food processing. These elements are responsible for the microwear typology observed on the enamel surfaces of primate teeth. Here we analyzed the variability of buccal microwear patterns in African Great Apes (Gorilla gorilla and Pan troglodytes), using tooth molds obtained from the original specimens held in several osteological collections. Our results suggest that ecological adaptations at subspecies or population level account for differences in microwear patterns, which are attributed to habitat and ecological conditions within populations rather than differences between species. The findings from studies on the variability of buccal dental microwear in extant species will contribute to a better understanding of extinct hominids' diet and ecology."
Hand-clapping as a communicative gesture by wild female swamp gorillas,"['Kalan, AK', 'Rainey, HJ']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-009-0130-9,JUL 2009,11,Hand-clapping is a form of gestural communication commonly observed in captive great apes yet only isolated instances of this behaviour have been documented in the wild. Nearly 20 years ago Fay recorded the first observations of hand-clapping in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in the Central African Republic. Here we present observations of Likouala swamp gorillas using hand-clapping as a form of gestural communication in previously undocumented contexts in the wild. We observed hand-clapping on four different occasions in four different groups. The hand-clap was always exhibited by an adult female and always consisted of two consecutive claps conducted in front of the body. We suggest the functional significance of the behaviour was to maintain and enforce group cohesiveness during instances of alarm. These observations suggest western lowland gorillas have a means of communicating that is thus far absent in their eastern counterparts (Gorilla beringei ssp.). This could be a gestural culture found only in western lowland gorillas which should be investigated further to shed light on the evolution of communication among hominoids.
The residual humanism of hybridity: retaining a sense of the earth,"['Lulka, D']",TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS,10.1111/j.1475-5661.2009.00346.x,JUL 2009,43,"The concept of hybridity has become an influential theoretical tool for examining and reconsidering relations between society and nature. Although benefits have accrued from this school of thought, this paper contends the deployment of hybridity within the geographic discipline falls short of its reconstitutional claims. These shortcomings are a consequence of the original sources used to develop the language and logic of hybridity. Although the concept of hybridity has a long history in the biological sciences, the utilisation of hybridity in the geographic discipline has predominantly relied upon evolving theories developed in science and technology studies. This paper indicates how Haraway's cyborg and Latour's Middle Kingdom limit the scope of hybridity by portraying humanity as central to hybridity. The pervasive centrality of humans within the literature on hybridity (1) limits the ability of geographers to embrace poststructuralism in its entirety and (2) diminishes the discipline's claim to credibly represent the (natural) landscape. This paper argues for a thicker hybridity by borrowing from emergent theories in the biological sciences, wherein hybridity is conceived as a common occurrence that frequently takes place outside the direct purview of society. Rather than reifying nature, thick hybridity forces society to embrace environmental uncertainty more than it has heretofore."
A unique Middle Miocene European hominoid and the origins of the great ape and human clade,"['Moya-Sola, S', 'Alba, DM', 'Almecija, S', 'Casanovas-Vilar, I', 'Kohler, M', 'De Esteban-Trivigno, S', 'Robles, JM', 'Galindo, J', 'Fortuny, J']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0811730106,JUN 16 2009,34,"The great ape and human clade (Primates: Hominidae) currently includes orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, and humans. When, where, and from which taxon hominids evolved are among the most exciting questions yet to be resolved. Within the Afropithecidae, the Kenyapithecinae (Kenyapithecini + Equatorini) have been proposed as the sister taxon of hominids, but thus far the fragmentary and scarce Middle Miocene fossil record has hampered testing this hypothesis. Here we describe a male partial face with mandible of a previously undescribed fossil hominid, Anoiapithecus brevirostris gen. et sp. nov., from the Middle Miocene (11.9 Ma) of Spain, which enables testing this hypothesis. Morphological and geometric morphometrics analyses of this material show a unique facial pattern for hominoids. This taxon combines autapomorphic features-such as a strongly reduced facial prognathism-with kenyapithecine (more specifically, kenyapithecin) and hominid synapomorphies. This combination supports a sister-group relationship between kenyapithecins (Griphopithecus + Kenyapithecus) and hominids. The presence of both groups in Eurasia during the Middle Miocene and the retention in kenyapithecins of a primitive hominoid postcranial body plan support a Eurasian origin of the Hominidae. Alternatively, the two extant hominid clades (Homininae and Ponginae) might have independently evolved in Africa and Eurasia from an ancestral, Middle Miocene stock, so that the supposed crown-hominid synapomorphies might be homoplastic."

Urb. (Humiriaceae) are a keystone resource for forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis Matschie) in a coastal rain forest, the REserve de Faune du Petit Loango, Gabon (now part of Loango National Park). Faecal counts demonstrated that forest elephants used Sacoglottis-dominated forest more when Sacoglottis was abundant and electivity indices suggest that Sacoglottis is a preferred food. The flora of Petit Loango is characterized by the absence of herbaceous vegetation such as Marantaceae and Zingiberaceae, and during the prolonged dry season few fleshy fruits are present other than Sacoglottis fruits, which are produced in a glut during this time. While inter-annual fruiting reliability remains to be confirmed, fruit production in 1998 and high stem density relative to other study sites provide indirect evidence that Sacoglottis fruits are a reliable inter-annual resource at Petit Loango. It is thus proposed that Sacoglottis gabonensis fruits fulfil an important role as a keystone 'fallback' resource for forest elephants during the dry season at Petit Loango."

The new data indicate that D. fontani is distinct at the genus level from Late Miocene European taxa previously attributed to Dryopithecus, which are here reassigned to Hispanopithecus. The new facial specimen also suggests that D. fontani and the Middle Miocene Pierolapithecus catalaunicus are not synonymous. Anatomical and morphometric analyses further indicate that the new specimen shows a combination of lower facial features-hitherto unknown in Miocene hominoids-that resembles the facial pattern of Gorilla, thus providing the first nondental evidence of gorilla-like lower facial morghology in the fossil record. Considering the current evidence, the gorilla-like facial pattern of D. fontani is inferred to be derived relative to previously known stem hominids, and might indicate that this taxon is either an early member of the Homininae or, alternatively, a stem hominid convergent with the lower facial pattern of Gorilla. The biogeographic implications of both alternatives are discussed. This new finding in the Hostalets de Pierola section reinforces the importance of this area for understanding the elusive question of the Middle Miocene origin and early radiation of great apes.

Although sample size constraints make interspecific comparisons difficult, postcranial differences between Australopithecus afarensis and Australopithecus africanus have been reported (McHenry and Berger: J Hum Evol 35 [1998] 1-22; Richmond et al.: J Hum Evol 43 [2002] 529-548; Green et al.: J Hum Evol 52 [2007] 187-200). Additional evidence indicates that the early members of the genus Homo show morphology like recent humans (e.g., Walker and Leakey: The Nariokotome Homo erectus skeleton. Cambridge: Harvard, 1993). Using a larger fossil sample than previous studies and novel methods, the early hominin proximal femur is newly examined to determine whether new data alter the current view of femoral evolution and inform the issue of interspecific morphological variation among australopiths. Two- and three-dimensional data are collected from large samples of recent humans, Pan, Gorilla, and Pongo and original fossil femora of Australopithecus, Paranthropus, and femora of African fossil Homo. The size-adjusted shape data are analyzed using principal components, thin plate spline analysis, and canonical variate analysis to assess shape variation. The results indicate that femora of fossil Homo are most similar to modern humans but share a low neck-shaft angle (NSA) with australopiths. Australopiths as a group have ape-like greater trochanter morphology. A. afarensis differs from R robustus and A. africanus in attributes of the neck and NSA. However, interspecific femoral variation is low and australopiths are generally morphologically similar. Although the differences are not dramatic, when considered in combination with other postcranial evidence, the adaptive differences among australopiths in craniodental morphology may have parallels in the postcranium.

However, small-bodied nocturnal species are not well represented on the long list of primates surveyed in the wild, and reproductive inferences regarding these animals in their natural habitats have not benefited from direct observations of hormonal changes. We collected fecal samples from female brown mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus) in a southeastern rainforest of Madagascar in order to determine whether or not fecally excreted steroid levels show a consistent pattern of change during the reproductive season and are a useful complement to reproductive observations in wild-trapped individuals. Initial data show variation in reproductive hormone levels before and after estrus and estimated day of parturition. Elevated levels of excreted estradiol (E(2)) were observed around the time of estrus, whereas high levels of fecal progesterone (P) were seen during later stages of pregnancy and around parturition. A more complete picture of reproductive profiles in female mouse lemurs, and how they may change over the life span, can be obtained if hormone analyses are used to supplement field observations. Am.

Interactions Between Zoo-Housed Great Apes and Local Wildlife,"['Ross, SR', 'Holmes, AN', 'Lonsdorf, EV']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20675,JUN 2009,2,"Although there are published reports of wild chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans hunting and consuming vertebrate prey, data pertaining to captive apes remain sparse. In this survey-based study, we evaluate the prevalence and nature of interactions between captive great apes and various indigenous wildlife species that range into their enclosures in North America. Our hypotheses were threefold: (a) facilities housing chimpanzees will report the most frequent and most aggressive interactions with local wildlife; (b) facilities housing orangutans and bonobos will report intermediate frequencies of these interactions with low levels of aggression and killing; and (c) facilities housing gorillas will report the lowest frequency of interactions and no reports of killing local wildlife. Chimpanzees and bonobos demonstrated the most aggressive behavior toward wildlife, which matched our predictions for chimpanzees, but not bonobos. This fits well with expectations for chimpanzees based on their natural history of hunting and consuming prey in wild settings, and also supports new field data on bonobos. Captive gorillas and orangutans were reported to be much less likely to chase, catch and kill wildlife than chimpanzees and bonobos. Gorillas were the least likely to engage in aggressive interactions with local wildlife, matching our predictions based on natural history. However unlike wild gorillas, captive gorillas were reported to kill (and in one case, eat) local wildlife. These results suggest that some behavioral patterns seen in captive groups of apes may be useful for modeling corresponding activities in the wild that may not be as easily observed and quantified. Furthermore, the data highlight the potential for disease transmission in some captive settings, and we outline the associated implications for ape health and safety. Am. J.

This ability develops in a protracted, mosaic fashion in humans.

We conclude that there is little evidence for human species-unique cognitive adaptations in the non-verbal communication of humans in the first 18 months of life. This conclusion is consistent with the Narrative Practice Hypothesis (NPH) because the NPH posits training in folk psychological narratives as a basis for folk psychological competence."
Size and shape variation in the proximal femur of Australopithecus africanus,"['Harmon, E']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2009.01.002,JUN 2009,13,"Aside from use as estimates of body mass dimorphism and fore to hind limb joint size comparisons, postcranial elements have not often contributed to assessments of variation in Australopithecus africanus. Meanwhile, cranial, facial, and dental size variation is interpreted to be high or moderately high. Further, the cranial base and face express patterns of structural (shape) variation, which are interpreted by some as evidence for the presence of multiple species. Here, the proximal femur is used to consider postcranial size and shape variation in A. africanus. Original fossils from Makapansgat and Sterkfontein, and samples from Homo, Pan, Gorilla, and Pongo were measured. Size variation was assessed by comparing the A. africanus coefficient of variation to bootstrapped distributions of coefficient of variation samples for each taxon. Shape variation was assessed from isometrically adjusted shape variables. First, the A. africanus standard deviation of log transformed shape variables was compared to bootstrapped distributions of logged standard deviations in each taxon. Second, shape variable based Euclidean distances between fossil pairs were compared to pairwise Euclidean distance distributions in each reference taxon. The degree of size variation in the A. africanus proximal femur is consistent with that of a single species, and is most comparable to Homo and Pan, lower than A. afarensis, and lower than some estimates of cranial and dental variation. Some, but not all, shape variables show more variation in A. africanus than in extant taxa. The degree of shape difference between some fossils exceeds the majority of pairwise differences in the reference taxa. Proximal femoral shape, but not size, variation is consistent with high estimates of A. africanus cranial variation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

On the other hand, PCSAs of the extrinsic pedal digital flexors and digiti minimi muscles were larger in the western lowland gorilla, suggesting that the foot, particularly the fifth toe, has a relatively high grasping capability in the lowland gorilla."

Transverse Foramen of the Atlas (C1) Anteriorly Unclosed A Misknown Human Variant and Its Evolutionary Significance,"['Billmann, F', 'Le Minor, JM']",SPINE,10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181a2e07e,MAY 20 2009,0,"Study Design. Morphologic study of 500 human adult atlases, 256 atlases of nonhuman adult primates representing 37 genera, and 25 human atlases of newborns and young individuals from birth to 3 years of age.

Objective. To provide original observations to attempt to understand the anterior unclosure of the transverse foramen of the human atlas, to ascertain its occurrence in primates, and to offer some elements regarding the evolutionary and functional significance of this disposition.

Summary of Background Data. Anteriorly unclosed transverse foramen is one of the classic variants of the human atlas, however, rare quantitative data are available in the literature and this disposition remains little understood.

Methods. Macroscopical study (dried bones).

Results. In humans, an anteriorly unclosed transverse foramen was observed on one or both sides in 51 individuals of the 500 in the present series (10.2%); bilateral occurrence (symmetric manifestation) was observed in 45.1% of the anterior unclosures and unilateral occurrence in 54.9%; no significant right or left predominance was observed in the frequency of lateral occurrence. In human newborns and young individuals (from birth to 3 years of age), the transverse foramen was anteriorly unclosed in all of the 25 cases studied. In nonhuman primates, some bilateral or unilateral cases of anterior unclosure were only observed in hominoids, except gibbons: orangutans (8.3%), gorillas (10.5%), and chimpanzees (14.3%).

Conclusion. The anteriorly unclosed transverse foramen of the atlas seems to be the result of an evolutionary tendency characteristic of hominoids within primates and could be interpreted as a shared derived character (i.e., synapomorphy) and as the persistence in adults of a juvenile pattern (i.e., paedomorphosis). It must not be interpreted as a pathologic erosion or destruction but as being a simple normal variant."

Surprisingly, P. reichenowi, a chimpanzee parasite, is the only such parasite to have been molecularly characterized. This parasite is closely phylogenetically related to P. falciparum, the principal cause of the greatest malaria burden in humans. Studies of malaria parasites from anthropoid primates may provide relevant phylogenetic information, improving our understanding of the origin and evolutionary history of human malaria species. In this study, we screened 130 DNA samples from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) from Cameroon for Plasmodium infection, using cytochrome b molecular tools. Two chimpanzees from the subspecies Pan t. troglodytes presented single infections with Plasmodium strains molecularly related to the human malaria parasite P. ovale. These chimpanzee parasites and 13 human strains of P. ovale originated from a various sites in Africa and Asia were characterized using cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase 1 mitochondrial partial genes and nuclear ldh partial gene. Consistent with previous findings, two genetically distinct types of P. ovale, classical and variant, were observed in the human population from a variety of geographical locations. One chimpanzee Plasmodium strain was genetically identical, on all three markers tested, to variant P. ovale type.

This study provides the first evidence of possibility of natural cross-species exchange of P. ovale between humans and chimpanzees of the subspecies Pan t. troglodytes."
The evolution of primate visual self-recognition: evidence of absence in lesser apes,"['Suddendorf, T', 'Collier-Baker, E']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rspb.2008.1754,MAY 7 2009,23,"Mirror self-recognition typically emerges in human children in the second year of life and has been documented in great apes. In contrast to monkeys, humans and great apes can use mirrors to inspect unusual marks on their body that cannot be seen directly. Here we show that lesser apes ( family Hylobatidae) fail to use the mirror to find surreptitiously placed marks on their head, in spite of being strongly motivated to retrieve directly visible marks from the mirror surface itself and from their own limbs. These findings suggest that the capacity for visual self-recognition evolved in a common ancestor of all great apes after the split from the line that led to modern lesser apes approximately 18 Myr ago. They also highlight the potential of a comparative approach for identifying the neurological and genetic underpinnings of self-recognition and other higher cognitive faculties."
Post-Conflict Third-Party Affiliation in Chimpanzees: What's in it for the Third Party?,"['Koski, SE', 'Sterck, EHM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20668,MAY 2009,18,"Affiliative behavior after conflicts between conflict participants and other group members is common in many primate species. The proposed functions for such triadic interactions are numerous, mostly concerning the benefit for the former conflict opponents. We investigated post-conflict third-party affiliation (TPA) in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with the aim of assessing what the affiliating third parties may gain from affiliation. Specifically, we tested whether third-party-initiated affiliation protects the third parties from further aggression by conflict opponents. We found support for this ""self-protection hypothesis,"" in that third parties selectively directed affiliation to those opponents who more often gave further aggression to them, and affiliation effectively decreased their chance of receiving aggression from these opponents. However, a subset of affiliation, provided to conflict victims by their own kin, appeared to not be self-protective and the function of it remained open. We conclude that chimpanzee third-party-initiated affiliation is a more ;heterogeneous behavior than thus far assumed. Am. J. Primatol. 71:409-418, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
"Molecular characterization, polymorphism and association study of lysozyme gene with milk production and somatic cell trait in Bos indicus X Bos taurus cattle","['Salehin, M', 'Ghosh, AK', 'Mallick, PK', 'Bhattacharya, TK']",ANIMAL,10.1017/S1751731109003620,MAY 2009,2,"Lysozyme, an anti-bacterial enzyme, is mostly found in the body fluids, various tissues and secretions of animals and humans, and confers immunity against a wide range of bacterial species. The present study was carried out to elucidate the gene sequence of this enzyme in Indian Sahiwal X Holstein Friesian crossbred cattle and to explore the polymorphism of the gene as well as their association with milk production and somatic cell traits. The total length of lysozyme cDNA was found to be of 447 bp. The similarity with Bos taurus, human, pig, monkey, gorilla, mice, rat, chicken, dog and sheep was estimated as 99.1%, 85%, 81.0%, 85.2%, 84.3%, 77.9%, 77.9%, 41.4%, 40.5% and 24.6%, respectively. Polymorphism study of two fragments, extended exon1 including promoter exon1 and partial intron 1 (268 bp), and extended exon2 including partial intron 1 and 2, and exon2 region (287 bp) of milk lysozyme gene was carried out by employing single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP). In the extended exon1 fragment, three alleles namely A, B and C with frequencies of 0.59, 0.28 and 0.12 were observed while in the exon extended fragment, three different alleles - P, Q and R with respective frequencies of 0.61, 0.38 and 0.01 - were determined in Indian Sahiwal X Holstein Friesian cross. A total of eight haplotypes were found in this population where the most predominant one was h1 (0.52). Genotypes of exon1 extended fragment showed significant association with total milk yield, daily milk yield, peak yield and somatic cell score at P<0.05 while that of exon2 extended fragment had significant correlation with only total lactational milk yield. Haplotype combinations also revealed significant association with total milk production where h1h1 homozygous showed highest yield during first lactation."
"An experimental, comparative investigation of tool use in chimpanzees and gorillas","['Lonsdorf, EV', 'Ross, SR', 'Linick, SA', 'Milstein, MS', 'Melber, TN']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.01.020,MAY 2009,26,"Studies of ape tool use have been conducted in captivity since the early 1900s and in the wild since the 1960s. Chimpanzees are the most prolific tool users among the apes, and are known to use more tools than any other nonhuman animal. In contrast, reports of gorilla tool use are rare both in wild and captive settings. Studies of the processes involved in tool use learning have been limited in the wild by the lack of ability to control several unpredictable variables, and in captivity by tool use opportunities that are often presented in non-naturalistic contexts. We attempted to address both of these limitations by providing naive subjects with a naturalistic tool use device (built to simulate a termite mound) while housed in a more natural social setting to approximate how learning would occur in the wild. Both gorillas and chimpanzees participated in the experiment to allow comparative analyses of acquisition of tool behaviour and the factors that may affect acquisition. Both species showed low frequencies of interaction with the mound in the baseline condition, before baiting with a food reward. Once baited, chimpanzees both attempted and succeeded to extract the reward more quickly than did gorillas. The number of social group members at the mound was significantly higher for chimpanzees than for gorillas and may have affected skill acquisition. We advocate that comparative approaches to skill acquisition and learning are valuable, but that researchers need to be cognizant of species differences in social structure that may affect results.

"Proximate factors influencing dispersal decisions in male mountain gorillas, Gorilla beringei beringei","['Stoinski, TS', 'Vecellio, V', 'Ngaboyamahina, T', 'Ndagijimana, F', 'Rosenbaum, S', 'Fawcett, KA']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.12.030,MAY 2009,13,"We examined demographic and behavioural influences on the dispersal decisions of 31 male mountain gorillas living in mixed-sex groups. Approximately half (45%) of silverback males dispersed from the groups in which they matured. Mean dispersal age corresponded with the age of physical maturity. For two-thirds (64%) of males, dispersal was a one time decision. The remaining individuals made repeated visits to their natal groups before permanently dispersing. Of dispersing males, 43% left with females. The remaining individuals dispersed alone, despite the presence of similar-aged male dispersal partners in their group. Dispersal decisions appeared voluntary; there was no evidence of increased aggression by the dominant silverback or peripheralization in the months prior to dispersal. Instead, dispersal decisions were influenced by limited opportunities to copulate within the group and the absence of a male's mother. Dispersing did not provide increased access to females, at least in the short term; only three dispersing males were observed to form groups whereas the remaining eight for whom data were available remained solitary (range 1-112 months) at the end of the study. The question remains why males choose to disperse rather than remain philopatric. Inbreeding avoidance seems unlikely, as all groups contained unrelated females. It may be that dispersal decisions are the result of several factors acting in combination, and thus dispersal is a more appropriate option for some males. Alternatively, dispersal decisions may actually be disadvantageous and reflect an incomplete adaptation to the ecological extremes of the Virunga region.

"Gestural communication of the gorilla (Gorilla gorilla): repertoire, intentionality and possible origins","['Genty, E', 'Breuer, T', 'Hobaiter, C', 'Byrne, RW']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-009-0213-4,MAY 2009,73,"Social groups of gorillas were observed in three captive facilities and one African field site. Cases of potential gesture use, totalling 9,540, were filtered by strict criteria for intentionality, giving a corpus of 5,250 instances of intentional gesture use. This indicated a repertoire of 102 gesture types. Most repertoire differences between individuals and sites were explicable as a consequence of environmental affordances and sampling effects: overall gesture frequency was a good predictor of universality of occurrence. Only one gesture was idiosyncratic to a single individual, and was given only to humans. Indications of cultural learning were few, though not absent. Six gestures appeared to be traditions within single social groups, but overall concordance in repertoires was almost as high between as within social groups. No support was found for the ontogenetic ritualization hypothesis as the chief means of acquisition of gestures. Many gestures whose form ruled out such an origin, i.e. gestures derived from species-typical displays, were used as intentionally and almost as flexibly as gestures whose form was consistent with learning by ritualization. When using both classes of gesture, gorillas paid specific attention to the attentional state of their audience. Thus, it would be unwarranted to divide ape gestural repertoires into 'innate, species-typical, inflexible reactions' and 'individually learned, intentional, flexible communication'. We conclude that gorilla gestural communication is based on a species-typical repertoire, like those of most other mammalian species but very much larger. Gorilla gestures are not, however, inflexible signals but are employed for intentional communication to specific individuals."
Do gorillas regurgitate potentially-injurious stomach acid during 'regurgitation and reingestion?',"['Hill, SP']",ANIMAL WELFARE,NA,MAY 2009,5,"Regurgitation and reingestion (R/R) of foodstuffs is a common abnormal behaviour in captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and certain other non-human primates, but it is not part of their normal feeding mechanism. It is similar to a behavioural problem seen in humans, human rumination syndrome (HRS), which can occur in association with anxiety or a poor relationship with a caregiver. Patients with HRS often regurgitate stomach acid with the food matter which can result in clinical problems; until this study, it was not known if stomach acid is regurgitated by gorillas also. Thus, samples of regurgitated matter were collected opportunistically and non-invasively, and pH was measured using an electronic meter. Results were compared with the pH of samples of the original food eaten by the gorillas, and show that regurgitated food has significantly higher acidity than the originally-ingested meal. By comparison, samples of saliva were collected from gorillas opportunistically, in the absence of recent ingestion, and were found to be alkaline and, thus, saliva should not have contributed to the increased acidity of regurgitated matter. The results imply that stomach acid is being regurgitated. as in human patients with potentially-injurious rumination syndrome, and it is indicative of sub-optimal welfare. Causes and effects of R/R should be investigated further, to lead to potential treatment and prevention and to promote the welfare of captive gorillas."

Oligosaccharides containing the type II unit (Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc) were found exclusively (gorilla and siamang) or predominately (chimpanzee, bonobo, and orangutan) over those containing the type I unit (Gal(beta 1-3)GlcNAc). In comparison, type I oligosaccharides predominate over type II oligosaccharides in human milk, whereas nonprimate milk almost always contains only type II oligosaccharides. The milk or colostrum of the great apes contained oligosaccharides bearing both N-glycolylneuraminic acid and N-acetylneuraminic acid, whereas human milk contains only the latter. Great ape milk, like that of humans, contained fucosylated oligosaccharides whereas siamang milk did not. Since these analyses are based on a limited number of individuals, further research on additional samples of great and lesser ape milk is needed to confirm phylogenetic patterns."

The aims were: (a) to find out if great apes are subject to gravity biased search or display sensitivity for object solidity, (b) to check for species differences, and (c) to assess if a gravity hypothesis or more parsimonious explanations best account for failures observed. Results indicate that great apes, unlike monkeys, show no reliable gravity bias, that ape species slightly differ in terms of their performance, and that the errors made are best explained by a gravity account."

Reproductive Aging in Captive and Wild Common Chimpanzees: Factors Influencing the Rate of Follicular Depletion,"['Atsalis, S', 'Videan, E', 'NATURAL MENOPAUSE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20650,APR 2009,15,"We examine and discuss evidence of contrasting differences in fertility patterns between captive and wild female chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, as they age; in the wild females reproduce in their 40s, but captive studies suggest that menopause occurs around that time. Thus, despite the increased longevity generally observed in captive populations reproductive life span is shortened. We outline a hypothesis to explain the apparent differential pace of reproductive decline observed between wild and captive populations. The breeding schedules of captive primates may contribute to accelerated reproductive senescence because continuous cycling in captive animals results in early depletion of the ovarian stock and premature senescence. Available evidence supports the hypothesis that women with patterns of high oocyte loss experience earlier menopause. Chimpanzees in captivity live longer, and thus, similar to humans, they may experience follicular depletion that precedes death by many years. In captivity, chimpanzees typically have an early age at menarche and first birth, shorter interbirth intervals associated with short lactational. periods as young mature faster, and nursery rearing, which allows mothers to begin cycling earlier. Variables typical of wild chimpanzee populations, including late age at menarche and first birth, long interbirth intervals associated with prolonged lactational periods, and a long period of female infertility after immigration, spare ovulations and may be responsible for the later age at reproductive termination. Finally, we describe and discuss the timing of specific reproductive landmarks that occur as female chimpanzees age, distinguishing between functional menopause (age at last birth) and operational menopause (end of cycling).

Leave or conceive: natal dispersal and philopatry of female mountain gorillas in the Virunga volcano region,"['Robbins, AM', 'Stoinski, T', 'Fawcett, K', 'Robbins, MM']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.12.005,APR 2009,16,"Natal dispersal is often attributed to inbreeding avoidance, competition for resources or competition for mates, but the patterns and frequency of dispersal vary considerably among and even within species. We examined the possible reasons for dispersal and philopatry of natal nulliparous female mountain gorillas, Gorilla gorilla beringei, in the Virunga volcano region, including comparisons with non-natal and/or parous females. Competition among females is generally weak and ineffective in this population, and inbreeding avoidance has been considered the ultimate cause of natal dispersal. Yet fewer than half of nulliparous females left their natal group when the dominant male was old enough to be their father, so they did not rely entirely upon dispersal to avoid such risk of inbreeding. Almost all natal nulliparous females were with at least one sexually active male who was not old enough to be their father, so the presence or absence of such mating alternatives also did not determine whether they left. Natal nulliparous females were more likely to leave groups with only one adult male, where infanticide losses have been higher than in multimale groups. Thus natal dispersal seemed to be influenced by infanticide avoidance, which has been considered the ultimate cause of secondary dispersal. Natal nulliparous females have more time to encounter suitable destinations than other females, which may be a proximate reason why they were more likely to transfer despite having the same ultimate cause of dispersal.

Sensory stimulation as environmental enrichment for captive animals: A review,"['Wells, DL', 'AUDITORY-STIMULATION']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2009.01.002,APR 2009,38,"In the wild, animals are exposed to an ever-changing array of sensory stimuli. The captive environment, by contrast, is generally much more impoverished in terms of the sensory cues it offers the animals housed within. In a bid to remedy this, and promote better welfare, researchers have started to explore the merits of sensory stimulation (i.e. stimulation designed to trigger one or more of an animal's senses) as a potential method of environmental enrichment for captive animals. This paper reviews the research in this area, focusing specifically on auditory, olfactory and visual methods of sensory stimulation. Studies exploring the efficacy of each type of stimulation as an enrichment tool are described, where appropriate, making a distinction between those that occur in the animal's natural habitat, and those that do not. Overall, it is concluded that sensory stimulation harbours enrichment potential for some animals housed in institutional settings, although the specific merits gained from these enrichments are likely to depend upon a wide variety of factors including, for example, species, sex, age and housing conditions. Programmes of sensory enrichment that target the dominant sense for the species under scrutiny, using harmless, non-stressful stimuli, are likely to result in the greatest benefits for animal welfare. Stimuli specific to a species' natural habitat should not always be considered meaningful, or advantageous, to an animal's welfare; in some cases stimuli that do not occur naturally in the wild (e.g. classical Music) may offer more in the way of welfare advantages. Shortcomings in the research, and factors to consider when implementing enrichment of this nature, are discussed throughout. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Milk composition of captive vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) and rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) with observations on gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and white handed gibbon (Hylobates lar),"['Osthoff, G', 'Hugo, A', 'de Wit, M', 'Nguyen, TPM', 'Seier, J']",COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cbpb.2008.12.015,APR 2009,7,"The nutrient content and fatty acid composition of vervet monkey milk has been determined and is compared with rhesus macaque, and two hominoid apes, the white handed gibbon and gorilla. With 15.7 +/- 4.1 g protein, 33.1 +/- 9.4 g fat, and 85.1 +/- 7.5 g lactose per kg milk, vervet monkey milk does not differ from that of rhesus macaque, and is within the range of other primates. Small amounts (> 1 g kg(-1)) of oligosaccharides, glucose, galactose and fucose were noted. In comparison, gorilla milk has a low fat content of 13.8 g kg(-1), but contains high levels of oligosaccha rides at 7.0 g kg(-1) milk. The hominoid partner, the white handed gibbon, contains no oligosaccha rides and a milk fat content similar to other hominoid species. Differences between vervet monkey and rhesus macaque milks were observed in the electrophoretic pattern of the milk proteins, mainly amongst the kappa- and gamma-caseins, which also differ from that of the hominids. The fatty acid contents of these milks differ from studies where a natural diet of leafy material was available in that a low content of alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) was noted. A phylogenetic effect is observed for the content of 8:0, 10:0 fatty acids between the Cercopithecidae and Hominoidea, and a further phylogenetic effect suggested between the Hylobatidae and Hominidae.

Elucidating Population Histories Using Genomic DNA Sequences,"['Vigilant, L']",CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1086/592025,APR 2009,2,"In 1993, Cliff Jolly suggested that rather than debating species definitions and classifications, energy would be better spent investigating multidimensional patterns of variation and gene flow among populations. Until now, however, genetic studies of wild primate populations have been limited to very small portions of the genome. Access to complete genome sequences of humans, chimpanzees, macaques, and other primates makes it possible to design studies surveying substantial amounts of DNA sequence variation at multiple genetic loci in representatives of closely related but distinct wild primate populations. Such data can be analyzed with new approaches that estimate not only when populations diverged but also the relative amounts and directions of subsequent gene flow. These analyses will reemphasize the difficulty of achieving consistent species and subspecies definitions by revealing the extent of variation in the amount and duration of gene flow accompanying population divergences."
Multiple changes in sialic acid biology during human evolution,"['Varki, A']",GLYCOCONJUGATE JOURNAL,10.1007/s10719-008-9183-z,APR 2009,79,"Humans are genetically very similar to ""great apes"", (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans), our closest evolutionary relatives. We have discovered multiple genetic and biochemical differences between humans and these other hominids, in relation to sialic acids and in Siglecs (Sia-recognizing Ig superfamily lectins). An inactivating mutation in the CMAH gene eliminated human expression of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) a major sialic acid in ""great apes"". Additional human-specific changes have been found, affecting at least 10 of the < 60 genes known to be involved in the biology of sialic acids. There are potential implications for unique features of humans, as well as for human susceptibility or resistance to disease. Additionally, metabolic incorporation of Neu5Gc from animal-derived materials occurs into biotherapeutic molecules and cellular preparations - and into human tissues from dietary sources, particularly red meat and milk products. As humans also have varying and sometime high levels of circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies, there are implications for biotechnology products, and for some human diseases associated with chronic inflammation."
Temporal Variation in Insect-eating by Chimpanzees and Gorillas in Southeast Cameroon: Extension of Niche Differentiation,"['Deblauwe, I']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-009-9337-2,APR 2009,18,"I studied insect-foraging strategies of great apes and aimed to define niche differentiation in their insect diet. I investigated seasonality in fruit-, foliage-, insect-, and meat-eating by great apes in southeast Cameroon via indirect methods and measured activity and nest densities of insect prey. I used a multinomial logistic regression to analyze the data. Gorilla and chimpanzee insect-, ant-, and termite-eating does not correlate with rainfall. Ant- and nonwinged termite-eating by chimpanzees increased in periods of succulent fruit scarcity and provided protein and energy, which might have compensated for the protein-low foliage eaten then. The apes ate winged termites when succulent fruit was abundant. Ant and winged termite consumption by gorillas correlates positively with that of chimpanzees. Ant-eating by gorillas increased when fruit was scarce, but was also associated with temporal ant activity and nest density. Both ape species also encountered more ant nests and trails in that period, as they predominantly foraged for herbs in vegetation types with high ant availability. In contrast, fruit-eating correlates positively with nonwinged termite-eating by gorillas, but again temporal prey availability is also associated. Termites might have provided 1) supplemental iron when tannin-rich fruits were eaten or 2) antidiarrheal properties when gorillas ate too much laxative fruit. Termite-eating by both ape species is not associated with spatial termite availability. In conclusion, there is niche differentiation in their insect diet. Based on the trade-off between foraging effort and nutritional gain, chimpanzees use a high-energy and gorillas a low-energy strategy when feeding on termites, but both use a low-energy strategy when feeding on ants. However, more information on the consumption of ant larvae is necessary to define niche differentiation in their ant diet."
"Nesting Behavior of Gorilla gorilla diehli at Kagwene Mountain, Cameroon: Implications for Assessing Group Size and Density","['Sunderland-Groves, JL', 'Ekinde, A', 'Mboh, H']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-009-9340-7,APR 2009,9,"We recorded nesting data at 569 fresh night nest sites, comprising 7032 individual nests, of Cross River gorillas inhabiting the Kagwene Mountain in western Cameroon. The mean night nest group size was 12.4. Overall, 55% of night nests were constructed on the ground and 45% in trees. Significantly more arboreal nests were constructed in the wet season (69%), vs. the dry season (19%). Day nest construction was common at Kagwene (n = 260 nest sites, mean nest group size = 5.98) and we encountered significantly more day nest sites in the wet season. Nest site reuse was also common (35%), though not related to season. Our results of nesting habits concur with those from other western gorilla studies, in which rainfall influences arboreal nesting. However, we encountered wet season arboreal nesting, day nest construction, and overall nest site reuse more frequently than reported for other sites. Our observations have considerable implications when estimating group size and density using traditional nest count data. The gorillas at Kagwene inhabit the highest altitudinal range of all Cross River gorilla subpopulations and rainfall is also high; therefore other subpopulations may demonstrate different nesting characteristics. However, one should consider our findings when attempting to estimate Cross River gorilla density at other localities through nest site data."

This technique is based on three-dimensional surface measurements utilizing a white-light confocal profiler and scale-sensitive fractal analysis. Data were recorded for six texture variables previously used successfully to distinguish between living primates with known dietary differences. Statistical analyses revealed that the archaeolemurids and megalaclapids have overlapping microwear texture signatures, suggesting that the two families occasionally depended on resources with similar mechanical properties. Even so. moderate variation in most attributes is evident, and results Suggest potential differences in the foods consumed by the two families. The microwear pattern for the megalaclapids indicates a preference for tougher foods, such as many leaves, while that of the archaeolemurids is consistent with the consumption of harder foods. The results also indicate some intraspecific differences among taxa within each family. This evidence suggests that the archaeolemurids and megalaclapids, like many living primates, likely consumed a variety of food types. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Using genetics to understand the dynamics of wild primate populations,"['Vigilant, L', 'Guschanski, K']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-008-0124-z,APR 2009,13,"While much can be learned about primates by means of observation, the slow life history of many primates means that even decades of dedicated effort cannot illuminate long-term evolutionary processes. For example, while the size of a contemporary population can be estimated from field censuses, it is often desirable to know whether a population has been constant or changing in size over a time frame of hundreds or thousands of years. Even the nature of ""a population"" is open to question, and the extent to which individuals successfully disperse among defined populations is also difficult to estimate by using observational methods alone. Researchers have thus turned to genetic methods to examine the size, structure, and evolutionary histories of primate populations. Many results have been gained by study of sequence variation of maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, but in recent years researchers have been increasingly focusing on analysis of short, highly variable microsatellite segments in the autosomal genome for a high-resolution view of evolutionary processes involving both sexes. In this review we describe some of the insights thus gained, and discuss the likely impact on this field of new technologies such as high-throughput DNA sequencing."
"Interaction studies in Japanese primatology: their scope, uniqueness, and the future","['Nakamura, M']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-009-0133-6,APR 2009,1,"This paper aims to review social interaction studies in Japanese primatology, in order to introduce their utility into the current framework of primatology and their potential for understanding primate sociality. In the first part, I introduce some of the achievements in the field of Japanese primatology. It is a well-known fact that Japanese primatology, in its initial phases, strongly focused on society and sociality in nonhuman primates with respect to human society and sociality. Although Jun'ichiro Itani's theory on the evolution of social structure significantly influenced some of the Japanese primatologists, it had a comparatively minor impact on the West. As Itani himself admitted, he only treated the so-called ""hardware"" of society and did not deal with its ""software"" comprehensively, although he understood its importance and even provided some insightful ideas. In the latter part of the paper, I introduce some of the studies that directly dealt with the social interactions of primates and that were written mostly in Japanese. As compared to works in standard primatology, many of these papers were descriptive. This is because interaction cannot be decomposed into individual behaviors; thus, we have to focus on interaction itself. Finally, I argue that we need to explore the methodology for describing the lively and dynamic aspects of primate sociality."
Effect of giving birth on the cortisol level in a bonobo groups' (Pan paniscus) saliva,"['Behringer, V', 'Clauss, W', 'Hachenburger, K', 'Kuchar, A', 'Mostl, E', 'Selzer, D']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-008-0121-2,APR 2009,8,"This study documents the cortisol levels in the saliva of a bonobo group, especially that of a bonobo female which had given birth for the first time. During a long study in Zoological Garden Frankfurt, Germany, a bonobo baby was born on 3 August 2007. Due to the fission-fusion keeping system employed, the bonobos were divided into two groups on this day. Their behavior was observed regularly and saliva was also collected. The bonobos had been trained to chew cotton wool and to give back the samples. The cortisol response was tested twice a day before birth and three times on the day of parturition. Before birth, no observable indication behavior was seen, but an increase in the cortisol concentration of the expectant mother was found. Parturition occurred at 8 pm. The next morning, the group with the newborn was visibly more active, which correlated with the fact that their cortisol levels were increased in the morning in comparison to the second group. During the day, cortisol decreased in both groups, only it was higher throughout the day in the new mother. In the evening, the two groups showed nearly the same cortisol levels. These data indicate that there is indeed a relation between observable behavior and the cortisol level in bonobo saliva. Therefore, the cortisol level can be regarded as a suitable indicator for verifying behavioral events."
Gorillas' (Gorilla gorilla) use of experimenter-given manual and facial cues in an object-choice task,"['Byrnit, JT']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-008-0200-1,MAR 2009,10,"Several experiments have been performed to examine the great apes' use of experimenter-given manual and visual cues in object-choice tasks. Considering their use of referential gestures in gaze-following paradigms, great apes perform surprisingly unsuccessfully in object-choice tasks. However, the large majority of object-choice experiments have been conducted with chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with very few experiments including other great ape species, making it difficult to generalize about the great apes. Interestingly, the only object-choice task conducted with gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) has indicated successful use of both manual and visual cues. It was the aim of the present study to gather more data on gorillas' use of human manual and facial cues on the object-choice task. Gorilla subjects in this study did not show consistent use of three types of referential cues."

Automatic annular laser trapping: a system for high-throughput sperm analysis and sorting,"['Shi, L', 'Shao, B', 'Chen, T', 'Berns, M']",JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS,10.1002/jbio.200910053,MAR 2009,5,"An automatic microscope system is designed to study the response of sperm motility to an annular laser trap. A continuous annular laser trap provides a parallel way to analyze and sort sperm based on their motility and to study the effects of laser radiation, optical force and external obstacles. In the described automatic microscope system, the phase contrast images of swimming sperm are digitized to the computer at video rates. The microscope stage is controlled in real-time to relocate the sperm of interest to the annular trap with a normal or tangential entering angle. The sperm is continuously tracked and the swimming behavior is identified. Using this system, parallel sorting on human and gorilla sperm are achieved and threshold power levels separating the ""fast"" group and the ""slow"" group are compared for those two species."
First contact: Understanding the relationship between hominoid incisor curvature and diet,"['Deane, A', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2009.01.006,MAR 2009,9,"Accurately interpreting fossil primate dietary behaviour is necessary to fully understand a species' ecology and connection to its environment. Traditional methods developed to infer diet from hominoid teeth successfully group taxa into broad dietary categories (i.e., folivore, frugivore) but often fail to represent the range of dietary variability characteristic of living apes. This oversimplification is not only a consequence of poor resolution, but may also reflect the use of similar fallback resources by closely related taxa with dissimilar diets. This study demonstrates that additional dietary specificity can be achieved using a morphometric approach to hominoid incisor curvature. High-resolution polynomial curve fitting (HR-PCF) was used to quantify the incisor curvatures of closely related hominoid taxa that have dissimilar diets but similar morphological adaptations to specific keystone resources (e.g., Gorilla gorilla beringei vs. G. g. gorilla). Given the key role of incisors in food processing, it is reasonable to assume that these teeth will be at least partially influenced by the unique selective pressures imposed by the mechanical loading specific to individual diets. Results from this study identify a strong correlation between hominoid dietary proportions and incisor linear dimensions and curvature, indicating that more pronounced incisor curvature is positively correlated with higher levels of frugivory. Hard-object frugivores have the greatest mesiodistal and cervico-incisal curvature and dedicated folivores have the least curved incisors. Mixed folivore/frugivores are morphological intermediates between dedicated folivores and hard- and soft-object frugivores. Mesiodistal curvature varied only in the degree of curvature; however, cervico-incisal curvature was shown to differ qualitatively between more frugivorous and more falivorous taxa. In addition to identifying a greater range of dietary variability among hominoids, this study also demonstrates that HR-PCF is capable of identifying morphological distinctions between closely related taxa with overlapping diets that rely on similar fallback foods (e.g., Pan paniscus vs. P. troglodytes).

Early Miocene catarrhine dietary behaviour: the influence of the Red Queen Effect on incisor shape and curvature,"['Deane, AS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.09.007,MAR 2009,13,"The early Miocene catarrhine fossil record of East Africa represents a diverse and extensive adaptive radiation. It is well accepted that these taxa encompass a dietary range similar to extant hominoids, in addition to some potentially novel dietary behaviour. There have been numerous attempts to infer diet for these taxa, from patterns of dental allometry and incisor and molar microwear, however, morphometric analyses until now have been restricted to the post-canine dentition. It has already been demonstrated that given the key functional role of the incisors in pre-processing food items prior to mastication, there is a positive correlation between diet and incisal curvature (Deane, A.S., Kremer, E.P., Begun, D.R., 2005. A new approach to quantifying anatomical curvatures using High Resolution Polynomial Curve Fitting (HR-PCF). Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 128(3), 630-638.; Deane, A.S., 2007. Inferring dietary behaviour for Miocene hominoids: A high-resolution morphometric approach to incisal crown curvature. Ph.D. Dissertation. The University of Toronto.). This study seeks to re-examine existing dietary hypotheses for large-bodied early Miocene fossil catarrhines by contrasting the incisal curvature for these taxa with comparative models derived from prior studies of the correlation between extant hominoid incisor curvature and feeding behaviour. Incisor curvature was quantified for 78 fossil incisors representing seven genera, and the results confirm that early Miocene fossil catarrhines represent a dietary continuum ranging from more folivorous (i.e., Rangwapithecus) to more frugivorous (i.e., Proconsul) diets, as well as novel dietary behaviours that are potentially similar to extant ceboids (i.e., Afropithecus). Additionally, early Miocene fossil catarrhine incisors are less curved than extant hominoid incisors, indicating a general pattern of increasing mesio-distal and labial curvature through time. This pattern of morphological shifting is consistent with the Red Queen Effect (Van Valen, L, 1973. A new evolutionary law. Evol. Theory 1, 1-30), which predicts that taxa that are removed from one another by geological time, although potentially having similar diets, may exhibit differing degrees of a similar dietary adaptation (i.e., differing degrees of incisal curvature).

"Food choices of the mountain gorilla in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda: the influence of nutrients, phenolics and availability","['Ganas, J', 'Ortmann, S', 'Robbins, MM']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,10.1017/S0266467408005701,MAR 2009,6,"The factors that influence food choice have implications for animal survival. reproduction and population growth. We conducted a 1-y study of food choice by four mountain gorilla groups that consumed herbs and fruit at 14 two locations differing spatially and temporally in food availability in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Uganda. We collected data on 45 important foods consumed by the gorillas, the availability of those foods in each gorilla 14 group's home range and their corresponding nutrient and phenolic concentrations. Employing a linear multiple regression, we tested three hypotheses regarding the influence of food availability and the nutritional and phenolic 14 concentrations of food on food choice. Regardless of changes in herb availability, the choice of herbs was positively influenced by their abundance and Sugar concentrations and negatively influenced by their fibre, condensed tannin and protein concentrations. Furthermore, regardless of changes in fruit availability, the choice of fruit was positively influenced by its abundance and negatively influenced by its condensed tannin concentrations. During periods of low fruit availability, the gorillas did not increase the consumption of herbs high in fibre and sugar. The choice of herbs low in fibre had less of an influence on food choice at the location with lower fruit availability than the other location. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating both availability and nutrient concentrations into studies of food choice: by doing so we found Bwindi gorillas were able to choose abundant, relatively high-quality foods year round."
Implications of body mass and predation for ape social system and biogeographical distribution,"['Lehmann, J', 'Dunbar, R']",OIKOS,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2008.16382.x,MAR 2009,10,"Despite the fact that all African great apes have overlapping diets, they differ substantially in both biogeographical distribution and social organisation: Gorilla lives in relatively small, cohesive groups within a small biogeographical area while Pan is much more widely distributed and lives in large, fluid groups in which the members are rarely all together. In this study we use a modelling approach to identify possible causes and consequences of these differences. We use a time budget model which is based on the relationship between time available for various activities, group size, body mass and climate. We demonstrate the importance of body mass as a critical determinant for maximum ecologically tolerable group size as well as ape distribution patterns. In addition, we show that predation pressure may play a strong role in limiting the distribution of smaller-bodied apes (Pan). Predation pressure appears to be especially important if the apes opt for a fission-fusion strategy because it obliges them to maintain larger (sub-) groups. In effect, the apes appear to face a tradeoff between solving the predation problem by increasing body size (at the expense of reduced ecological flexibility) and going for ecological flexibility (but at some cost in terms of how they handle predation)."
"The chalicothere Metaschizotherium bavaricum (Perissodactyla, Chalicotheriidae, Schizotheriinae) from the Miocene (MN5) Lagerstatte of Sandelzhausen (Germany): description, comparison, and paleoecological significance","['Coombs, MC', 'FAUNA']",PALAEONTOLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT,10.1007/s12542-009-0004-x,MAR 2009,10,"Within the fossil collection from the Sandelzhausen Lagerstatte in the Upper Freshwater Molasse near Mainburg, Germany, are remains of the schizotheriine chalicothere Metaschizotherium bavaricum, von Koenigswald, 1932. This new material includes elements from a large part of the body, and allows the dentition and postcranial skeleton of Metaschizotherium to be described in detail for the first time. At approximately 16 Ma (MN5), M. bavaricum is now the best-known Early and Middle Miocene European schizotheriine and is important for comparative studies. It differs to some degree from earlier Miocene (MN2-MN4) European material attributed to Moropus sp. or Metaschizotherium wetzleri (Kowalewsky, 1873) and to a larger degree from the Late Miocene species Ancylotherium pentelicum (Gaudry and Lartet, 1856). At Sandelzhausen, M. bavaricum apparently lived in a moist forested environment, where it probably fed on leaves, fruit, and seeds. Members of the Chalicotheriinae, such as Anisodon and Chalicotherium, are not found at Sandelzhausen and may not have been present in Europe at this time. M. bavaricum, like other Schizotheriinae, did not have the bizarre gorilla-like proportions of the Chalicotheriinae. Instead, its general body proportions resemble those of contemporary schizotheriine chalicotheres on other continents, for example, Moropus from North America. M. bavaricum is slightly smaller than the type species of Metaschizotherium, M. fraasi von Koenigswald, 1932 (MN6-MN7) and differs from it in small ways that are still being explored as variation within and differences between these species are clarified. The schizotheriine chalicothere from La Grive St.-Alban (France) referred to M. fraasi by von Koenigswald (Palaeontographica, Beitrage zur Naturgeschichte der Vorzeit 8:1-24, 1932) and Viret (Nouvelles Archives Mus,e d'Histoire Naturelle de Lyon 6:53-81, 1961) should be restudied and referred to a different taxon."
Facility Design for Bachelor Gorilla Groups,"['Coe, JC', 'Scott, D', 'Lukas, KE']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20233,MAR-APR 2009,5,"This paper emerged from discussions following the Bachelor Gorilla 2000 Workshop Facility Design sessions. Although many ape facility design features are common to all gorillas, the purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of special needs of bachelor gorillas. For example, managing escalating aggression between maturing or silverback males may require a high degree of caregiver intervention and thus easy access to gorillas both on- and off-exhibit is beneficial. Facility design features that reduce contact aggression, increase affiliation, provide visual barriers or escape routes, and allow safe outlets for species-typical behavior are essential to the successful management of bachelor gorilla groups in zoos. Such provisions permit caregivers the ability to constantly monitor and modify the zoo environment to meet rapidly changing husbandry needs. Creatively designed habitats and continuing research on bachelor group dynamics will undoubtedly allow zoo managers to maintain all gorilla groups in an environmental and social context that enhances well-being over the long term.

SPECIES-SPECIFIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF TYROSINE HYDROXYLASE-IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX OF ANTHROPOID PRIMATES,"['Raghanti, MA', 'Spocter, MA', 'Stimpson, CD', 'Erwin, JM', 'Bonar, CJ', 'Allman, JM', 'Hof, PR', 'Sherwood, CC']",NEUROSCIENCE,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.10.058,FEB 18 2009,12,"In this study, we assessed the distribution of cortical neurons immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) In prefrontal cortical regions of humans and nonhuman primate species. Immunohistochemical methods were used to visualize TH-immunoreactive (TH-ir) neurons in areas 9 (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and 32 (anterior paracingulate cortex). The study sample Included humans, great apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan), one lesser ape (slamang), and Old World monkeys (golden guenon, patas monkey, olive baboon, moor macaque, black and white colobus, and Francois' langur). The percentage of neurons within the cortex expressing TH was quantified using computer-assisted stereology. TH-ir neurons were present in layers V and VI and the subjacent white matter in each of the Old World monkey species, the siamang, and in humans. TH-ir cells were also occasionally observed in layer III of human, siamang, baboon, colobus, and Francois' langur cortex. Cortical cells expressing TH were notably absent In each of the great ape species. Quantitative analyses did not reveal a phylogenetic trend for percentage of TH-ir neurons in these cortical areas among species. Interestingly, humans and monkey species exhibited a bilaminar pattern of TH-ir axon distributions within prefrontal regions, with layers I-II and layers V-VI having the densest contingent of axons. In contrast, the great apes had a different pattern of laminar innervation, with a remarkably denser distribution of TH-ir axons within layer Ill. It is possible that the catecholaminergic afferent input to layer Ill in chimpanzees and other great apes covaries with loss of TH-ir cells within the cortical mantle. (C) 2009 IBRO.

Origin and Biology of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus in Wild-Living Western Gorillas,"['Takehisa, J', 'Kraus, MH', 'Ayouba, A', 'Bailes, E', 'Van Heuverswyn, F', 'Decker, JM', 'Li, Y', 'Rudicell, RS', 'Learn, GH', 'Neel, C', 'Ngole, EM', 'Shaw, GM', 'Peeters, M', 'Sharp, PM', 'Hahn, BH']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.02311-08,FEB 15 2009,66,"Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) are infected with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVgor) that is closely related to chimpanzee and human immunodeficiency viruses (SIVcpz and HIV-1, respectively) in west central Africa. Although existing data suggest a chimpanzee origin for SIVgor, a paucity of available sequences has precluded definitive conclusions. Here, we report the molecular characterization of one partial (BQ664) and three full-length (CP684, CP2135, and CP2139) SIVgor genomes amplified from fecal RNAs of wild-living gorillas at two field sites in Cameroon. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all SIVgor strains clustered together, forming a monophyletic lineage throughout their genomes. Interestingly, the closest relatives of SIVgor were not SIVcpzPtt strains from west central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) but human viruses belonging to HIV-1 group O. In trees derived from most genomic regions, SIVgor and HIV-1 group O formed a sister clade to the SIVcpzPtt lineage. However, in a tree derived from 5' pol sequences (similar to 900 bp), SIVgor and HIV-1 group O fell within the SIVcpzPtt radiation. The latter was due to two SIVcpzPtt strains that contained mosaic pol sequences, pointing to the existence of a divergent SIVcpzPtt lineage that gave rise to SIVgor and HIV-1 group O. Gorillas appear to have acquired this lineage at least 100 to 200 years ago. To examine the biological properties of SIVgor, we synthesized a full-length provirus from fecal consensus sequences. Transfection of the resulting clone (CP2139.287) into 293T cells yielded infectious virus that replicated efficiently in both human and chimpanzee CD4(+) T cells and used CCR5 as the coreceptor for viral entry. Together, these results provide strong evidence that P. t. troglodytes apes were the source of SIVgor. These same apes may also have spawned the group O epidemic; however, the possibility that gorillas served as an intermediary host cannot be excluded."
A burst of segmental duplications in the genome of the African great ape ancestor,"['Marques-Bonet, T', 'Kidd, JM', 'Ventura, M', 'Graves, TA', 'Cheng, Z', 'Hillier, LW', 'Jiang, ZS', 'Baker, C', 'Malfavon-Borja, R', 'Fulton, LA', 'Alkan, C', 'Aksay, G', 'Girirajan, S', 'Siswara, P', 'Chen, L', 'Cardone, MF', 'Navarro, A', 'Mardis, ER', 'Wilson, RK', 'Eichler, EE']",NATURE,10.1038/nature07744,FEB 12 2009,101,"It is generally accepted that the extent of phenotypic change between human and great apes is dissonant with the rate of molecular change(1). Between these two groups, proteins are virtually identical(1,2), cytogenetically there are few rearrangements that distinguish ape - human chromosomes(3), and rates of single- base- pair change(4-7) and retrotransposon activity(8-10) have slowed particularly within hominid lineages when compared to rodents or monkeys. Studies of gene family evolution indicate that gene loss and gain are enriched within the primate lineage(11,12). Here, we perform a systematic analysis of duplication content of four primate genomes ( macaque, orang- utan, chimpanzee and human) in an effort to understand the pattern and rates of genomic duplication during hominid evolution. We find that the ancestral branch leading to human and African great apes shows the most significant increase in duplication activity both in terms of base pairs and in terms of events. This duplication acceleration within the ancestral species is significant when compared to lineage- specific rate estimates even after accounting for copy- number polymorphism and homoplasy. We discover striking examples of recurrent and independent gene- containing duplications within the gorilla and chimpanzee that are absent in the human lineage. Our results suggest that the evolutionary properties of copy- number mutation differ significantly from other forms of genetic mutation and, in contrast to the hominid slowdown of single- base- pair mutations, there has been a genomic burst of duplication activity at this period during human evolution."

GOrilla: a tool for discovery and visualization of enriched GO terms in ranked gene lists","['Eden, E', 'Navon, R', 'Steinfeld, I', 'Lipson, D', 'Yakhini, Z']",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,10.1186/1471-2105-10-48,FEB 3 2009,524,"Background: Since the inception of the GO annotation project, a variety of tools have been developed that support exploring and searching the GO database. In particular, a variety of tools that perform GO enrichment analysis are currently available. Most of these tools require as input a target set of genes and a background set and seek enrichment in the target set compared to the background set. A few tools also exist that support analyzing ranked lists. The latter typically rely on simulations or on union-bound correction for assigning statistical significance to the results.

Results: GOrilla is a web-based application that identifies enriched GO terms in ranked lists of genes, without requiring the user to provide explicit target and background sets. This is particularly useful in many typical cases where genomic data may be naturally represented as a ranked list of genes (e. g. by level of expression or of differential expression). GOrilla employs a flexible threshold statistical approach to discover GO terms that are significantly enriched at the top of a ranked gene list. Building on a complete theoretical characterization of the underlying distribution, called mHG, GOrilla computes an exact p-value for the observed enrichment, taking threshold multiple testing into account without the need for simulations. This enables rigorous statistical analysis of thousand of genes and thousands of GO terms in order of seconds. The output of the enrichment analysis is visualized as a hierarchical structure, providing a clear view of the relations between enriched GO terms.

Conclusion: GOrilla is an efficient GO analysis tool with unique features that make a useful addition to the existing repertoire of GO enrichment tools. GOrilla's unique features and advantages over other threshold free enrichment tools include rigorous statistics, fast running time and an effective graphical representation.

Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) Change Their Activity Patterns in Response to Frugivory,"['Masi, S', 'Cipolletta, C', 'Robbins, MM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20629,FEB 2009,41,"The most important environmental factor explaining interspecies variation in ecology and sociality of the great apes is likely to be variation in resource availability. Relatively little is known about the activity patterns of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), which inhabit a dramatically different environment from the well-studied mountain gorillas (G. beringei beringei). This study aims to provide a detailed quantification of western lowland gorillas' activity budgets using direct observations on one habituated group in Bai Hokou, Central African Republic. We examined how activity patterns of both sexes are shaped by seasonal frugivory. Activity was recorded with 5-min instantaneous sampling between December 2004 and December 2005. During the high-frugivory period the gorillas spent less time feeding and more time traveling than during the low-frugivory period. The silverback spent less time feeding but more time resting than both females and immatures, which likely results from a combination of social and physiological factors. When compared with mountain gorillas, western lowland gorillas spend more time feeding (67 vs. 55%) and traveling (12 vs. 6.5%), but less time resting (21 vs. 34%) and engaging in social/other activities (0.5 vs. 3.6%). This disparity in activity budgets of western lowland gorillas and mountain gorillas may be explained by the more frugivorous diet and the greater dispersion of food resources experienced by western lowland gorillas. Like other apes, western lowland gorillas change their activity patterns in response to changes in the diet. Am. J. Primatol. 71:91-100, 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Comparison of life-history patterns of closely related species living in diverse environments helps to evaluate the validity of these assumptions but empirical data are lacking. The two gorilla species exhibit substantial differences in their environment, which allows investigation into the role of increased frugivory in shaping western gorilla life histories. We present behavioral and morphological data on western gorilla physical maturation and life-history parameters from a 12.5-year study at Mbeli Bai, a forest clearing in the Nouabale-Ndoki National Park in northern Congo. We assign photographs of known individuals to different life-history classes and propose new age boundaries for life-history classes in western gorillas, which can be used and tested at other western gorilla research sites. Our results show that western gorillas are weaned at a later age compared with mountain gorillas and indicate slower physical maturation of immatures. These findings support the risk-aversion hypothesis for more frugivorous species. However, our methods need to be applied and tested with other gorilla populations. The slow life histories of western gorillas could have major consequences for social structure, mortality patterns and population growth rates that will affect recovery from population crashes of this critically endangered species. We emphasize that long-term studies can provide crucial demographic and life-history data that improve our understanding of life-history evolution and adaptation and help to refine conservation strategies.

Benefits of training/playing therapy in a group of captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Carrasco, L', 'Colell, M', 'Calvo, M', 'Abello, MT', 'Velasco, M', 'Posada, S']",ANIMAL WELFARE,NA,FEB 2009,9,"Animal well-being and enrichment continue to gain importance in the maintenance of primates living in captivity. Positive reinforcement training (PRT) and/or playing interaction have been shown to be effective in improving the well-being of several species of primates. This research study evaluated the effects of applying a combination of these two techniques (training/playing therapy) on a group of lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). The effects of this combination on the behaviour of captive primates have been given very little attention to date, The behaviour of a group of seven females was recorded in two different phases at Barcelona Zoo: before (periods I and 2) and after (periods 3 and 4) a series of changes were made to the composition of this social group. In each period, two phases were distinguished: i) baseline condition, after the subjects became used to the researcher, focal recordings were made of the group's regular behaviour and, ii) experimental condition, the training and playing sessions ('gorilla play') with two specific subjects began one hour before the group went to the outdoor facility. The frequency and duration of the behaviour observed in each of the recording conditions were compared. The results showed positive changes in the gorillas' behaviour. stereotypies, interactions with the public, aggression between subjects and inactivity were all reduced, while affiliative behaviour and individual and social play-related behaviour increased. Moreover, the benefits of this therapy were observed in trained individuals and the rest of the gorillas in the group, which would seem to indicate that training/playing can be used to create a more relaxed atmosphere, reducing social tension and improving the well-being of all the subjects involved."
Socioecological influences on the dispersal of female mountain gorillas-evidence of a second folivore paradox,"['Robbins, AM', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Fawcett, KA', 'Robbins, MM']",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,10.1007/s00265-008-0679-0,FEB 2009,21,"Socioecological models indicate that the group structure and female dispersal patterns of primates are determined primarily by the abundance and distribution of food, predation pressures, and infanticide risks. In response to those influences, females of folivorous primates are considered relatively free to disperse into groups with the optimal size and structure. Yet some folivores live in small groups despite a potentially higher risk of predation, an apparent inconsistency known as the folivore paradox. This paper examines the female dispersal of a folivorous primate, the Virunga mountain gorillas. Mountain gorillas currently have no natural predators, but this species presents a different version of the folivore paradox: why do 50-60% of females reside in smaller one-male groups despite a higher risk of infanticide? In this study, females left one-male groups more frequently than multimale groups, but transfer destinations were not consistently biased toward multimale groups and those groups did not have higher immigration rates. We found no evidence of dispersal to avoid feeding competition within large groups, even as they have become three to five times larger than average. Thus, the lack of a consistent bias toward multimale groups was not because they are typically larger than one-male groups. Instead, the apparent inconsistencies may reflect limited female transfer opportunities, other influences on dispersal, and possibly an evolutionary disequilibrium in which current behavior does not optimize fitness."
"Counting elusive animals: Comparing field and genetic census of the entire mountain gorilla population of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda","['Guschanski, K', 'Vigilant, L', 'McNeilage, A', 'Gray, M', 'Kagoda, E', 'Robbins, MM']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2008.10.024,FEB 2009,46,"Accurate population size estimates are an essential part of every effective management plan for conserving endangered species. However, censusing rare and elusive wild animals is challenging and often relies on counting indirect signs, such as nests or feces. Despite widespread use, the accuracy of such estimates has rarely been evaluated. Here we compare an estimate of population size derived solely from field data with that obtained from a combination of field and genetic data for the critically endangered population of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. After genotyping DNA from 384 fecal samples at 16 microsatellite loci, the population size estimate was reduced by 10.1% to 302 individuals, compared with 336 gorillas estimated using the traditional nest-count based method alone. We found that both groups and lone silverbacks were double-counted in the field and that individuals constructed multiple nests with an overall rate of 7.8%, resulting in the overestimation of the population size in the absence of genetic data. Since the error associated with the traditional field method exceeded the estimated population growth of 5% in the last 4 years, future genetic censusing will be needed to determine how the population size is changing. This study illustrates that newly improved molecular methods allow fast, efficient and relatively affordable genotyping of several hundred samples, suggesting that genetic censusing can be widely applied to provide accurate and reliable population size estimates for a wide variety of species.

Great apes' capacities to recognize relational similarity,"['Haun, DBM', 'Call, J']",COGNITION,10.1016/j.cognition.2008.10.012,FEB 2009,21,"Recognizing relational similarity relies on the ability to understand that defining object properties might not lie in the objects individually, but in the relations of the properties of various object to each other. This aptitude is highly relevant for many important human skills such as language, reasoning, categorization and understanding analogy and metaphor. In the current study, we investigated the ability to recognize relational similarities by testing five species of great apes, including human children in a spatial task. We found that all species performed better if related elements are connected by logico-causal as opposed to non-causal relations. Further, we find that only children above 4 years of age, bonobos and chimpanzees, unlike younger children, gorillas and orangutans display some mastery of reasoning by non-causal relational similarity. We conclude that recognizing relational similarity is not in its entirety unique to the human species. The lack of a capability for language does not prohibit recognition of simple relational similarities. The data are discussed in the light of the phylogenetic tree of relatedness of the great apes.

Surprisingly, although chimpanzees are our closest evolutionary relatives, the major cause of heart disease is different in the two species. Histopathology data of affected chimpanzee hearts from two primate centers, and analysis of literature indicate that sudden death in chimpanzees (and in gorillas and orangutans) is commonly associated with diffuse interstitial myocardial fibrosis of unknown cause. In contrast, most human heart disease results from coronary artery atherosclerosis, which occludes myocardial blood supply, causing ischemic damage. The typical myocardial infarction of humans due to coronary artery thrombosis is rare in these apes, despite their human-like coronary-risk-prone blood lipid profiles. Instead, chimpanzee 'heart attacks' are likely due to arrythmias triggered by myocardial fibrosis. Why do humans not often suffer from the fibrotic heart disease so common in our closest evolutionary cousins? Conversely, why do chimpanzees not have the kind of heart disease so common in humans? The answers could be of value to medical care, as well as to understanding human evolution. A preliminary attempt is made to explore possibilities at the histological level, with a focus on glycosylation changes."
"Variation over Time in Parasite Prevalence Among Free-ranging Chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, Tanzania","['Bakuza, JS', 'Nkwengulila, G']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-008-9329-7,FEB 2009,13,"From January to September, 2005, we collected fecal samples from 60 chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, Tanzania and examined them for parasites. We compared current parasite prevalence data with previous studies to obtain a pattern of parasitism over time. There were considerable similarities in the parasite species composition and prevalence, although we noted some variations. Generally, parasite prevalence decreased over time, with the present prevalence being lower than in previous surveys. We identified 8 types of parasites, all of which had previously been documented in the chimpanzees of Gombe. Three nematodes - Oesophagostomum sp., Strongyloides fulleborni, and Abbreviata caucassica- occurred at higher prevalence (41.2-45.5%) but relatively lower than previous findings of 50-91%. We also diagnosed unidentified strongyles at a moderate prevalence (33%), lower than a previous record of 41%. Probstmayria gombensis occurred at relatively low prevalence (16.4%) vs. past observations (23-59%), while the prevalence of Trichuris sp. (7.3%) was closely similar to previous records of 5-9%. We also observed unidentified ciliate at 9% within the same range as in previous studies (5-28%). The prevalence of Troglodytella abrassarti was 78%, closely similar to previous findings of 75%. There was no significant variation in parasite prevalence between chimpanzees of the Kasekela community and those of the Mitumba community, although the former tended to have higher prevalence of helminths than the latter. The causes of the similarities and variations in parasite prevalence over time are discussed. The study provides baseline data for monitoring of chimpanzee health at Gombe."
"Effects of Yearly Change in Nut Fruiting on Autumn Home-range Use by Macaca fuscata on Kinkazan Island, Northern Japan","['Tsuji, Y', 'Takatsuki, S']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-009-9336-3,FEB 2009,11,"Temporal changes in food availability affect foraging success and ultimately reproductive success of animals. They include both seasonal and annual changes. Although many researchers have investigated food availability and the corresponding ranging behavior of primates, studies of yearly changes have been limited. We studied the effects of the fruiting of nuts of Fagus crenata, Zelkova serrata, and Torreya nucifera on the ranging behavior of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) in autumn on Kinkazan Island, northern Japan, for 5 yr between 2000 and 2005 (excluding 2003). We divided the study area (3.3 km(2)) into 100 x 100-m quadrats to assess the distribution of nut-rich quadrats that contained high densities of nut-producing species. The home ranges of the monkeys contained more nut-rich quadrats than expected, and the difference was significant for 3 of 5 yr. Autumn home-range use was also affected by the distribution of nut production, although the effect differed by year: monkeys frequently used nut-rich quadrats in a Zelkova-year (2000) and in 1 Torreya-year (2001), whereas they nonselectively used nut-rich quadrats in 2 Fagus-years (2002 and 2005) and in another Torreya-year (2004). Thus, Japanese macaques flexibly change their autumn ranging behavior according to yearly changes in distribution of nut production."
Human Ability to Recognize Kin Visually Within Primates,"['Alvergne, A', 'Huchard, E', 'Caillaud, D', 'Charpentier, MJE', 'Setchell, JM', 'Ruppli, C', 'Fejan, D', 'Martinez, L', 'Cowlishaw, G', 'Raymond, M']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-009-9339-0,FEB 2009,9,"The assessment of relatedness is a key determinant in the evolution of social behavior in primates. Humans are able to detect kin visually in their own species using facial phenotypes, and facial resemblance in turn influences both prosocial behaviors and mating decisions. This suggests that cognitive abilities that allow facial kin detection in conspecifics have been favored in the species by kin selection. We investigated the extent to which humans are able to recognize kin visually by asking human judges to assess facial resemblance in 4 other primate species (common chimpanzees, western lowland gorillas, mandrills, and chacma baboons) on the basis of pictures of faces. Humans achieved facial interspecific kin recognition in all species except baboons. Facial resemblance is a reliable indicator of relatedness in at least chimpanzees, gorillas, and mandrills, and future work should explore if the primates themselves also share the ability to detect kin facially."
"Evolution of X-Degenerate Y Chromosome Genes in Greater Apes: Conservation of Gene Content in Human and Gorilla, But Not Chimpanzee","['Goto, H', 'Peng, L', 'Makova, KD']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-008-9189-y,FEB 2009,13,"Compared with the X chromosome, the mammalian Y chromosome is considerably diminished in size and has lost most of its ancestral genes during evolution. Interestingly, for the X-degenerate region on the Y chromosome, human has retained all 16 genes, while chimpanzee has lost 4 of the 16 genes since the divergence of the two species. To uncover the evolutionary forces governing ape Y chromosome degeneration, we determined the complete sequences of the coding exons and splice sites for 16 gorilla Y chromosome genes of the X-degenerate region. We discovered that all studied reading frames and splice sites were intact, and thus, this genomic region experienced no gene loss in the gorilla lineage. Higher nucleotide divergence was observed in the chimpanzee than the human lineage, particularly for genes with disruptive mutations, suggesting a lack of functional constraints for these genes in chimpanzee. Surprisingly, our results indicate that the human and gorilla orthologues of the genes disrupted in chimpanzee evolve under relaxed functional constraints and might not be essential. Taking mating patterns and effective population sizes of ape species into account, we conclude that genetic hitchhiking associated with positive selection due to sperm competition might explain the rapid decline in the Y chromosome gene number in chimpanzee. As we found no evidence of positive selection acting on the X-degenerate genes, such selection likely targets other genes on the chimpanzee Y chromosome."
Multigene analysis of phylogenetic relationships and divergence times of primate sucking lice (Phthiraptera: Anoplura),"['Light, JE', 'Reed, DL']",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.ympev.2008.10.023,FEB 2009,25,"Cospeciation between hosts and parasites offers a unique opportunity to use information from parasites to infer events in host evolutionary history. Although lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera) are known to cospeciate with their hosts and have frequently served as important markers to infer host evolutionary history, most molecular studies are based on only one or two markers. Resulting phylogenies may, therefore, represent gene histories (rather than species histories), and analyses of multiple molecular markers are needed to increase confidence in the results of phylogenetic analyses. Herein, we phylogenetically examine nine molecular markers in primate sucking lice (Phthiraptera: Anoplura) and we use these markers to estimate divergence times among louse lineages. Individual and combined analyses of these nine markers are, for the most part, congruent, supporting relationships hypothesized in previous studies. Only one marker, the nuclear protein-coding gene Histone 3, has a significantly different tree topology compared to the other markers. The disparate evolutionary history of this marker, however, has no significant effect on topology or nodal support in the combined phylogenetic analyses. Therefore, phylogenetic results from the combined data set likely represent a solid hypothesis of species relationships. Additionally, we find that simultaneous use of multiple markers and calibration points provides the most reliable estimates of louse divergence times, in agreement with previous studies estimating divergences among species. Estimates of phylogenies and divergence times also allow us to verify the results of [Reed, D.L., Light, J.E., Allen, J.M., Kirchman, J.J., 2007. Pair of lice lost or parasites regained: the evolutionary history of anthropoid primate lice. BMC Biol. 5, 7.]; there was probable contact between gorilla and archaic hominids roughly 3 Ma resulting in a host switch of Pthirus lice from gorillas to archaic hominids. Thus, these results provide further evidence that data from cospeciating organisms can yield important information about the evolutionary history of their hosts. Published by Elsevier Inc."
Object permanence in dogs: Invisible displacement in a rotation task,"['Miller, HC', 'Gipson, CD', 'Vaughan, A', 'Rayburn-Reeves, R', 'Zentall, TR']",PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW,10.3758/PBR.16.1.150,FEB 2009,17,"Dogs were tested for object permanence using an invisible displacement in which an object was hidden in one of two containers at either end of a beam and the beam was rotated. Consistent with earlier research, when the beam was rotated 180 degrees, the dogs failed to find the object. However, when the beam was rotated only 90, they were successful. Furthermore, when the dogs were led either 90 degrees or 180 degrees around the apparatus, they were also successful. In a control condition, when the dogs could not see the direction of the 90 degrees rotation, they failed to find the object. The results suggest that the 180 degrees rotation may produce an interfering context that can be reduced by rotating the apparatus only 90 degrees or by changing the dogs' perspective. Once the conflict is eliminated, dogs show evidence of object permanence that includes invisibly displaced objects."
Genome and gene alterations by insertions and deletions in the evolution of human and chimpanzee chromosome 22,"['Volfovsky, N', 'Oleksyk, TK', 'Cruz, KC', 'Truelove, AL', 'Stephens, RM', 'Smith, MW']",BMC GENOMICS,10.1186/1471-2164-10-51,JAN 26 2009,6,"Background: Understanding structure and function of human genome requires knowledge of genomes of our closest living relatives, the primates. Nucleotide insertions and deletions (indels) play a significant role in differentiation that underlies phenotypic differences between humans and chimpanzees. In this study, we evaluated distribution, evolutionary history, and function of indels found by comparing syntenic regions of the human and chimpanzee genomes.

Results: Specifically, we identified 6,279 indels of 10 bp or greater in a similar to 33 Mb alignment between human and chimpanzee chromosome 22. After the exclusion of those in repetitive DNA, 1,429 or 23% of indels still remained. This group was characterized according to the local or genome-wide repetitive nature, size, location relative to genes, and other genomic features. We defined three major classes of these indels, using local structure analysis: (i) those indels found uniquely without additional copies of indel sequence in the surrounding (10 Kb) region, (ii) those with at least one exact copy found nearby, and (iii) those with similar but not identical copies found locally. Among these classes, we encountered a high number of exactly repeated indel sequences, most likely due to recent duplications. Many of these indels (683 of 1,429) were in proximity of known human genes. Coding sequences and splice sites contained significantly fewer of these indels than expected from random expectations, suggesting that selection is a factor in limiting their persistence. A subset of indels from coding regions was experimentally validated and their impacts were predicted based on direct sequencing in several human populations as well as chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and two subspecies of orangutans.

Conclusion: Our analysis demonstrates that while indels are distributed essentially randomly in intergenic and intronic genomic regions, they are significantly under-represented in coding sequences. There are substantial differences in representation of indel classes among genomic elements, most likely caused by differences in their evolutionary histories. Using local sequence context, we predicted origins and phylogenetic relationships of gene-impacting indels in primate species. These results suggest that genome plasticity is a major force behind speciation events separating the great ape lineages."

Auto-validating von Neumann rejection sampling from small phylogenetic tree spaces,"['Sainudiin, R', 'York, T']",ALGORITHMS FOR MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,10.1186/1748-7188-4-1,JAN 7 2009,1,"Background: In phylogenetic inference one is interested in obtaining samples from the posterior distribution over the tree space on the basis of some observed DNA sequence data. One of the simplest sampling methods is the rejection sampler due to von Neumann. Here we introduce an auto-validating version of the rejection sampler, via interval analysis, to rigorously draw samples from posterior distributions over small phylogenetic tree spaces.

Results: The posterior samples from the auto-validating sampler are used to rigorously (i) estimate posterior probabilities for different rooted topologies based on mitochondrial DNA from human, chimpanzee and gorilla, (ii) conduct a non-parametric test of rate variation between protein-coding and tRNA-coding sites from three primates and (iii) obtain a posterior estimate of the human-neanderthal divergence time.

Conclusion: This solves the open problem of rigorously drawing independent and identically distributed samples from the posterior distribution over rooted and unrooted small tree spaces (3 or 4 taxa) based on any multiply-aligned sequence data."

Despite a substantial database, manual laterality in non-human primates remains a controversial topic. We give here a review of the main findings on manual preference in great apes. This article presents data on hand preferences for a bimanual coordination in 29 bonobos (Pan paniscus). The study aims to provide data on manual laterality for a complex bimanual task in this very interesting and rarely studied species. Hand preferences were assessed using the 'tube task'. This task has been used with other species, which allows reliable data comparisons. The task requires a bimanual Coordinated precise action: the subject holds the tube with one]land while reaching for food inside with the other hand. As a complex task, this measure has been shown to be efficient in revealing and preferences. It has revealed group-level right bias in chimpanzees. Bonobos had never been tested. We recorded both independent bouts (counting only the first pattern of a sequence of identical actions) and frequency (counting every action). The bonobos exhibited strong hand preferences. With frequency, 11 bonobos were classified as right-handed, 15 were left-handed and 3 had no preference. With bouts, 8 bonobos were right-handed, 9 were left-handed and 12 had no preference. No group-level bias appeared. The results are discussed in relation with previous findings and theories on brain lateralization. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Hepatitis B virus infection in non-human primates,"['Sa-Nguanmoo, P', 'Rianthavorn, P', 'Amornsawadwattana, S', 'Poovorawan, Y']",ACTA VIROLOGICA,10.4149/av_2009_02_73,2009,10,"Hepatitis B viruses (HBVs) represent a serious public health problem affecting 350 to 400 million HBV carriers worldwide. The virus does not exclusively infect humans, but can also be found in non-human primates as in the families Hominidae (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan) and Hylobatidae (gibbon), which are distributed over Africa (chimpanzee and gorilla) and Southeast Asia (orangutan and gibbon), the endemic areas of human HBV. The prevalence of asymptomatic HBV carriers reaches in gibbons 23-33% and in orangutans 15%. The genome organization of non-human primate HBVs is nearly identical to that of human HBVs. Because of this close similarity, the question of cross-transmission of HBV between species has arisen. There are many data on cross-transmission of human HBVs to the non-human primates. However, a cross-transmission of HBVs from non-human primates to humans has not been reported yet. Using more advanced diagnostic methods, the non-human primates have increasingly been identified as a reservoir of several viruses such as lymphocryptoviruses, Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 (CeHV-1), Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), Simian foamy virus (SFV), and HBVs. Thus veterinarians, zookeepers, or people in close contact with non-human primates may potentially become infected with those viruses causing severe diseases. Enhanced awareness of prevalence, genetic relatedness and evolution of non-human primate HBVs will help prevent further spread and cross-transmission of these viruses between humans and non-human primates."
Allometry of Facial Mobility in Anthropoid Primates: Implications for the Evolution of Facial Expression,"['Dobson, SD']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20902,JAN 2009,13,"Body size may be an important factor influencing the evolution of facial expression in anthropoid primates due to allometric constraints on the perception of facial movements. Given this hypothesis, I tested the prediction that observed facial mobility is positively correlated with body size in a comparative sample of nonhuman anthropoids. Facial mobility, or the variety of facial movements a species can produce, was estimated using a novel application of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). I used FACS to estimate facial mobility in 12 nonhuman anthropoid species, based on video recordings of facial activity in zoo animals. Body mass data were taken from the literature. I used phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) to perform a multiple regression analysis with facial mobility as the dependent variable and two independent variables: log body mass and dummy-coded infraorder. Together, body mass and infraorder explain 92% of the variance in facial mobility. However, the partial effect of body mass is much stronger than for infraorder. The results of my study suggest that allometry is an important constraint on the evolution of facial mobility, which may limit the complexity of facial expression in smaller species. More work is needed to clarify the perceptual bases of this allometric pattern. Am J Phys Anthropol 138:70-81., 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

In the majority of studies of the CT contents of primate foods, a tannin source such as ""quebracho"" is used to standardize CT assays, but the CT in quebracho tannin may not be similar to those in the plants of interest. We investigated how the choice of standard to calibrate CT assays affects the estimation of CT in the diets of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei). We purified the CT from gorilla foods and compared the actual amounts of CT in the foods with estimates produced by using the quebracho tannin. When quebracho was used, the estimates of CT contents of gorilla foods were, on average, 3.6 times the actual content of CT so that the amounts in frequently eaten gorilla foods were substantially overestimated. The overestimation for a given plant could not be predicted reliably and the ranking of plants by tannin content differed according to the standard used. Our results demonstrate that accurate measurements of CT necessitate the use of tannins purified from the plant species of interest. A reevaluation of primatology studies using interspecific comparisons of tannin content will provide new insights into primate food selection and nutritional ecology. Am. J. Primatol. 71:70-76, 2009.

Does dispersal cause reproductive delays in female mountain gorillas?,"['Robbins, AM', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Fawcett, KA', 'Robbins, MM']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/156853909X426354,2009,8,"Reproductive delays are a potential cost of dispersal, even when females transfer directly from one social unit to another. Delays may occur before a transfer if females avoid conception while waiting to encounter other groups, and delays following the transfer could be caused by greater stress or poorer nutrition in the new group. This paper examines the timing of reproduction and inter-group transfers of female mountain gorillas in the Virunga Volcano region in Africa. Reproductive delays were not observed for nulliparous females, who typically transfer more than a year before their first conception. For parous females, interbirth intervals were significantly longer when they contained a transfer, but limited observations did not suggest that females were avoiding conception while waiting to transfer, and immigrants did not take significantly longer to conceive than other females. We conclude that transfers may not delay reproduction of parous females, but conversely, dispersal may become more likely when successful reproduction is delayed for any reason (e.g., infertility, miscarriages, and infant mortality). We present a preliminary mathematical model to predict how much of a delay a transferring female could afford, if offspring mortality were reduced in her new group."
Female dispersal patterns in six groups of ursine colobus (Colobus vellerosus): infanticide avoidance is important,"['Teichroeb, JA', 'Wikberg, EC', 'Sicotte, P']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/156853909X426363,2009,20,"Under the dispersal/foraging efficiency model, colobines are predicted to be 'indifferent mothers', neither facilitating philopatry for their daughters nor evicting them from the natal home range because food competition is thought to be slight. We observed six groups of Colobus vellerosus at the Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary in Ghana (2000-2007) and recorded changes in female composition caused by observed (N = 11) and inferred (N = 12) emigrations and immigrations (N = 3). We also observed 14 immigration attempts. Most emigrating females were subadult and nulliparous. Parallel emigration was frequent. Resident females behaved aggressively to immigrating females and immigration attempts were rarely successful. Voluntary female emigration (N = 10) occurred mostly when male group membership was unstable or in association with the immigration of all-male bands. Involuntary emigrations (N = 13) associated with increased female-female aggression occurred in the two largest groups, where parous females targeted nulliparous maturing females. Larger groups tended to lose females and female immigration was successful only in the study group with the lowest number of females. Females appear to emigrate to reduce infanticide threat although feeding competition is reduced in smaller groups as well. C. vellerosus at BFMS are better described as 'incomplete suppressors'."

Subjects included 27 males eight to 30 years of age living in three groups in Parc National des Volcans ( Rwanda) between June 2003 and January 2007. Rank was a significant predictor of copulations with both multiparous and nulliparous females, although copulations were more evenly distributed between the three top ranking males than previously reported. Copulations by non-alpha males were unaffected by the level of monopolization potential in the group and relatedness to the alpha silverback. Dispersing males copulated with cycling females prior to their dispersal significantly less than philopatric individuals. As compared to previous studies, we found decreased behavioural reproductive monopolization by the alpha silverback. Additionally, whereas previous studies suggested that patterns of reproductive skew may be best explained by limited control models, our results suggest that concession models should be reconsidered. However, paternity data are needed to determine the relationship between the observed behavioural patterns and changes in reproductive success."

From September 2004 to August 2005 we conducted a study that quantified the temporal and spatial biomass availability of 20 species of herbs frequently consumed by endangered mountain gorillas at two locations (Buhoma and Ruhija) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. In general, the biomass of herbs varied over the study period, but these changes were relatively small. For 12 of 18 and nine of 11 species in Buhoma and Ruhija, respectively, herb biomass differed significantly among habitat types. Of the nine species found in both locations, seven species had a higher biomass at Ruhija, one species had a higher biomass at Buhoma, and one species showed no difference. These results demonstrate that herb biomass varied little temporally but spatial differences in herb biomass were more pronounced. Future studies should investigate the variables that may influence herb phenological patterns such as rainfall, light, soil quality, previous disturbance regimes, and animal foraging and trampling damage."

These small NF90-associated RNAs (snaRs) are transcribed by RNA polymerase III and display restricted tissue distribution, with high expression in testis and discrete areas of the brain. The most abundant human transcript, snaR-A, interacts with the cell's transcription and translation systems. snaR genes have evolved in African Great Apes (human, chimpanzee, and gorilla) and some are unique to humans. We traced their ancestry to the Alu SINE (short interspersed nucleotide element) family, via two hitherto unreported sets of short genetic elements termed ASR (Alu/snaR-related) and CAS (Catarrhine ancestor of snaR). This derivation entails a series of internal deletions followed by expansions. The evolution of these genes coincides with major primate speciation events: ASR elements are found in all monkeys and apes, whereas CAS elements are limited to Old World monkeys and apes. In contrast to ASR and CAS elements, which are retrotransposons, human snaR genes are predominantly located in three clusters on chromosome 19 and have been duplicated as part of a larger genetic element. Insertion of the element containing snaR-G into a gene encoding a chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit generated new hormone genes in African Great Apes."

The only exception is the pericentromeric area of human chromosome 9, which, in addition to a large block of human DNA, also contains a region of homology with gorilla DNA sequences; the localization of these sequences coincides with that of human satellite III. Since highly repetitive DNAs are known for their high mutation frequency, we hypothesized that the chromosome 9 pericentromeric DNA conserved in human chromosomes and deriving from the gorilla genome may thus play some important functional role.

A Non-Human Primate BAC Resource to Study Interchromosomal Segmental Duplications,"['Kirsch, S', 'Hodler, C', 'Schempp, W']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000235930,2009,1,"Segmental duplications (SDs) are involved in the reshaping and evolutionary development of primate genome architecture. Their intrinsic property to promote genomic instability facilitates genome rearrangements, thereby contributing to karyotype diversity in primates. However, comparative analyses of SDs based on whole-genome shotgun assemblies of primate genomes may lead to a distorted view of their evolutionary dynamics as this method will incorrectly assemble or simply not represent these regions. Therefore high-quality sequences of chromosomally assigned SDs are indispensable for unraveling the amplification and dispersal pattern of SDs during primate evolution. Here, we use an updated version of the ancestral duplicon state of the non-palindromic SDs of all 4 human Y-chromosome euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions to perform a survey of duplicons genome-wide across 7 primate species. By adjusting experimental conditions to the mean nucleotide sequence divergence to human we identified 11,075 BAC clones carrying primate orthologs or paralogs of human Y chromosome-derived duplicons. Preliminary results indicate lineage-specific amplification of duplicons in prosimians and gibbons. This BAC-based framework represents the first complete set of a defined number of duplicons over 60 million years of primate evolution. Comparative sequence analysis of this genetic resource can contribute to our deeper understanding of the impact of segmental duplications on primate genome evolution. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

"God, Humans, and Chimps’ Fantastic Allegory in   Bernard Malamud’s God’s Grace","['Song, Tae-Jeong']",English21,NA,2009,0,"This paper is an attempt to discuss Bernard Malamud's last fiction God's Grace (1982), focusing on how he depicts this work using a sophisticated and smooth writing style. Malamud presents the reader with allegorical narratives which seamlessly blend themes like atonement and redemption, grace and mercy, freedom and language, the genre of fantasy and the mode of allegory, and explores comedy and tragedy in the human condition. In the outcome Malamud establishes a fantastic society in which God, humans, and animals coexist.  The most obvious literary precursors of God's Grace are Robinson Crusoe, Lord of the Flies, and Animal Farm. Malamud creates a post-apocalyptic comic fantasy; a pseudo-biblical fable after the manner of the book of Genesis. God's Grace is divided into six parts: “The Flood,” “Cohn's Island,” “The Schooltree,” “The Virgin in the Trees,” “The Voice of the Prophet,” and “God's Mercy,” which may represent the first six days of Creation. Two of the book's motifs are the story of Abraham's sacrifice of his son Isaac at God's request and the Darwinian of evolution. Malamud uses these motifs to begin to approach the human experience. God's Grace is a modern-day dystopian fantasy, set after a thermonuclear war prompts a second flooda radical departure from Malamud's previous fiction. The novel's protagonist is paleontologist Calvin Cohn, who had been attending to his work at the bottom of the ocean when the Devastation struck, and who alone survived. This rabbi's son, now a ‘marginal error' in God's calculation, finds himself shipwrecked with an experimental chimpanzee capable of speech, to whom he gives the name Buz. Other creatures appear on their islandbaboons, chimps, five apes, and a lone gorilla. Cohn works hard to make it possible for God to love His creation again, and his hopes increase as he encounters the unknown and the unforeseen in this strange new world. Having studied for the rabbinate Cohn teaches his Judaic world-view to the primates but faces opposition from Buz whose previous human companion taught him the principles of Christianity. Cohn tries to recreate the monkeys in his own image, and goes as far as formulating his own set of seven commandments and creating his own addition to the scheme of evolution. But alas, paradise is lost again.  Nevertheless, Malamud's God's Grace shows there still may be hope to save our civilization when we confront the wintry devastation of a global doomsday. This book is ultimately a tragedy with a message, when, with our free will, we choose to deny God's mercy."
Muscle-specific integrins in masseter muscle fibers of chimpanzees: an immunohistochemical study,"['Favaloro, A', 'Speranza, G', 'Rezza, S', 'Gatta, V', 'Vaccarino, G', 'Stuppia, L', 'Festa, F', 'Anastasi, G']",FOLIA HISTOCHEMICA ET CYTOBIOLOGICA,10.2478/v10042-009-0095-3,2009,1,"Most notably, recent comparative genomic analyses strongly indicate that the marked differences between modern human and chimpanzees are likely due more to changes in gene regulation than to modifications of the genes. The most peculiar aspect of hominoid karyotypes is that human have 46 chromosomes whereas gorillas and chimpanzees have 48. Interestingly, human and chimpanzees do share identical inversions on chromosome 7 and 9 that are not evident in the gorilla karyotype. Thus, the general phylogeny suggests that humans and chimpanzees are sister taxa; based on this, it seems that human-chimpanzee sequence similarity is an astonishing 99%. At this purpose, of particular interest is the inactivation of the myosin heavy chain 16 (MYH16) gene, most prominently expressed in the masticatory muscle of mammals. It has been showed that the loss of this gene in humans may have resulted in smaller masticatory muscle and consequential changes to cranio-facial morphology and expansion of the human brain case. Powerful masticatory muscles are found in most primates; contrarily, in both modern and fossil member Homo, these muscles are considerably smaller. The evolving hominid masticatory apparatus shifted towards a pattern of gracilization nearly simultaneously with accelerated encephalization in early Homo. To better comprehend the real role of the MYH16 gene, we studied the primary proteins present in the muscle fibers of humans and non-humans, in order to understand if they really can be influenced by MYH16 gene. At this aim we examined the muscle-specific integrins, alpha 7B and beta 1D-integrins, and their relative fetal isoforms, alpha 7A and beta 1A-integrins, analyzing, by immunohistochemistry, muscle biopsies of two components of a chimpanzee's group in captivity, an alpha male and a non-alpha male subjects; all these integrins participate in vital biological processes such as maintenance of tissue integrity, embryonic development, cell differentiation, and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Our results demonstrated a different quantitative composition of integrins, in alpha male in respect to human and non-alpha male, hypothesizing that the MYH16 gene could modify the expression of integrins, influencing, in turn, the phenotype of muscle. In this way, alpha 7A-and beta 1A-integrin could determine the presence of type II fibers and then they could play a key role in the determination of contraction force. Then, MYH16 gene could be a common interactor of signalling between sarcoglycans and integrins in chimpanzee muscles."
A Large Panel of Microsatellite Markers for Genetic Studies in the Infra-Order Catarrhini,"['Roeder, AD', 'Bonhomme, M', 'Heijmans, C', 'Bruford, MW', 'Crouau-Roy, B', 'Doxiadis, G', 'Otting, N']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000211121,2009,6,"Many genetic studies on catarrhines use microsatellite markers that were isolated from human DNA. A large number of these markers have been characterized in the great apes, macaques and baboons. However, there are few or no markers available for other members of this group. In this study, an extensive literature search was performed to find microsatellite markers that had been successfully amplified across a range of catarrhine species. These conserved loci can provide a valuable starting point for characterizing loci in other catarrhines.

A Novel Food Processing Technique by a Wild Mountain Gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei),"['Sawyer, SC', 'Robbins, MM']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000217680,2009,3,"Innovation, the invention of new behavior, has been observed in wild primates only infrequently. The processing of thistle (Cardus nyassanus) has previously been described as being one of the most complex food processing techniques used by mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei). We report a case of innovation in thistle leaf processing by a subadult female mountain gorilla in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. This technique involved rolling the thistle leaves into a ball between her palms prior to putting them in her mouth, as opposed to the standard method of folding leaves. All other weaned individuals (n = 13) were observed to use the standard method to process thistle leaves as described in Byrne et al. While the subadult female emigrated out of the research group 6 months after she had first been observed using the innovative technique, preventing observations of possible transmission within the group, it adds to the debate of whether food processing techniques used by gorillas are socially learned or not.

Our study focused on CT intake in two groups of Lemur catta residing in spiny forest habitat during two reproductive periods. We examined whether L. catta in this habitat avoided plant foods high in CT, and whether reproductive females ingested lower concentrations of CT compared with males, since CT consumption compromises protein absorption. Feeding data and plant food samples were collected during reproductive periods in 2006 (early/mid-lactation) and 2007 (early gestation). Food samples were assayed for CT content, and average CT intake was determined for all focal animals. No significant difference was found in CT content of the most commonly consumed foods compared with other foods in each season or between seasons. No sex differences occurred in CT consumption in either reproductive period. These L. catta did not avoid plant foods high in CT, and three strategies-ingesting small amounts of CT regularly, high amounts only over short periods, and geophagy-may assist these lemurs in coping with CT content in their highly seasonal diet. L. catta may also be somewhat physiologically adapted to cope with CT concentrations in their plant foods. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel"
The Kinematics of Load Carrying in Humans and Great Apes: Implications for the Evolution of Human Bipedalism,"['Watson, J', 'Payne, R', 'Chamberlain, A', 'Jones, R', 'Sellers, WI']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000258646,2009,7,"We present a comparison of loaded and unloaded carrying kinematics in humans, common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus), western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and Bornean and Sumatran orang-utans (Pongo pygmaeus and Pongo abelii). Human hindlimb joint and segment angles were collected during treadmill locomotion using infrared motion analysis cameras. Non-human primate fore-and hindlimb joint and segment angles were collected at zoos during free-ranging locomotion using a standard video camera. In quadrupedal locomotion there were small but potentially important changes associated with load carriage leading to a more upright trunk and a shift in shoulder excursion. These changes were exacerbated as locomotion shifts from quadrupedal to tripedal and bipedal gaits when carrying more awkward loads suggesting a possible adaptive sequence. However, food carrying may favour a highly flexed bent-hip bent-knee bipedal gait since it allows simultaneous foraging and hoarding. In bipedal humans no changes in limb kinematics were seen associated with type of load, although asymmetric loads may lead to lateral postural shifts. Carrying may therefore be an important component of the evolutionary shift to habitual bipedalism, although further work is needed to understand the full biomechanical implications.

Root growth during molar eruption in extant great apes.,"['Kelley, Jay', 'Dean, Christopher', 'Ross, Sasha']",Frontiers of oral biology,10.1159/000242404,2009 (Epub 2009 Sep 21),9,"While there is gradually accumulating knowledge about molar crown formation and the timing of molar eruption in extant great apes, very little is known about root formation during the eruption process. We measured mandibular first and second molar root lengths in extant great ape osteological specimens that died while either the first or second molars were in the process of erupting. For most specimens, teeth were removed so that root lengths could be measured directly. When this was not possible, roots were measured radiographically. We were particularly interested in the variation in the lengths of first molar roots near the point of gingival emergence, so specimens were divided into early, middle and late phases of eruption based on the number of cusps that showed protein staining, with one or two cusps stained equated with immediate post-gingival emergence. For first molars at this stage, Gorilla has the longest roots, followed by Pongo and Pan. Variation in first molar mesial root lengths at this stage in Gorilla and Pan, which comprise the largest samples, is relatively low and represents no more than a few months of growth in both taxa. Knowledge of root length at first molar emergence permits an assessment of the contribution of root growth toward differences between great apes and humans in the age at first molar emergence. Root growth makes up a greater percentage of the time between birth and first molar emergence in humans than it does in any of the great apes. Copyright (c) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel."
Comparative sequence analysis of primate subtelomeres originating from a chromosome fission event,"['Rudd, MK', 'Endicott, RM', 'Friedman, C', 'Walker, M', 'Young, JM', 'Osoegawa, K', 'de Jong, PJ', 'Green, ED', 'Trask, BJ']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.083170.108,JAN 2009,11,"Subtelomeres are concentrations of interchromosomal segmental duplications capped by telomeric repeats at the ends of chromosomes. The nature of the segments shared by different sets of human subtelomeres reflects their high rate of recent interchromosomal exchange. Here, we characterize the rearrangements incurred by the 15q subtelomere after it arose from a chromosome fission event in the common ancestor of great apes. We used FISH, sequencing of genomic clones, and PCR to map the breakpoint of this fission and track the fate of flanking sequence in human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and macaque genomes. The ancestral locus, a cluster of olfactory receptor (OR) genes, lies internally on macaque chromosome 7. Sequence originating from this fission site is split between the terminus of 15q and the pericentromere of 14q in the great apes. Numerous structural rearrangements, including interstitial deletions and transfers of material to or from other subtelomeres, occurred subsequent to the fission, such that each species has a unique 15q structure and unique collection of ORs derived from the fission locus. The most striking rearrangement involved transfer of at least 200 kb from the fission-site region to the end of chromosome 4q, where much still resides in chimpanzee and gorilla, but not in human. This gross structural difference places the subtelomeric defect underlying facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy ( FSHD) much closer to the telomere in human 4q than in the hybrid 4q-15q subtelomere of chimpanzee."

Both have assumed that this bipedalism was almost exclusively on land, in trees or a combination of the two. Recent findings favoured the FU hypothesis by showing that the BK gait is 50-60% more energetically costly than a FU human gait on land. We confirm these findings but show that in water this cost differential is markedly reduced, especially in deeper water, at slower speeds and with greater knee flexion. These data suggest that the controversy about australopithecine locomotion may be eased if it is assumed that wading was a component of their locomotor repertoire and supports the idea that shallow water might have been an environment favourable to the evolution of early forms of ""non-optimal"" hominid bipedalism.

The human MHC genomic region (called HLA) is extremely polymorphic comprising several thousand alleles, each encoding a distinct MHC molecule. The potentially unique specificity of the majority of HLA alleles that have been identified to date remains uncharacterized. Likewise, only a limited number of chimpanzee and rhesus macaque MHC class I molecules have been characterized experimentally. Here, we present NetMHCpan-2.0, a method that generates quantitative predictions of the affinity of any peptide-MHC class I interaction. NetMHCpan-2.0 has been trained on the hitherto largest set of quantitative MHC binding data available, covering HLA-A and HLA-B, as well as chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, gorilla, and mouse MHC class I molecules. We show that the NetMHCpan-2.0 method can accurately predict binding to uncharacterized HLA molecules, including HLA-C and HLA-G. Moreover, NetMHCpan-2.0 is demonstrated to accurately predict peptide binding to chimpanzee and macaque MHC class I molecules. The power of NetMHCpan-2.0 to guide immunologists in interpreting cellular immune responses in large out-bred populations is demonstrated. Further, we used NetMHCpan-2.0 to predict potential binding peptides for the pig MHC class I molecule SLA-1*0401. Ninety-three percent of the predicted peptides were demonstrated to bind stronger than 500 nM. The high performance of NetMHCpan-2.0 for non-human primates documents the method's ability to provide broad allelic coverage also beyond human MHC molecules.

Sequential list-learning by an adolescent lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) using an infrared touchframe apparatus,"['Ross, SR']",INTERACTION STUDIES,10.1075/is.10.2.02ros,2009,3,"The ability to appropriately sequence a list of discrete items is an important facet in performing routine cognitive tasks and may play a significant role in the acquisition of early communication skills. Though the serial learning abilities of some species, such as chimpanzees and rhesus macaques are well documented, there is virtually no information on the extent of these skills with gorillas. In this study, a young female western lowland gorilla has demonstrated the ability to learn a list of seven Arabic numerals by selecting them on a monitor behind an infrared touchframe. As list length increased (from three to seven), Rollie required fewer trials to reach the criterion, suggesting an acquisition of skills associated with serial learning. Rollie was most likely to correctly select the first item in the sequence and least likely to select the penultimate item in the sequence. Her performance suggests serial learning abilities in the range of other non-verbal species and provides preliminary evidence that supports the assertion that gorillas can succeed at this form of serial learning task."

We used fecal examinations to screen the gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in European (Czech Republic, UK) and Australian Zoos to explore the ape-to-ape transmission pattern of T. abrassarti. Gorillas from two out of three European Zoos were positive for T. abrassarti, while gorillas from the Australian Zoo were negative. We documented a horizontal transmission of T. abrassarti to a non-infected adult gorilla introduced into a Troglodytella-positive group in the Prague Zoo and traced the origin of the ciliate infection to the Paignton Zoo (UK) using serial fecal examinations. During this study, two infant gorillas born in the Prague Zoo (CZ) first became positive for T. abrassarti at the age of 9 mo. Ciliate morphology and the sequencing of the small subunit rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer rDNA spacer region revealed that T. abrassarti affects both captive gorillas and chimpanzees. We conclude that zoo transport plays a major role in the distribution of T. abrassarti among captive gorillas."

Morphological Comparison in Structures between Human Hair and Mammalian Hair,['류은주'],Journal of the Korean Society of Design Culture,NA,2009,0,"In light of that hair is carried out the morphological structure and the correlative role side by side possessed by peculiar waterproof and radiation, as well as by shape according to keeping warm, protection, and symbolic function, it is related to cooling and insulation that correspond to shape in hair. As for mammalian hair, the hair follicle within the body according to genetic or environmental follicle conversion develops or degenerates as the hair in every type, thereby allowing length or thickness to be different depending on region in the body. As this phenomenon is regulated by dermal papilla, the cycle in growth is possessed by hair itself. So, the essence that hair has is composed of medulla in the central part, cortex and cuticle in its outward side for the structure in hair. The kinds that are possessed by human hair and primate hair are divided into lanugo hair, terminal hair, vellus hair, and intermediate hair. However, lanugo hair and vellus hair here are not discriminated morphologically, thereby having been treated as the same classification. Also, as the morphological definition is varied depending on kind in hair, location in generation of hair, and severally other causes, this study aimed to examine human hair and large-ape mammalian hair with comparison according to morphological observation. It aims to identify what kind of characteristics the minute structure of hair fiber has as a hair nature in the formative structure. The samples, which were used in experiment, were collected hair over 4 times from January to September in 2008, by dividing into summer and winter in pigment hair and gray hair for each in men and women of two types in their 50s, and orangoutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee, which are being bred in the zoo.  Each sample was sectionally treated in 30 seconds after charging nitrogen liquid, and was sampled by adhering it to stage with carbon tape, thereby having been coated for 80 seconds with thickness in 20mm with gold or plutonium by using Ion-sputter(JFC-1100, Japan) after performing the vacuum processing(Hotachi Scp-11, Japan) for 25 minutes. So, it was observed in the accelerating voltage of 15kv with Scanning election microscope(SEM, S4200, Japan, KBSI, Busan). As a result of observation, the human hair was observed approximately 2～7 sectionally cuticullar cells in the shape of hair. Even in the cuticle cell, it was observed highly enough to be 310 pieces in the breast hair of people in their 50s, who are being progressed the male pattern hair loss, and in the summer hair of gorilla. As for the thickness in hair, the human hair is 4585㎛, thus the Primate was indicated to be higher by about ±30 with 75120㎛. However, even in hair, the number in cuticle cell was not certainly proportional for a reason that size in hair is thick. Whether or not medulla was not proportional, too. In other words, medulla existed in the vellus hair, which is human hair in about 45㎛. However, medulla didn't exist in the normal hair of men in their 50s with thickness in 75㎛ or in summer hair of gorilla. As the Primate hair can be observed to be definitely divided into summer hair and winter hair compared to human hair, the medulla was not shown in summer hair of orangoutan and gorilla compared to winter hair. Accordingly, as for structure in hair, the growth according to shape is changed differently depending on season in animal, but couldn't be observed in a person. Human hair showed the nutritional and genetic correlation with difference in growth of hair cycle that is possessed by the ratio in Anagen or silent period, rather than seasonally environmental physiology in summer and winter.  Even in the category of natural hair color that is possessed by yes or no of melanin in light of SEM, the difference in gray hair and pigment hair is just indicated by concentration or size in pigment granule. Still, it was observed to be not that there is no pigment granule at all. Even clubbed hair, which is possessed by bulb of hair, has difference by more than twice when having size, respectively, in 75215㎛ for human hair and 130750㎛ for Primate hair. It suggested the possibility of indirectly describing that the Anagen cycle is longer in Primate, in proportion of size that hair has, thereby having presented the organic element that beauty has including theoretical consideration."
Two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction improves the speed and accuracy of genotyping using DNA from noninvasive and museum samples,"['Arandjelovic, M', 'Guschanski, K', 'Schubert, G', 'Harris, TR', 'Thalmann, O', 'Siedel, H', 'Vigilant, L']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,10.1111/j.1755-0998.2008.02387.x,JAN 2009,68,"Many studies in molecular ecology rely upon the genotyping of large numbers of low-quantity DNA extracts derived from noninvasive or museum specimens. To overcome low amplification success rates and avoid genotyping errors such as allelic dropout and false alleles, multiple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) replicates for each sample are typically used. Recently, two-step multiplex procedures have been introduced which drastically increase the success rate and efficiency of genotyping. However, controversy still exists concerning the amount of replication needed for suitable control of error. Here we describe the use of a two-step multiplex PCR procedure that allows rapid genotyping using at least 19 different microsatellite loci. We applied this approach to quantified amounts of noninvasive DNAs from western chimpanzee, western gorilla, mountain gorilla and black and white colobus faecal samples, as well as to DNA from 100-year-old gorilla teeth from museums. Analysis of over 45 000 PCRs revealed average success rates of > 90% using faecal DNAs and 74% using museum specimen DNAs. Average allelic dropout rates were substantially reduced compared to those obtained using conventional singleplex PCR protocols, and reliable genotyping using low (< 25 pg) amounts of template DNA was possible. However, four to five replicates of apparently homozygous results are needed to avoid allelic dropout when using the lowest concentration DNAs (< 50 pg/reaction), suggesting that use of protocols allowing routine acceptance of homozygous genotypes after as few as three replicates may lead to unanticipated errors when applied to low-concentration DNAs."
Chimpanzee faces are 'special' to humans,"['Taubert, J']",PERCEPTION,10.1068/p6254,2009,17,"A longstanding proposal is that primates, including humans, might have an innate representation of face structure. But, if humans have such a representation, how broad is its form: limited to coding conspecifies, or general enough to cover related species? The results reported here show adult humans process faces of chimpanzees in a way previously assumed to be exclusive to human faces. The composite effect was used to provide the first direct test of so-called holistic processing. Despite no lifetime experience of chimpanzees, adult humans showed a substantial composite effect for chimpanzee faces, and also an inversion effect. There was no similar evidence of holistic processing for faces of species of greater phylogenic distance from humans, including gorillas, spider monkeys, sheep, chickens, and Jazzy lizards; nor was there any effect for non-face objects. In contrast to the holistic processing results, discrimination of chimpanzee faces was, as expected, poor. In the context of evidence that poor discrimination of heterospecific faces arises from a process of perceptual narrowing in infancy, our results suggest that adults retain some aspects of a broader bandwidth present in neonates (holistic processing) but lose others (discrimination)."
Effects of Hardness of Primordial Binaries on the Evolution of Star Clusters,"['Tanikawa, A', 'Fukushige, T']",PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN,NA,2009,11,"We have investigated the effects of the hardness of primordial binaries on the whole evolution of star clusters by means of N-body simulations. Using a newly developed code, GORILLA, we simulated eleven N = 16384 clusters with primordial binaries whose binding energies are equal in each cluster in the range of 1-300 kT(0), where 1.5 kT(0) is the average stellar kinetic energy at the initial time. We found that, in both the soft (<= 3 kT(0)) and hard (>= 300 kT(0)) limits, clusters experience deep core collapse. For intermediate hardness (10-100 kT(0)), the core collapses halt halfway due to an energy releases of the primordial binaries. The core radii at the halt can be explained by their energy budget."
Rates of self-directed behaviour and faecal glucocorticoid levels are not correlated in female wild olive baboons (Papio hamadryas anubis),"['Higham, JP', 'MacLarnon, AM', 'Heistermann, M', 'Ross, C', 'Semple, S']",STRESS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON THE BIOLOGY OF STRESS,10.3109/10253890902756565,2009,22,"Non-invasive methods to quantify components of stress in non-human animals rely typically on the use of physiological or behavioural measures. At the physiological level, stress is usually measured non-invasively in terms of faecal or urinary glucocorticoid output. A common group of behavioural measures used are self-directed behaviours (SDBs), which have been shown to be linked to anxiety, a subset of stress, although a number of authors have explicitly linked SDBs to stress more generally. Whether increased rates of SDBs are likely to be associated with increased faecal glucocorticoid ouput in wild mammals remains unclear. Here, for wild female olive baboons, we show no association between day-to-day changes in levels of SDB and cortisol metabolite excretion. We also show no relationship between long-term mean levels of these variables. We discuss several possible interpretations of our results, including the possibility that SDBs represent a behavioural coping mechanism, helping to ameliorate the physiological stress response."

We provide guidelines for implementing such a program and make recommendations that will help institutions to employ behavioral monitoring programs with reasonable expense.

Visitor effects on anxiety in two captive groups of western lowland gorillas,"['Carder, G', 'Semple, S']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2008.06.001,DEC 31 2008,16,"There is growing interest in examining the effects that visitors have on the welfare of zoo primates. Most recently. the importance of evaluating the combined impacts of visitors and management practices on anxiety levels of these animals has been highlighted. Studies that take such an approach have the potential not only to highlight how visitors affect the welfare of zoo primates, but also how these impacts may be mediated by management interventions, such as enrichment. The aim of this study was to explore the potential impact of visitor numbers on behavioural indices of anxiety among western lowland gorillas in two UK zoos. Port Lympne and Chessington, and to determine whether feeding enrichment mediates any such visitor effects. During fifteen minute focal watches, visitor numbers were assessed and all occurrence data collected on two behavioural indices of anxiety: self-scratching and visual monitoring of visitors. Data collected at each site were divided according to whether they were taken during periods of feeding enrichment, or during periods when no such enrichment was being given. Analyses revealed no evidence for a visitor effect at Chessington, with durations of self-scratching and visual monitoring unrelated to visitor number, either during periods of enrichment or outside of such times. At Port Lympne, durations of both self-scratching and visual monitoring were positively associated with visitor number when no feeding enrichment was taking placed no such relationships were seen, however, during periods of feeding enrichment. Potential reasons for the difference between sites in the occurrence of visitor effects, and for the absence of visitor effects during feeding enrichment at Port Lympne are discussed. The results of this study highlight the importance of assessing visitor effects on the same species at multiple sites, and also suggest that such effects may be reduced by positive management approaches.

The ranging behaviour of golden monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis kandti) in Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, Uganda was studied from January 2003 to February 2004 to establish habitat preferences. In each 0.25 ha grid cell in the group's home range we quantified the basal area of food trees (n = 12,133 trees), measured bamboo (Arundinaria alpina) stems (n = 103,548), and estimated vine and shrub coverage. The evaluation of habitat preferences was facilitated by the fact that only five plant species, plus invertebrates (7.5%) constituted 96.4% of the group's foraging effort; this included bamboo (59.9%), Maesa lanceolata (18.7%), Hypericum revolutum (6.8%), Galiniera saxifraga (2.1%) and Ilex mitis (1.4%). Phenology data were collected for all five food tree species, three vines, and two shrubs. Range use generally followed food tree basal area distribution and not the distribution of bamboo, with the abundance of M. lanceolata being more closely associated with home range use than any other food plant. Bamboo was ubiquitous in distribution and a vital year-round resource for golden monkeys, which they combined with other food items to meet their nutritional requirements. Illegal bamboo or tree extraction both pose a serious threat to the conservation of the golden monkey, but activities that affect food tree abundance will likely have the most influence on monkey persistence."
Measuring Physical Traits of Primates Remotely: The Use of Parallel Lasers,"['Rothman, JM', 'Chapman, CA', 'Twinomugisha, D', 'Wasserman, MD', 'Lambert, JE', 'Goldberg, TL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20611,DEC 2008,15,"Physical traits, such as body size, and processes like growth can be used as indices of primate health and can add to our understanding of life history and behavior. Accurately measuring physical traits in the wild can be challenging because capture is difficult, disrupts animals, and may cause injury. To measure physical traits of arboreal primates remotely, we adapted a parallel laser technique that has been used with terrestrial and marine mammals. Two parallel lasers separated by a known distance (4 cm) and mounted onto a digital camera are projected onto an animal. When a photograph is taken, the laser projections on the target provide a scale bar. We validated the technique for measuring the physical traits of identifiable red colobus monkeys (Procolobus rufomitratus) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. First, we photographed the tails of monkeys with laser projections and compared these with measurements previously obtained when the animals were captured. Second, we manually measured the distance between two markers placed on tree branches at similar heights to those used by monkeys, and compared them with the measurements obtained through digital photographs of the markers with parallel laser projections. The mean tail length of the monkeys via manual measurements was 63.3 +/- 4.4 cm, and via remote measurements was 63.0 +/- 4.1 cm. The mean distance between the markers on tree branches via manual measurements was 13.8 +/- 3.59cm, and via remote measurements was 13.9 +/- 3.58 cm. The mean error using parallel lasers was 1.7% in both cases. Although the needed precision will depend on the question asked, our results suggest that sufficiently precise measurements of physical traits or substrates of arboreal primates can be obtained remotely using parallel lasers.

We collected Escherichia coli bacteria from humans, livestock, and mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, from May to August 2005 to examine whether habitat overlap influences rates and patterns of pathogen transmission between humans and apes and whether livestock might facilitate transmission. We genotyped 496 E. coli isolates with repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting and measured susceptibility to 11 antibiotics with the disc-diffusion method. We conducted population genetic analyses to examine genetic differences among populations of bacteria from different hosts and locations. Gorilla populations that overlapped in their use of habitat at high rates with people and livestock harbored E. coli that were genetically similar to E. coli from those people and livestock, whereas E. coli from gorillas that did not overlap in their use of habitats with people and livestock were more distantly related to human or livestock bacteria. Thirty-five percent of isolates from humans, 27% of isolates from livestock, and 17% of isolates from gorillas were clinically resistant to at least one antibiotic used by local people, and the proportion of individual gorillas harboring resistant isolates declined across populations in proportion to decreasing degrees of habitat overlap with humans. These patterns of genetic similarity and antibiotic resistance among E. coli from populations of apes, humans, and livestock indicate that habitat overlap between species affects the dynamics of gastrointestinal bacterial transmission, perhaps through domestic animal intermediates and the physical environment. Limiting such transmission would benefit human and domestic animal health and ape conservation."

The model uses body mass and climatic data to predict the time animals must allocate to key activities (feeding, moving, resting and social interaction), and then uses these to assess the limiting group size that could be sustained in a particular habitat. The model is robust against changes in minimum cut-off values, and predicts the current biogeographic distributions of the two African ape species remarkably well. Predicted group sizes for Parr and Gorilla are close to observed averages. The model also indicates that moving time plays a crucial role for both Pan and Gorilla site presence: i.e. at sites where they are absent it is primarily moving time that is increased as compared to other time budget variables. Finally, the model demonstrates that Pan and Gorilla distributions and group sizes can be accurately modelled by simply modifying the body mass variable, indicating that both share a similar underlying ecological bauplan."
Social Relationships Among Male Alouatta pigra,"['Van Belle, S', 'Estrada, A', 'Strier, K']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-008-9309-y,DEC 2008,21,"We investigated male social relationships in 2 groups of black howlers (Alouatta pigra) in Palenque National Park, Mexico, over a 14-mo study characterized by frequent changes in male group membership. Both single males and pairs of males entered our focal groups. Single males tended to join groups, whereas pairs of males entering groups together successfully evicted resident males. The 19 male dyads across the 11 periods defined by changes in group membership were rarely in close proximity or interacting with one another. Nevertheless, 1 male formed significantly closer associations with resident females in 6 periods and achieved higher mating success during 4 of the periods when a parts per thousand yen1 female was sexually active. In the other 5 periods, no particular male maintained significantly closer associations with resident females, which may be a result of the rapid sequence of changes in male membership and corresponding social instability. Resident males participated frequently and consistently in mutual howling, but the resident male with the strongest female associations and highest mating success initiated howling bouts more frequently in all but 1 of the 6 socially stable periods. Though still preliminary, our findings suggest that variation in social relationships among male black howlers may be more related to their ability to establish strong relationships with females than to their relationships with one another."
Hominid mandibular corpus shape variation and its utility for recognizing species diversity within fossil Homo,"['Lague, MR', 'Collard, NJ', 'Richmond, BG', 'Wood, BA']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2008.00989.x,DEC 2008,11,"Mandibular corpora are well represented in the hominin fossil record, yet few studies have rigorously assessed the utility of mandibular corpus morphology for species recognition, particularly with respect to the linear dimensions that are most commonly available. In this study, we explored the extent to which commonly preserved mandibular corpus morphology can be used to: (i) discriminate among extant hominid taxa and (ii) support species designations among fossil specimens assigned to the genus Homo. In the first part of the study, discriminant analysis was used to test for significant differences in mandibular corpus shape at different taxonomic levels (genus, species and subspecies) among extant hominid taxa (i.e. Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo). In the second part of the study, we examined shape variation among fossil mandibles assigned to Homo (including H. habilis sensu stricto, H. rudolfensis, early African H. erectus/H. ergaster, late African H. erectus, Asian H. erectus, H. heidelbergensis, H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens). A novel randomization procedure designed for small samples (and using group 'distinctness values') was used to determine whether shape variation among the fossils is consistent with conventional taxonomy (or alternatively, whether a priori taxonomic groupings are completely random with respect to mandibular morphology). The randomization of 'distinctness values' was also used on the extant samples to assess the ability of the test to recognize known taxa. The discriminant analysis results demonstrated that, even for a relatively modest set of traditional mandibular corpus measurements, we can detect significant differences among extant hominids at the genus and species levels, and, in some cases, also at the subspecies level. Although the randomization of 'distinctness values' test is more conservative than discriminant analysis (based on comparisons with extant specimens), we were able to detect at least four distinct groups among the fossil specimens (i.e. H. sapiens, H. heidelbergensis, Asian H. erectus and a combined 'African Homo' group consisting of H. habilis sensu stricto, H. rudolfensis, early African H. erectus/H. ergaster and late African H. erectus). These four groups appear to be distinct at a level similar to, or greater than, that of modern hominid species. In addition, the mandibular corpora of H. neanderthalensis could be distinguished from those of 'African Homo', although not from those of H. sapiens, H. heidelbergensis, or the Asian H. erectus group. The results suggest that the features most commonly preserved on the hominin mandibular corpus have some taxonomic utility, although they are unlikely to be useful in generating a reliable alpha taxonomy for early African members of the genus Homo."

Evolutionary modifications of human milk composition: evidence from long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid composition of anthropoid milks,"['Milligan, LA', 'Bazinet, RP']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.07.010,DEC 2008,21,"Brain growth in mammals is associated with increased accretion of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) in brain phospholipids. The period of maximum accumulation is during the brain growth spurt. Humans have a perinatal brain growth spurt, selectively accumulating docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and other LCPUFA from the third trimester through the second year of life. The emphasis on rapid postnatal brain growth and LCPUFA transfer during lactation has led to the suggestion that human milk LCPUFA composition may be unique. Our study tests this hypothesis by determining fatty acid composition for 11 species of captive anthropoids (n = 53; Callithrix jacchus, Cebus apella, Gorilla gorilla, Hylobates lar, Leontopithecus rosalia, Macaca mulatta, Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Pongo pygmaeus, Saimiri boliviensis, and Symphalangus syndactylus). Results are compared to previously published data on five species of wild anthropoids (n = 28; Alouatta paliatta, Callithrix jacchus, Gorilla beringei, Leontopithecus rosalia, and Macaca sinica) and human milk fatty acid profiles. Milk LCPUFA profiles of captive anthropoids (consuming diets with a preformed source of DHA) are similar to milk from women on a Western diet, and those of wild anthropoids are similar to milk from vegan women. Collectively, the range of DHA percent composition values from nonhuman anthropoid milks (0.03-1.1) is nearly identical to that from a cross-cultural analysis of human milk (0.06-1.4). Humans do not appear to be unique in their ability to secrete LCPUFA in milk but may be unique in their access to dietary LCPUFA. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Faecal analyses revealed Balantidium (B.) coli trophozoites and salmonella-like bacteria. Despite treatment the gorilla died on the 5th day after onset of symptoms. Post-mortem examination revealed a severe erosive-ulcerative superficial and deep colitis. Histological examination of post-mortem samples of the colon showed plentiful B. coli invading into the mucosa and submucosa, whilst PCR screening of bacterial DNA could not confirm any bacteria species which could be connected to the clinical picture. As B. coli is usually a non-pathogenic gut commensal, and as this animal previously showed evidence of non-symptomatic infection of B. coli, it is possible that the switch in pathogenicity was triggered by an acute bacterial infection. Despite successful treatment of the bacterial infection the secondary deep invasion of B. coli was not reversed, possibly because of the failure of the treatment regimen, and led to the death of the gorilla."

Comparison of health parameters between sites revealed statistically significant differences in body weight, body temperature, respiratory rate, hematology parameters (white cell count, hematocrit, segmented neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count), serum chemistry parameters (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, serum alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, chloride, and creatinine phosphokinase), and nutrition parameters (copper, zinc, ferritin, retinol, tocopherol, and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol). Two of 10 lemurs tested were positive for toxoplasmosis; none of 10 were positive for Cryptosporidium or Giardia. Enteric bacteria and endo- and ectoparasites were typical. Statistically different values in hematology and chemistry values probably do not reflect clinically significant differences, whereas nutrition parameter differences are likely related to season, soil, and forage availability."

Landscape characteristics such as rivers, mountains, or habitat fragmentation affect dispersal and result in broad-scale genetic structuring of various mammalian species [1-5]. However, less attention has been paid to studying how dispersal is influenced by finer-scale microgeographic variation in a continuous habitat. Here we investigate the genetic structure of a closed population of similar to 300 endangered mountain gorillas living in multiple groups in a small (331 km(2)) forest in southwestern Uganda. In a species in which both sexes routinely disperse, population genetic structure in females was influenced by distance, altitude, and plant community composition, whereas males were not geographically structured. The effect of distance fits the observed tendency of females to transfer to neighboring groups, whereas the effects of altitude and vegetation reflect the changing species composition of locally available food resources. These results suggest that individual dietary preferences are important even in a highly mobile species living amid abundant food, and we propose that preference for natal habitats will influence dispersal decisions in many other vertebrate taxa."
Hyperprogesteronemia in Response to Vitex fischeri Consumption in Wild Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii),"['Thompson, ME', 'Wilson, ML', 'Gobbo, G', 'Muller, MN', 'Pusey, AE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20600,NOV 2008,5,"Chimpanzees in Gombe National Park consume fruits of Vitex fischeri during a short annual fruiting season. This fruit species is a member of a genus widely studied for phytoestrogen composition and varied physiological effects. One particularly well-studied species, V. agnus-castus, is noted for its documented effects on female reproductive function, evidenced in increased progesterone levels and consequent regulation of luteal function. We examined reproductive hormone levels in both male and female chimpanzees during a 6-week period of intense V fischeri consumption. V. fischeri consumption was associated with an abrupt and dramatic increase in urinary progesterone levels of female chimpanzees to levels far exceeding the normal range of variation. Female estrogen levels were not significantly impacted, nor were male testosterone levels. These are some of the first data indicating that phytochemicals in the natural diet of a primate can have significant impacts on the endocrine system, though the fluctuating nature of chimpanzee diet and reproductive function does not allow us to determine whether the effects observed during this short period had a broader positive or negative impact on female fertility. Given the widespread use of various Vitex species by African primates and the as-yet-undescribed phytochemical properties of these species, we predict that our observations may be indicative of a broader phenomenon.

A conflict of interest exists between female and male residents over the immigration of new females: additional females increase female feeding competition but provide new mating opportunities for males. Resident females express their interests by directing high rates of aggression towards immigrants, and males could protect their interests by intervening in these conflicts. We studied the Kanyawara chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda over 10.5 years to assess whether (1) resident female aggression is costly to immigrants, (2) males are effective in protecting immigrants from aggression and (3) immigrants seek out male protective services. Results showed costs of resident aggression on two levels. Immigrants held low dominance ranks and experienced higher physiological stress than natal residents, as indexed by urinary cortisol. Males were found to be effective protectors for immigrants. They intervened aggressively to curtail female conflicts, more often when conflicts involved immigrants and occurred during periods of heightened female competition. When intervening, males nearly always supported immigrants over residents. As a result, females, especially immigrants, experienced less intrasexual aggression in the presence of males than when males were absent. Immigrants took advantage of male protective services. They associated with males more often than resident females and, unlike residents, did not greatly decrease their level of association outside of oestrus. We suggest male protection is an important strategy used by immigrants to integrate themselves into their new group. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

All animals were exposed, in an ABA design, to two conditions of auditory stimulation: a 'control' (no auditory stimulation), and an 'experimental' condition, during which the animals were presented with a commercially-available CD of classical music. Each condition lasted for five days, with an interim period of two days between each condition (Study 1). The elephants' behaviour was recorded every minute for four hours a day for the full five days of each condition using instantaneous scan-sampling. The procedure was repeated four months later (Study 2), for a shorter period of time (one day per condition, again using an ABA design), to assess whether the results are generalisable. Analysis of both studies revealed that the elephants spent significantly less of their time stereotyping during the experimental conditions than the control. None of the other behaviours recorded were influenced significantly by auditory stimulation. Overall, the findings from this study suggest that auditory stimulation, in the form of classical music, may be a useful method of reducing stereotypic behaviour in zoo-housed Asian elephants, although more long-term work with a larger number of animals is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn."

Materials and Methods: A total of 121 consecutive esophagi (from 103 baboons and 18 macaques) were classified according to Ismail-Beiji for reflux esophagitis in humans into grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3 esophagitis. Results: Histological features compatible with reflux esophagitis were found in 28.2% of the baboons and in 22.2% of the macaques. Esophagitis grade I was more common in baboons (24%) than in macaques (6%), while esophagitis grade 2 was more common in macaques (17%) than in baboons (2%). Conclusion: Although the prevalence of reflux esophagitis in man is at least 2%, only a fraction of patients demonstrate histological features consistent with grades 1, 2 or 3 esophagitis. Hence, the finding that 27% of a cohort of consecutive, unselected NHP had grades 1, 2 or 3 esophagitis at histology is remarkable. The possible causes for the difference between species, such as the oblique position often adopted by NHP during the gastric phase of digestion, the diet, regurgitation and subsequent re-ingestion, as well as the stress of NHP when kept in captivity, are reviewed."
"Early hominid bone tools from Drimolen, South Africa","['Backwell, L', ""d'Errico, F""]",JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE,10.1016/j.jas.2008.05.017,NOV 2008,18,"The earliest use of bone tools is a topic of ongoing debate that concerns the criteria used to identify utilised or minimally modified bone tools, and if verified, the implications for hominid adaptation and cognition. Here we present the first description of 22 possible bone tools from the early hominid site of Drimolen (Gauteng Province, South Africa), dated similar to 1.5-2 Mya. We compare the results of a taphonomic, morphometric and microscopic analysis of these pieces with those obtained from the study of faunal assemblages modified by a variety of non-human agents, and experimentally modified bones. None of the naturally modified assemblages contained pieces hearing the wear pattern observed on specimens from Drimolen and on bones experimentally used in digging activities. Fourteen pieces from Drimolen bear a pattern comparable to one previously described on early hominid bone tools from Sterkfontein and Swartkrans. This suggests that Drimolen bone tools were involved in a similar, if not exactly the same, task. Other common features include favoured bone types, fracture patterns, and the length and position of the worn area. Larger bone tools known from Swartkrans are absent at Drimolen, perhaps due to less availability of large mammal bones. The association of a high number of Paranthropus remains with bone tools at Drimolen, and the exceedingly low number of stone tools at the site supports the hypothesis that Paranthropus robustus used these bone tools. Based on implement-assisted termite foraging strategies amongst chimpanzees, we have inferred similar social and cultural behaviours for early hominids. Gorillas were recently proposed as a model for P. robustus social structure due to the high degree of sexual dimorphism observed. According to female aggregation practices present in both models, one can speculate that if P. robustus was the user of the bone tools, the foraging activity in which they were used may have been conducted mainly by females.

Assessing the Validity of Ape-Human Comparisons: A Reply to Boesch (2007),"['Tomasello, M', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/0735-7036.122.4.449,NOV 2008,13,"Boesch (2007) criticizes research comparing ape and human cognition on the basis of both internal and external validity. The authors show here that most of those criticisms are not valid because: (i) most threats to internal validity (e.g., conspecific experimenters for humans but not apes) are controlled for experimentally; (ii) externally, there is no empirical evidence that captive apes have fewer cognitive skills than wild apes and indeed some evidence (especially from human-raised apes) that they have more; and (iii) externally, there is no empirical evidence that Western middle-class children have different cognitive skills from other children at very early ages in basic cognitive domains. Although difficult, with appropriate methodological care, experimental cross-species comparisons may be validly made."
Evolution of a complex minisatellite DNA sequence,"['Barros, P', 'Blanco, MG', 'Boan, F', 'Gomez-Marquez, J']",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.ympev.2008.07.021,NOV 2008,3,"Minisatellites are tandem repeats of short DNA units widely distributed in genomes. However, the information on their dynamics in a phylogenetic context is very limited. Here we have studied the organization of the MsH43 locus in several species of primates and from these data we have reconstructed the evolutionary history of this complex minisatellite. Overall, with the exception of gibbon, MsH43 has an organization that is asymmetric, since the distribution of repeats is distinct between the 5' and 3' halves, and heterogeneous since there are many different repeats, some of them characteristic of each species. Inspection of the MsH43 arrays showed the existence of many duplications and deletions, suggesting the implication of slippage processes in the generation of polymorphism. Concerning the evolutionary history of this minisatellite, we propose that the birth of MsH43 may be situated before the divergence of Old World Monkeys since we found the existence of some MsH43 repeat motifs in prosimians and New World Monkeys. The analysis of MsH43 in apes revealed the existence of an evolutionary breakpoint in the pathway that originated African great apes and humans. Remarkably, human MsH43 is more homologous to orang-utan than to the corresponding sequence in gorilla and chimpanzee. This finding does not comply with the evolutionary paradigm that continuous alterations occur during the course of genome evolution. To adjust our results to the standard phylogeny of primates, we propose the existence of a wandering allele that was maintained almost unaltered during the period that extends between orang-utan and humans.

Tentative identification of the species of Balantidium from ostriches (Struthio camelus) as Balantidium coli-like by analysis of polymorphic DNA,"['Ponce-Gordo, F', 'Jimenez-Ruiz, E', 'Martinez-Diaz, RA']",VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/j.vetpar.2008.06.024,OCT 20 2008,10,"The characteristics of Balantidium from ostriches (Struthio camelus) are similar to those of Balantidium coli; however, the species Balantidium struthionis was proposed on the basis of the host species (ostriches) and the shape of the macronucleus (with a deep depression in one side). In the present work, we have performed morphological and genetic comparisons between isolated of Balantidium from ostriches and B. coli from pigs to determine the specific status of B. struthionis. The morphological characteristics of the trophozoites of Balantidium from ostriches were reviewed in 100 trophozoites from two isolates. The macronucleus' shape of the ostrich Balantidium was highly variable, thus the use of this criterion for diagnostic purposes is not reliable. Besides, very few trophozoites showed a deep depression in their macronucleus and almost all the trophozoites conform to the description of B. coli. The complete sequence of the DNA coding for the 18s-rRNA-ITS1-5.8s-rRNA-ITS2 regions were obtained by PCR from five pig and five ostrich isolates. The sequences corresponding to the 18s and 5.8s-rRNA genes were identical for the ostrich and pig isolates. Two clearly different genotypes were found in the analysis of the ITS1 and ITS2 regions of the pig isolates; the genotype A was identified in all isolates, while the genotype B was found in only two of them. Their sequences show clear differences from that published corresponding to a B. coli gorilla isolate, which we will consider as a different genotype, C. In our opinion, these different B. coli genotypes reflect the genetic variability of this organism, but further studies would be necessary to determine if it could have practical importance. The polymorphism of the ITS regions have been also found in the ostrich isolates. The same genotypes A and B have been identified, although not as mixed infections. The morphological characteristics and the genetic results suggest that the species name B. struthionis is a synonym of B. coli; however, until experimental infections are carried out to determine if the parasite is transmissible between pigs and ostriches, it would be preferable to tentatively designate it as B. coli-like.

Beyond DNA: RNA editing and steps toward Alu exonization in primates,"['Moller-Krull, M', 'Zemann, A', 'Roos, C', 'Brosius, J', 'Schmitz, J']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jmb.2008.07.014,OCT 10 2008,25,"The exaptation of transposed elements into protein-coding domains by a process called exonization is one important evolutionary pathway for generating novel variant functions of gene products. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) modification is a recently discovered, RNA-editing-mediated mechanism that contributes to the exonization of previously unprocessed mRNA introns. In the human nuclear prelamin A recognition factor gene transcript, the alternatively spliced exon 8 results from an A-to-I editing-generated 3' splice site located within an intronic Alu short interspersed element. Sequence comparisons of representatives of all primate infraorders revealed the critical evolutionary steps leading to this editing-mediated exonization. The source of exon 8 was seeded within the primary transcript about 58-40 million years ago by the head-to-head insertions of two primate-specific Alu short interspersed elements in the common ancestor of anthropoids. The latent protein-coding potential was realized 34-52 million years later in a common ancestor of gorilla, chimpanzee, and human as a result of numerous changes at the RNA and DNA level. Comparisons of 426 processed mRNA clones from various primate species with their genomic sequences identified seven different RNA-editing-mediated alternative splice variants. In total, 30 A-to-I editing sites were identified. The gorilla, chimpanzee, and human nuclear prelamin A recognition factor genes exemplify the versatile interplay of pre-and posttranscriptional modifications leading to novel genetic potential.

Assessing mandibular shape variation within Gigantopithecus using a geometric morphometric approach,"['Miller, SF', 'White, JL', 'Ciochon, RL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20856,OCT 2008,4,"This study provides a survey of mandibular shape in a sample of extant hominoids (Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, and Hylobates), as well as extinct Asian and Eurasian taxa (Ouranopithecus, Sivapithecus, and Gigantopithecus) in order to compare overall shape similarity. Results presented call into question differences in mandible shape recently used to distinguish Gigantopithecus giganteus from Gigantopithecus blacki and to justify resurrecting a different generic designation, ""Indopithecus,"" for the former. It is concluded that while the two large-bodied Asian taxa may have been adapted to slightly different dietary niches with different geographic and temporal ranges, the unique mandibular/dental characters that the two taxa share should not be viewed as independent evolutionary developments."

Food preferences of wild mountain gorillas,"['Ganas, J', 'Ortmann, S', 'Robbins, MM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20584,OCT 2008,14,"Determining the nutritional and phenolic basis of food preference is important for understanding the nutritional requirements of animals. Preference is a measure of which foods would be consumed by an animal if there was no variation in availability among food items. From September 2004 to August 2005, we measured the food preferences of four wild mountain gorilla groups that consume foliage and fruit in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, to determine what nutrients and phenols are preferred and/or avoided. To do so, we asked the following questions: (1) Which plant species do the gorillas prefer? (2) Considering the different plant parts consumed of these preferred species, what nutrients and/or phenols characterize them? (3) Do the nutritional and phenolic characteristics of preferred foods differ among gorilla groups? We found that although some species were preferred and others were not, of those species found in common among the different group home ranges, the same ones were generally preferred by all groups. Second, all groups preferred leaves with relatively high protein content and relatively low fiber content. Third, three out of four groups preferred leaves with relatively high sugar amounts. Fourth, all groups preferred pith with relatively high sugar content. Finally, of the two groups tested, we found that the preferred fruits of one group had relatively high condensed tannin and fiber/sugar contents, whereas the other group's preferred fruits were not characterized by any particular nutrient/phenol. Overall, there were no differences among gorilla groups in nutritional and phenolic preferences. Our results indicate that protein and sugar are important in the diets of gorillas, and that the gorillas fulfil these nutritional requirements through a combination of different plant parts, shedding new light on how gorillas balance their diets in a variable environment."
Hominoid seminal protein evolution and ancestral mating behavior,"['Carnahan, SJ', 'Jensen-Seaman, MI', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20585,OCT 2008,21,"Hominoid mating systems show extensive variation among species. The degree of sexual dimorphism in body size and canine size varies among primates in accordance with their mating system, as does the testes size and the consistency of ejaculated semen, in response to differing levels of sperm competition. To investigate patterns of evolution at hominoid seminal proteins and to make inferences regarding the mating systems of extinct taxa, we sequenced the entire coding region of the prostate-specific transglutaminase (TGM4) gene in human, chimpanzee, bonobo, western lowland gorilla, eastern lowland gorilla, orangutan, and siamang, including multiple humans, chimps, and gorillas. Partial DNA sequence of the coding regions was also obtained for one eastern lowland gorilla at the semenogelin genes (SEMG1 and SEMG2), which code for the predominant proteins in semen. Patterns of nucleotide variation and inferred protein sequence change were evaluated within and between species. Combining the present data with previous studies demonstrates a high rate of amino acid substitutions, and low intraspecific variation, at seminal proteins in Pan, presumably driven by strong sperm competition. Both gorilla species apparently possess nonfunctional TGM4, SEMG1, and SEMG2 genes, suggesting that gorillas have had low sperm competition, and therefore their current polygynous mating system, for a long time before their divergence. Similarly, orangutans show longstanding stasis at TGM4, which may be interpreted as evidence for an unchanging mating system for most of their evolution after their divergence from African apes. In contrast to the great apes, the data from humans could be interpreted as evidence of fluctuations between different mating systems or alternatively as a relaxed functional constraint in these proteins. It is our hope that this study is a first step toward developing a model to predict ancestral mating systems from extant molecular data to complement interpretations from the fossil record."
Peaceful post-conflict interactions between aggressors and bystanders in captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Palagi, E', 'Chiarugi, E', 'Cordoni, G']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20587,OCT 2008,12,"We observed a colony of lowland gorillas in order to assess the occurrence of Peaceful Post-Conflict Interactions between Aggressors and Bystanders (PPIAB). We compared the dynamics of PPIAB with those of Peaceful Post-Conflict Interactions between Victims and Bystanders (PPIVB), which are directed toward victims. We confirmed the occurrence of PPIAB (mean Triadic Contact Tendency: 41.7%+/- 16.2% SEM) at frequencies comparable to PPIVB. Immature gorillas were responsible for most PPIAB. PPIAB occurred when the bystander was unrelated to either the aggressor or the victim, and when it was a relative of the aggressor. However, affinitive contact rates were higher in the former case. Unlike PPIVB, PPIAB significantly reduced the likelihood of further aggressions within the group, suggesting that they work at an immediate level. Our data also suggest that bystanders decide when a peaceful contact may be too risky; in fact, neither PPIAB nor PPIVB occurred after high-intensity aggressions."
The use of perceptual features in categorization by orangutans (Pongo abelli),"['Marsh, HL', 'MacDonald, SE']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-008-0148-1,OCT 2008,11,"The extent to which categorization of natural classes in animals reflects a generalization based on perceptual similarity versus an abstract conceptual representation remains unclear. Here, two experiments were conducted to identify the perceptual features used by orangutans when categorizing pictures. In Experiment 1, subjects were trained and tested for transfer on a concrete discrimination (gorillas or orangutans vs. other primates). Analysis of performance on both positive and negative exemplars revealed that performance was best on photos with faces, particularly close-ups. Moreover, error trials did not seem to reflect instances of mistaken identity, but rather, exemplars that may have been distracting for other reasons, such as novel coloration or morphology. In Experiment 2, photos were modified to test the effects of various features. Color modifications caused the biggest decrease in performance, and eye modifications also affected performance deleteriously. Therefore, two perceptual features, namely eye regions and color, played a key role in subjects' ability to categorize. However, performance based on an underlying concept cannot be ruled out, because both of these features are highly relevant in terms of defining category membership. Although a subset of features was identified as playing a key role in categorization, these features differed depending on whether feature-use was studied indirectly, as in Experiment 1, or directly, as in Experiment 2."
Do animals live in the present? Current evidence and implications for welfare,"['Mendl, M', 'Paul, ES', 'POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2008.01.013,OCT 2008,11,"The importance of understanding the mental experiences of animals in order to assess their welfare was recognised by the 1965 UK Brambell Committee Report. The report further suggested that the extent to which animals live life in the present moment has a major impact on their capacity for suffering. Limited ability to recall previous events and imagine future ones would protect animals From the worry, 'rumination' and associated emotional disorders that contribute so much to human suffering. We investigate these suggestions in the light of new evidence on the capacity of animals to travel mentally through time, and with reference to the subjective experiences of human amnesic patients who are indeed 'stuck in time', living their lives in the present. The key human abilities for mental time travel are episodic memory and episodic future thinking, characterised by an ability to place events in time (what, where, when (www)), and to consciously recall or imagine these events. Tests of www memory, recollection vs. familiarity memory, single-trial learning, episodic vs. semantic encoding, and forward planning have been used to investigate whether such cognitive systems also exist in animals. The evidence indicates that some studied species show behaviour consistent with the capacity for mental time travel, while others do not. The extent to which animals consciously experience mental time travel remains unknown. In terms of the implications for welfare, research on human amnesics with damage to brain structures involved in episodic memory suggests that animals lacking mental time travel would miss the beneficial consequences of using previous experience to plan and organise future behaviour, but also the detrimental consequences of being able to ruminate on the recalled past and worry about the imagined future. Emotional responses, including future-directed anxiety would be temporally bound by the presence of relevant stimuli or cues and, therefore, potentially short-lived. However past experiences could, through the actions of non-episodic memory systems attributable to other brain structures, still impact on emotional state via (implicit) learning of associations between cues and emotional events. Cumulative effects of past experience on stress response mechanisms and baseline stress or mood states would also be expected to occur. Mental time travel may thus bring both welfare benefits and problems. Absence of this ability by no means releases animals from many effects of the environment, including the past, on their emotional state. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Ranging of Rhinopithecus bieti in the Samage Forest, China. I. Characteristics of Range Use","['Grueter, CC', 'Li, DY', 'van Schaik, CP', 'Ren, BP', 'Long, YC', 'Wei, FW']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-008-9299-9,OCT 2008,19,"We quantified the home range and explored the style of ranging of black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) in the subtropical-temperate montane Samage Forest (part of Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve) in the vicinity of Gehuaqing. Over 14.5 mo, we took positional records of the study band via a GPS receiver at 30-min intervals, and found that they covered an area of 32 km(2). Over a 10-yr period, the group even ranged in an area of 56 km(2), which is among the largest home range estimates for any primate. The large home range was probably due to the combined effects of large group size (N > 400) and forest heterogeneity, with seasonally food-rich areas interspersed with less valuable areas. The subjects did not use their home range uniformly: 29% of the grid cells had more location records than expected based on a uniform distribution, thus representing a core area, albeit a disjunct one. A continuous 1-mo group follow in the fall revealed that the band traveled on average 1.62 km/d and that days of concentrated use of a particular forest block were followed by more extensive marches. Neither climate nor human disturbance parameters correlate significantly with monthly estimates of the group's home range size. Even though there is no significant correlation between temporal availability of plant phenophases and range size, our observations implicate temporal and spatial availability of food as a determinant of home range use of the focal group. Winter, spring, and summer home ranges are equally large: 18.2, 17.8, and 18.6 km(2), respectively. Home range decreased markedly in fall (9.3 km(2)), probably because the band obtained sufficient food resources (fruit) in a smaller area. The large winter range is best attributed to the exploitation of dispersed clumped patches of mature fruits."
Social Influences on Group Membership in Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi,"['Lewis, RJ']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-008-9304-3,OCT 2008,10,"The size and composition of a social group can influence the reproductive success of its members. I examined the hypothesis that residents actively try to manipulate group size and composition in Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi). I collected behavioral data from 21 individuals in 5 social groups from November 2000 to March 2002 in the Kirindy Forest (C.F.P.F.) of western Madagascar. I investigated the affiliative and agonistic behaviors of resident males and females toward other group members to determine whether residents attempt to manipulate the costs and benefits of group membership. I also examined 3 cases of immigration attempts and 1 case of emigration. As expected, group members facilitated the residency of subordinate members of the opposite sex. For example, females sought out the subordinate males, responded to their calls, and even groomed them more. However, intrasexual relationships were also important for establishing or maintaining residency. The data, in conjunction with the observations of immigration and emigration events, suggest that resident individuals of both sexes attempt to influence group size and composition. I suggest that single-male groups are not the norm in Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi because females encourage, and males do not discourage, multiple males to reside in the group to increase group stability and to reduce the risk of infanticide."

Numts can be unintentionally amplified in addition to authentic mtDNA, complicating both the analysis and interpretation of mtDNA-based studies. Amplification of numts creates particular issues for studies on the noncoding, hypervariable 1 mtDNA region of gorillas. We provide data on putative numt sequences of the coding mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII). Via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloning, we obtained COII sequences for gorilla, orangutan, and human high-quality DNA and also from a gorilla fecal DNA sample. Both gorilla and orangutan samples yielded putative numt sequences. Phylogenetically more anciently transferred numts were amplified with a greater incidence from the gorilla fecal DNA sample than from the high-quality gorilla sample. Data on phylogenetically more recently transferred numts are equivocal. We further demonstrate the need for additional investigations into the use of mtDNA markers for noninvasively collected samples from gorillas and other primates."

The results revealed that the presence of zoo visitors significantly influenced the behavior of captive bison and thereby may have affected their welfare."
Food material properties and mandibular load resistance abilities in large-bodied hominoids,"['Taylor, AB', 'Vogel, ER', 'Dominy, NJ']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.04.001,OCT 2008,21,"Numerous comparative studies have sought to demonstrate a functional link between feeding behavior, diet, and mandibular form in primates. In lieu of data on the material properties of foods ingested and masticated, many investigators have relied on qualitative dietary classifications such as ""folivore"" or ""frugivore."" Here we provide the first analysis of the relationship between jaw form, dietary profiles, and food material properties in large-bodied hominoids. We employed ratios of area moments of inertia and condylar area to estimate moments imposed on the mandible in order to evaluate and Compare the relative ability to Counter mandibular loads among central Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii), Virunga mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), and east African chimpanzees (Part troglodytes schweinfurthii). We used data on elastic modulus (E) of fruit, fracture toughness (R) of fruit, leaves, and non-fruit, non-leaf vegetation, and derived fragmentation indices (root R root E and root ER), as proxies for bite force. We generated bending and twisting moments (force x moment arm) for various mandibular loading behaviors using food material properties to estimate minimally required bite forces. Based on E and R of foods ingested and masticated, we hypothesized improved resistance to mandibular loads in Pongo p. wurmbii compared to the African apes, and in G. b. beringei compared to Pan I. schweinfurthii. Results reveal that our predictions are borne out only when bite forces are estimated from maximum R of non-fruit, non-leaf vegetation, For all other tissues and material properties results were contrary to Our predictions. Importantly, as food material properties change, the moments imposed on the mandible change; this, in turn, alters the entire ratio of relative load resistance to moment. The net effect is that species appear over- or under-designed for the moments imposed on the mandible. Our hypothesis, therefore, is Supported only if we accept that maximum R of these vegetative tissues represents the relevant mechanical property influencing the magnitude of neuromuscular activity, food fragmentation, and mandibular morphology. A general implication is that reliable estimates of average and maximum bite forces from food material properties require that the full range of tissues masticated be tested. Synthesizing data on ingestive and masticatory behaviors, the number of chewing cycles associated with a given food, and food mechanical properties, should inform the broader question of which foods and feeding behaviors are most influential on the mandibular loading environment.

A quantitative method for the evaluation of three-dimensional structure of temporal bone pneumatization,"['Hill, CA', 'Richtsmeier, JT']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.03.010,OCT 2008,10,"Temporal bone pneumatization has been included in lists of characters used in phylogenetic analyses of human evolution. While studies suggest that the extent of pneumatization has decreased over the course of human evolution, little is known about the processes underlying these changes or their significance. In short, reasons for the observed reduction and the potential reorganization within pneumatized spaces are unknown. Technological limitations have limited previous analyses of pneumatization in extant and fossil species to qualitative observations of the extent of temporal bone pneumatization. In this paper, we introduce a novel application of quantitative methods developed for the Study of trabecular bone to the analysis of pneumatized spaces of the temporal bone. This method utilizes high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (HRXCT) images and quantitative software to estimate three-dimensional parameters (bone Volume fractions, anisotropy, and trabecular thickness) of bone Structure within defined units of pneumatized spaces. We apply this approach in an analysis of temporal bones of diverse but related primate species, Got-ilia gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Homo sapiens, and Papio hamadryas anubis, to illustrate the potential of these methods. In demonstrating the utility of these methods, we show that there are interspecific differences in the bone Structure of pneumatized spaces, perhaps reflecting changes in the localized growth dynamics, location of muscle attachments, encephalization, or basicranial flexion.

Subdivision in an ancestral species creates asymmetry in gene trees,"['Slatkin, M', 'Pollack, JL']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msn172,OCT 2008,26,"We consider gene trees in three species for which the species tree is known. We show that population subdivision in ancestral species can lead to asymmetry in the frequencies of the two gene trees not concordant with the species tree and, if subdivision is extreme, cause the one of the nonconcordant gene trees to be more probable than the concordant gene tree. Although published data for the human-chimp-gorilla clade and for three species of Drosophila show asymmetry consistent with our model, sequencing error could also account for observed patterns. We show that substantial levels of persistent ancestral subdivision are needed to account for the observed levels of asymmetry found in these two studies."

Moreover, there are six pseudogenes of PKD1 that are located proximal to the master gene in 16p13.1. In contrast, no pseudogene could be detected in the mouse genome, only a single copy gene on chromosome 17. The question arises how the human situation originated phylogenetically. To address this question we applied comparative FISH-mapping of a human PKD1-containing genomic BAC clone and a PKD1-cDNA clone to chromosomes of a variety of primate species and the dog as a non-primate outgroup species.

Results: Comparative FISH with the PKD1-cDNA clone clearly shows that in all primate species studied distinct single signals map in subtelomeric chromosomal positions orthologous to the short arm of human chromosome 16 harbouring the master PKD1 gene. Only in human and African great apes, but not in orangutan, FISH with both BAC and cDNA clones reveals additional signal clusters located proximal of and clearly separated from the PKD1 master genes indicating the chromosomal position of PKD1 pseudogenes in 16p of these species, respectively. Indeed, this is in accordance with sequencing data in human, chimpanzee and orangutan. Apart from the master PKD1 gene, six pseudogenes are identified in both, human and chimpanzee, while only a single-copy gene is present in the whole-genome sequence of orangutan. The phylogenetic reconstruction of the PKD1-tree reveals that all human pseudogenes are closely related to the human PKD1 gene, and all chimpanzee pseudogenes are closely related to the chimpanzee PKD1 gene. However, our statistical analyses provide strong indication that gene conversion events may have occurred within the PKD1 family members of human and chimpanzee, respectively.

Conclusion: PKD1 must have undergone amplification very recently in hominid evolution. Duplicative transposition of the PKD1 gene and further amplification and evolution of the PKD1 pseudogenes may have arisen in a common ancestor of Homo, Pan and Gorilla similar to 8 MYA. Reticulate evolutionary processes such as gene conversion and non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) may have resulted in concerted evolution of PKD1 family members in human and chimpanzee and, thus, simulate an independent evolution of the PKD1 pseudogenes from their master PKD1 genes in human and chimpanzee."
"Fission-fusion dynamics, behavioral flexibility, and inhibitory control in primates","['Amici, F', 'Aureli, F', 'Call, J']",CURRENT BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cub.2008.08.020,SEP 23 2008,113,"The Machiavellian Intelligence or Social Brain Hypothesis explains the evolution of increased brain size as mainly driven by living in complex organized social systems [1-4] in which individuals represent ""moving targets"" who can adopt multiple strategies to respond to one another [5]. Frequently splitting and merging in subgroups of variable composition (fission-fusion or FF dynamics) has been proposed as one aspect of social complexity ([2, 6-9]; compare with [10]) that may be associated with an enhancement of cognitive skills like inhibition [111], which allows the suppression of prepotent but ineffective responses in a changing social environment [7]. We compared the performance of primates experiencing high levels of FF dynamics (chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and spider monkeys) to that of species living in more cohesive groups (gorillas, capuchin monkeys, and long-tailed macaques) [12-13] on five inhibition tasks. Testing species differing in diet, phylogenetic relatedness, and levels of FF dynamics allowed us to contrast ecological, phylogenetic, and socioecological explanations for interspecific differences. Spider monkeys performed at levels comparable to chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans, and better than gorillas. A two-cluster analysis grouped all species with higher levels of FF dynamics together. These findings confirmed that enhanced inhibitory skills are positively associated with FF dynamics, more than to phylogenetic relations or feeding ecology."

The current study has aimed to extend the representation of groups, whose position in the placental tree has been difficult to establish in mitogenomic studies. Both ML (maximum likelihood) and Bayesian analyses identified four basal monophyletic groups, Afroplacentalia (=Afrotheria: Hyracoidea, Proboscidea, Sirenia, Tenrecidea, Tubulidentata, Macroscelidea, Chrysochloridea), Xenarthra, Archontoglires (Primates, Dermoptera, Scandentia, Lagomorpha, Rodentia) and Laurasiaplacentalia (Lipotyphla, Chiroptera, Pholidota, Camivora, Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, Cetacea). All analyses joined Archontoglires and Laurasiaplacentalia on a common branch (Boreoplacentalia), but the relationship between Afroplacentalia, Xenarthra and Boreoplacentalia was not conclusively resolved. The phylogenomic hypothesis with a sister group relationship between Notoplacentalia (Afroplacentalia/Xenarthra) and Boreoplacentalia served as the basis for estimating the times of placental divergences using paleontologically well-supported mammalian calibration points. These estimates placed the basal placental divergence between Boreoplacentalia and Notoplacentalia at approximate to 102 MYA (million years ago). The current estimates of ordinal placental divergences are congruent with recent estimates based on nuclear data, but inconsistent with paleontological notions that have placed the origin of essentially all placental orders within an interval of 5-10 MY in the early Tertiary. Among less deep divergences the estimates placed the split between Gorilla and Pan/Homo at approximate to 11.5 MYA and that between Pan and Homo at approximate to 8 MYA. As a consequence of these estimates, which are in accord with recent progress in primate paleontology, the earliest divergences among recent humans become placed approximate to 270,000 years ago, i.e. approximate to 100,000 years earlier than the traditional age of ""Mitochondrial Eve"". Comparison between the two new mt genomes of Hylomys suillus (short-tailed gymnure) patently demonstrates the inconsistency that may exist between taxonomic designations and molecular difference, as the distance between these two supposedly conspecific genomes exceeds that of the three elephantid genera Elephas, Mammuthus and Loxodonta. In accordance with the progressive use of the term Placentalia for extant orders and extinct taxa falling within this group we forward new proposals for the names of some superordinal clades of placental mammals.

Predictors of reproductive success in female white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus),"['Fedigan, LM', 'Carnegie, SD', 'Jack, KM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20848,SEP 2008,27,"Early investigations into variable reproductive success in nonhuman primates tended to focus on the benefits conferred by high dominance rank. However, the effect of high rank on individual reproductive success has been found to vary both intra- and interspecifically, requiring researchers to expand their investigations to include additional factors. Here we examine the age and rank of the mother, sex of the infant, group size, number of close kin, replacement of group males, and resource availability as possible predictors of female reproductive success in white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) in the Santa Rosa sector of the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, Costa Rica. We examine the length of interbirth intervals (IBI) and infant survivorship as measures of individual reproductive success for the 31 adult females that resided in our three study groups between 1986 and 2007. The greatest predictor of IBI length was whether or not the first infant in the interval survived (number of matrilineal kin and resource availability were also significant predictors); while infant survivorship was most significantly predicted by the occurrence of a turnover in group males in the year following the birth of an infant (infant sex was also a significant factor). Based on these findings, we conclude that male and female reproductive strategies are at odds in this species, with male strategies strongly influencing female reproductive success."
"Effects of habitat fragmentation, population size and demographic history on genetic diversity: The Cross River gorilla in a comparative context","['Bergl, RA', 'Bradleys, BJ', 'Nsubuga, A', 'Vigilant, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20559,SEP 2008,32,"In small and fragmented populations, genetic diversity may be reduced owing to increased levels of drift and inbreeding. This reduced diversity is often associated with decreased fitness and a higher threat of extinction. However, it is difficult to determine when a population has low diversity except in a comparative context. We assessed genetic variability in the critically endangered Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli), a small and fragmented population, using 11 autosomal microsatellite loci. We show that levels of diversity in the Cross River population are not evenly distributed across the three genetically identified subpopulations, and that one centrally located subpopulation has higher levels of variability than the others. All measures of genetic variability in the Cross River population were comparable to those of the similarly small mountain gorilla (G. beringel beringel) populations (Bwindi and Virunga). However, for some measures both the Cross River and mountain gorilla populations show lower levels of diversity than a sample from a large, continuous western gorilla population (Mondika, G. gorilla gorilla). Finally, we tested for the genetic signature of a bottleneck in each of the four populations. Only Cross River showed strong evidence of a reduction in population size, suggesting that the reduction in size of this population was more recent or abrupt than in the two mountain gorilla populations. These results emphasize the need for maintaining connectivity in fragmented populations and highlight the importance of allowing small populations to expand."
Prolactin levels in Western Lowland gorillas,"['Laughlin, S', 'Meehan, T', 'Zinaman, MJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20572,SEP 2008,0,"Hyperprolactinemia is known to cause menstrual irregularity and infertility in humans. However, little is known about the role of prolactin in menstruation and fertility in Western Lowland gorillas. To create a database of prolactin values in gorillas, we have performed immunoassays on serum specimens dating back to 1983 from nine female gorillas at the Brookfield Zoo. We matched these samples with documented behavioral data to correlate menstrual timing. In addition, we ran other reproductive hormones both to aid in determining the phase of the menstrual cycle and to evaluate the effect of the prolactin on suppression of these hormones during the premenarchal and postpartum phases. We found that values for luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol and progesterone cycle in very similar patterns to humans. Based on the 59 available samples, prolactin was found to be higher in gorillas than in humans in nearly every phase of the menstrual cycle (range 49.9-93.7 ng/mL) and such levels do not appear to alter the reproductive axis as it does in humans. Thus, prolactin may have a different impact on fertility in gorillas than it does in humans."
Menopause in nonhuman primates?,"['Walker, ML', 'Herndon, JG', 'POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN']",BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION,10.1095/biolreprod.108.068536,SEP 2008,65,"A gradual alteration in the mechanisms underlying reproduction and fertility characterizes the aging process in human females. These changes culminate in menopause, conventionally defined as a cessation of menstrual cycles that marks the end of reproductive capacity. In fact, a central and defining event in menopause is the discontinuation of ovulation, which is correlated with a number of structural and functional changes in the reproductive axis. Despite several decades of research, a degree of uncertainty remains as to whether nonhuman primates undergo menopause, and whether they are suitable models of human reproductive senescence. We review some of the controversies that have clouded our understanding of reproductive aging in nonhuman primates, including issues of definition, timing, comparability of data from wild versus captive populations, and cross-species comparisons. The existing data support the view that menopause occurs in a number of primate species and is not unique to humans."

Small enterprise often find themselves facing a very difficult set of choices as they consider whether and how they should engage with the MNCs. This article critically evaluates the strategies smaller enterprises are adopting in a globalizing world. The most effective strategy for globalization is through partnerships with local MNC subsidiaries-in their own backyard-which can then be leveraged to generate opportunities on a global scale. This analysis particularly emphasizes the need for small enterprises to use to their advantage the points of difference (i.e., asymmetry) between them and the MNCs with whom they partner."
Tracking and inferring spatial rotation by children and great apes,"['Okamoto-Barth, S', 'Call, J']",DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0012594,SEP 2008,13,"Finding hidden objects in space is a fundamental ability that has received considerable research attention from both a developmental and a comparative perspective. Tracking the rotational displacements of containers and hidden objects is a particularly challenging task. This study investigated the ability of 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-year-old children and great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) to (a) visually track rotational displacements of a baited container on a platform and (b) infer its displacements by using the changes of position or orientation of 3 landmarks: an object on a container, the color of the containers, and the color of the platform on which the containers rested. Great apes and 5-year-old and older children successfully tracked visible rotations, but only children were able to infer the location of a correct cup (with the help of landmarks) after invisible rotations. The ability to use landmarks changed with age so that younger children solved this task only with the most explicit marker on the baited container, whereas older children, particularly 9-year-olds, were able to use landmark orientation to infer correct locations."

A large proportion of travelers to tropical regions are not protected against vaccine-preventable illnesses, and a majority of these travelers demonstrate poor recall of actual vaccination status. Here we characterize self-perceived vaccination status among a large sample of ecotourists at the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre, Sabah, Malaysia. Despite their recognized travel itinerary to view endangered animals, tourists at wildlife sanctuaries are not adequately protected against vaccine-preventable illnesses. Of 633 surveys, over half reported being currently vaccinated against tuberculosis, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, polio, and measles. Fewer participants reported current vaccination status for influenza, rabies, and chickenpox. Despite the fact that the majority of visitors to Sepilok are from temperate regions where influenza is relatively more prevalent, 67.1% of those surveyed with medical-related occupations reported not being currently vaccinated for influenza. Ecotourists concerned about environmental protection are themselves largely unaware of their potential contribution to the spread of diseases to animals. The risks of negatively affecting animal populations must be communicated to all concerned parties, and this may begin by urging travelers to examine their actual vaccination status, particularly as the ecotourism industry continues its rapid expansion, and is seen increasingly as a possible tool to save great ape populations from extinction."

Across species, Broca's area comprises Brodmann's areas 44 and 45. We found that these areas exhibited similar cytoarchitectonic characteristics in all species examined. We analyzed the minicolumnar organization of cells in layer III of Broca's area in 11 human and 9 great ape specimens. A semiautomated method was used to analyze digitized images of histological sections stained for Nissl substance. Horizontal spacing distance and gray level index (GLI; or the area fraction occupied by cells) were quantified in all images. In contrast to area Tpt, the only cortical area for which comparative minicolumnar data have been published previously for humans and one of the great apes, we found no population-level asymmetry, for either horizontal spacing distance or GLI. Only human females exhibited a leftward asymmetry in GLI. GLI was lower in humans than in great apes (P < 0.001), allowing more space for connectivity in layer III. In humans, horizontal spacing distance was greater than in great apes but smaller relative to brain size."
Estimation of hominoid ancestral population sizes under Bayesian coalescent models incorporating mutation rate variation and sequencing errors,"['Burgess, R', 'Yang, Z']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msn148,SEP 2008,77,"Estimation of population parameters for the common ancestors of humans and the great apes is important in understanding our evolutionary history. In particular, inference of population size for the human-chimpanzee common ancestor may shed light on the process by which the 2 species separated and on whether the human population experienced a severe size reduction in its early evolutionary history. In this study, the Bayesian method of ancestral inference of Rannala and Yang (2003. Bayes estimation of species divergence times and ancestral population sizes using DNA sequences from multiple loci. Genetics. 164:1645-1656) was extended to accommodate variable mutation rates among loci and random species-specific sequencing errors. The model was applied to analyze a genome-wide data set of similar to 15,000 neutral loci (7.4 Mb) aligned for human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and macaque. We obtained robust and precise estimates for effective population sizes along the hominoid lineage extending back similar to 30 Myr to the cercopithecoid divergence. The results showed that ancestral populations were 5-10 times larger than modern humans along the entire hominoid lineage. The estimates were robust to the priors used and to model assumptions about recombination. The unusually low X chromosome divergence between human and chimpanzee could not be explained by variation in the male mutation bias or by current models of hybridization and introgression. Instead, our parameter estimates were consistent with a simple instantaneous process for human-chimpanzee speciation but showed a major reduction in X chromosome effective population size peculiar to the human-chimpanzee common ancestor, possibly due to selective sweeps on the X prior to separation of the 2 species."

Handedness was determined with a coordinated bimanual tube test using peanut butter spread on the interior of a PVC tube.

Ectocranial suture closure in Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla: Pattern and phylogeny,"['Cray, J', 'Meindl, RS', 'Sherwood, CC', 'Lovejoy, CO']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20821,AUG 2008,13,"The order in which ectocranial sutures undergo fusion displays species-specific variation among primates. However, the precise relationship between suture closure and phylogenetic affinities is poorly understood. In this study, we used Guttman Scaling to determine if the modal progression of suture closure differs among Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Gorilla gorilla. Because DNA sequence homologies strongly suggest that R troglodytes and Homo sapiens share a more recent common ancestor than either does with G. gorilla, we hypothesized that this phylogenetic relationship would be reflected in the suture closure patterns of these three taxa. Results indicated that while all three species do share a similar lateral-anterior closure pattern, G. gorilla exhibits a unique vault pattern, which, unlike humans and R troglodytes, follows a strong posterior-to-anterior gradient. R troglodytes is therefore more like Homo sapiens in suture synostosis."

A comparison of female mating strategies in Pan troglodytes and Pongo spp.,"['Stumpf, RM', 'Thompson, ME', 'Knott, CD']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-008-9284-3,AUG 2008,13,"Orangutans and chimpanzees differ in many aspects of their mating and social systems. Nevertheless, because both great apes require enormous maternal investment in offspring and because female reproductive potential is limited, female orangutans and chimpanzees should be selective of their mates, yet expected to exhibit anti-infanticide strategies such as mating with multiple males. We review and compare mating patterns in orangutans and chimpanzees to understand how these critical pressures are filtered through the different demands of the socioecology of each species. We highlight the variation in female mating behavior as a function of the proximity of ovulation. We conclude that both genera pursue tactics for paternity confusion by mating with multiple males and by mating cooperatively or even proceptively with nonpreferred partners when conception is unlikely. Mating selectivity is suggested by variation in proceptive behavior toward particular partners and by increased resistance of nonpreferred partners during the periovulatory period. Thus, data for both species support a mixed mating strategy whereby females shift their mating behavior in accordance with ovulatory status to accommodate the competing demands of mate selectivity and paternity confusion."
Feeding competition and agonistic relationships among Bwindi Gorilla beringei,"['Robbins, MM']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-008-9275-4,AUG 2008,21,"Testing predictions of socioecological models, specifically that the types of feeding competition and social relationships female primates exhibit are strongly influenced by the distribution, density, and quality of food resources, requires studies of closely related populations of subjects living under different ecological conditions. I examined feeding competition and the resulting female social relationships in mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, which has ecological conditions distinctive from those where other gorilla populations live. I observed 1 group of gorillas for 29 mo to examine the proportion of time spent foraging on fruit, the relationship between patch size and occupancy patterns of fruit trees, and agonistic interactions. Patch occupancy time while foraging in fruit trees decreased with increasing number of gorillas in a tree and decreasing tree size, suggesting that fruit trees represent limiting patches and can lead to intragroup scramble competition. Gorillas exhibited higher levels of aggression while feeding on fruit versus other food resources, which indicates intragroup contest competition. I observed a linear dominance hierarchy with no bidirectionality via displacements, and a similar hierarchy via aggression, though a notable proportion of the dyads contained 2-way interactions. However, most aggression was of low intensity (vocalizations) and the recipient typically ignored it. Despite differences in ecological conditions and diet between the Virunga Volcanoes and Bwindi, agonistic relationships among females are largely similar in the 2 populations and are best characterized as dispersal individualistic."
Clinical and pathologic manifestation of oesophagostomosis in African great apes: does self-medication in wild apes influence disease progression?,"['Krief, S', 'Jamart, A', 'Mahe, S', 'Leendertz, FH', 'Matz-Rensing, K', 'Crespeau, F', 'Bain, O', 'Guillot, J']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1111/j.1600-0684.2008.00285.x,AUG 2008,24,"Nodular worms (Oesophagostomum spp.) are common intestinal parasites found in cattle, pig, and primates including humans. In human, they are responsible for serious clinical disease called oesophagostomosis resulting from the formation of granulomas, caseous lesions or abscesses in intestinal walls. In wild great apes, the fecal prevalence of this parasite is high, but little information is available concerning the clinical signs and lesions associated. In the present study, we describe six cases of multinodular oesophagostomosis in free-ranging and ex-captive chimpanzees and captive gorillas caused by Oesophagostomum stephanostomum. While severe clinical signs associated with this infection were observed in great apes raised in sanctuaries, nodules found in wild chimpanzees do not seem to affect their health status. One hypothesis to explain this difference would be that in wild chimpanzees, access to natural environment and behavior such as rough leaves swallowing combined with ingestion of plants having pharmacological properties would prevent severe infection and decrease potential symptoms."

The objectives of the study were to collect baseline data in order to document the helminth parasites infecting this group of gorillas and to examine the effects of season and host age-sex class on patterns of parasite infection. In addition to weekly surveys of feces from all group members, fecal samples from 4 identified individuals were examined almost daily. We identified the diagnostic stages of the following parasites: strongylids (Strongylida), Anoplocephala gorillae, Probstmayria sp., Strongyloides fuelleborni, and a trematode. Monthly and daily fluctuations in strongylid egg counts were observed. Infants had lower strongylid egg counts compared with other group members. Both of the silverbacks had higher mean egg counts in the wet season than in the dry season. Examination of fecal samples from identifiable gorillas revealed high day-today variation in strongylid egg counts. No evidence of anthropozoonotic transmission of intestinal helminths was found."
"Personality assessment in the Great Apes: Comparing ecologically valid behavior measures, behavior ratings, and adjective ratings","['Uher, J', 'Asendorpf, JB']",JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PERSONALITY,10.1016/j.jrp.2007.10.004,AUG 2008,50,"Three methods of personality assessment (behavior measures, behavior ratings, adjective ratings) were compared in 20 zoo-housed Great Apes: bonobos (Pan paniscus), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus abelii). To test a new bottom-up approach, the studied trait constructs were systematically generated from the species' behavioral repertoires. The assessments were reliable, temporally stable, and showed substantial cross-method coherence. In most traits, behavior ratings mediated the relations between adjective ratings and behavior measures. Results suggest that high predictability of manifest behavior is best achieved by behavior ratings, not by adjectives. Empirical evidence for trait constructs beyond current personality models points to the necessity of broad and systematic approaches for valid inferences on a species' personality structure.

Genetic identification of elusive animals: re-evaluating tracking and nesting data for wild western gorillas,"['Bradley, BJ', 'Doran-Sheehy, DM', 'Vigilant, L']",JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,10.1111/j.1469-7998.2008.00431.x,AUG 2008,11,"Western gorillas Gorilla gorilla have been exceedingly difficult to habituate to the presence of human observers. Nevertheless, researchers have amassed a wealth of information on population densities and group structure for this ape species by locating and counting the sleeping nests of wild individuals. Such nest-count studies have suggested that western gorilla groups often have multiple silverbacks and these multimale groups occasionally divide into smaller subgroups. However, observational data from forest clearing sites and from a few recently habituated western gorilla groups show no evidence of multimale family groups or of subgrouping. This discrepancy underscores a long-standing question in ape research: How accurately do nesting sites reflect true group compositions? We evaluated these indirect measures of group composition by using DNA from faeces and hair to genetically identify individual gorillas at nesting sites. Samples were collected from unhabituated wild western gorillas ranging near Mondika Research Center in the Central African Republic and Republic of Congo. DNA extracted from these samples was genotyped at up to 10 microsatellite loci and one X-Y homologous locus for sex identification. Individuals were then identified at nesting sites by their unique multilocus genotypes, thus providing a 'molecular census' of individual gorillas. Results confirm that western gorillas often build more than one nest at a nesting site and, thus, nest counts can be highly inaccurate indicators of group size and composition. Indeed, we found that nest counts can overestimate group size by as much as 40%, indicating that true gorilla population numbers are probably lower than those reported from census surveys. This study demonstrates how genetic analysis can be a valuable tool for studying and conserving elusive, endangered animals."
Probe-specific proportion task repetition effects on switching costs,"['Leboe, JP', 'Wong, J', 'Crump, M', 'Stobbe, K']",PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,10.3758/PP.70.6.935,AUG 2008,6,"In two experiments, participants were presented with successive presentations of animal names (e.g., GORILLA, WHALE)-a prime display followed by a probe display. In response to each display, participants judged either the typical habitat or the relative size of those animals, repeating the same task in response to both displays on half of the experimental trials and switching from one task to the other on the other half of trials. Our results demonstrate that switch costs can be reduced when either the probe's identity or its location is predictive of a change in task. This result establishes that the presentation of a stimulus can serve as a rapid cue for facilitating a switch in task, independent of processes occurring bothat the time of the prime task and during the intervening period between the prime and probe tasks. We discuss the implications of these results for prevailing explanations of task switching costs."

In silico expression data indicated that 22 complete HERV-W families from human chromosomes 1-3, 5-8, 10-12, 15,19, and X are randomly expressed in various tissues. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of the HERV-W env gene derived from human chromosome 7q21.2 indicated predominant expression in the human placenta. Several copies of repeat sequences (SINE, LINE, LTR, simple repeat) were detected within the complete or processed pseudo HERV-W of the human, chimpanzee, and rhesus monkey. Compared to other regions (5'LTR, Gag, Gag-Pol, Env, 3'LTR), the repeat family has been mainly integrated into the region spanning the 5'LTRs of Gag (1398 bp) and Pol (3242 bp). FISH detected the HERV-W probe (fosWE1) derived from a gorilla fosmid library in the metaphase chromosomes of all primates (five hominoids, three Old World monkeys, two New World monkeys, and one prosimian), but not in Tupaia. This finding was supported by molecular clock and phylogeny data using the divergence values of the complete HERV-W LTR elements. The data suggested that the HERV-W family was integrated into the primate genome approximately 63 million years (Myr) ago, and evolved independently during the course of primate radiation."
Phylogeny and geography predict pathogen community similarity in wild primates and humans,"['Davies, TJ', 'Pedersen, AB']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rspb.2008.0284,JUL 22 2008,71,"In natural systems, host species are often co-infected by multiple pathogen species, and recent work has suggested that many pathogens can infect a wide range of host species. An important question therefore is what determines the host range of a pathogen and the community of pathogens found within a given host species. Using primates as a model, we show that infectious diseases are more often shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographical region. We find that host relatedness is the best overall predictor of whether two host species share the same pathogens. A higher frequency of pathogen host shifts between close relatives or inheritance of pathogens from a common ancestor may explain this result. For viruses, geographical overlap among neighbouring primate hosts is more important in determining host range. We suggest this is because rapid evolution within viral lineages allows host jumps across larger evolutionary distances. We also show that the phylogenetic pattern of pathogen sharing with humans is the same as that between wild primates. For humans, this means we share a higher proportion of pathogens with the great apes, including chimpanzees and gorillas, because these species are our closest relatives."

In this study, we surveyed the corresponding regions in nonhuman primates. The MAin2 and MBin2 regions were amplified in a total of 37 species from all primate lineages, including samples from 6 simian and 7 prosimian species. MAin2 and MBin2 were successfully amplified for all the simian species but failed to amplify in the prosimians. A series of alleles of MAin2 and MBin2 ranging from 222 by to 254 by and from 224 by to 284 bp, respectively, were identified. Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons were polymorphic for both MAin2 and MBin2. Common marmosets and tamarins were polymorphic for MAin2 only. In the genus Macaca, MBin2 was polymorphic in 15 of the 18 species examined and 2-11 alleles were observed. Conversely, MAin2 was not diverse, exhibiting only 1-2 alleles.

Sleeping tree choice by Bwindi chimpanzees,"['Stanford, CB', ""O'Malley, RC""]",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20539,JUL 2008,14,"Unlike nearly all other nonhuman primates, great apes build sleeping nests. In Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, chimpanzees build nests nightly and also build day nests. We investigated patterns of nest tree use by Bwindi chimpanzees to understand ecological influences on nest tree selection. We analyzed data on 3,414 chimpanzee nests located from 2000 to 2004. Chimpanzees at Bwindi were selective in their use of nest trees. Of at least 163 tree species known to occur in Bwindi [Butynski, Ecological survey of the Impenetrable (Bwindi) Forest, Uganda, and recommendations for its conservation and management. Report to the Government of Uganda, 19841, chimpanzees utilized only 38 species for nesting. Of these, four tree species (Cassipourea sp., Chrysophyllum gorungosanum, Drypetes gerrardii, and Teclea nobilis) accounted for 72.1% of all nest trees. There was considerable variation in nesting frequencies among the top four species between and within years. However, these species were used significantly more often for nesting than other species in 70.9% (39 of 55) of the months of this study. A Spearman rank correlation found no significant relationship between tree abundance and tree species preference. Ninety-three percent of all nests were constructed in food tree species, although not necessarily at the same time the trees bore food items used by chimpanzees. The results indicate that nesting tree species preferences exist. Bwindi chimpanzees' choice of nesting tree species does not appear to be dependent on tree species density or use of the tree for food. We discuss possible reasons for the selectivity in nest trees by the Bwindi population."
Fiber-bound nitrogen in gorilla diets: Implications for estimating dietary protein intake of primates,"['Rothman, JM', 'Chapman, CA', 'Pell, AN']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20540,JUL 2008,23,"Protein is essential for living organisms, but digestibility of crude protein is poorly understood and difficult to predict. Nitrogen is used to estimate protein content because nitrogen is a component of the amino acids that comprise protein, but a substantial portion of the nitrogen in plants may be bound to fiber in an indigestible form. To estimate the amount of crude protein that is unavailable in the diets of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, foods routinely eaten were analyzed to determine the amount of nitrogen bound to the acid-detergent fiber residue. The amount of fiber-bound nitrogen varied among plant parts: herbaceous leaves 14.5 +/- 8.9% (reported as a percentage of crude protein on a dry matter (DM) basis), tree leaves (16.1 +/- 6.7% DM), pith/ herbaceous peel (26.2 +/- 8.9% DM), fruit (34.7 +/- 17.8% DM), bark (43.8 +/- 15.6% DM), and decaying wood (85.2 +/- 14.6% DM). When crude protein and available protein intake of adult gorillas was estimated over a year, 15.1% of the dietary crude protein was indigestible. These results indicate that the proportion of fiber-bound protein in primate diets should be considered when estimating protein intake, food selection, and food/habitat quality."
"Tubes, tables and traps: great apes solve two functionally equivalent trap tasks but show no evidence of transfer across tasks","['Martin-Ordas, G', 'Call, J', 'Colmenares, F']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-007-0132-1,JUL 2008,41,"Previous studies on tool using have shown that presenting subjects with certain modifications in the experimental setup can substantially improve their performance. However, procedural modifications (e.g. trap table task) may not only remove task constraints but also simplify the problem conceptually. The goal of this study was to design a variation of the trap-table that was functionally equivalent to the trap-tube task. In this new task, the subjects had to decide where to insert the tool and in which direction the reward should be pushed. We also administered a trap-tube task that allowed animals to push or rake the reward with the tool to compare the subjects' performance on both tasks. We used a larger sample of subjects than in previous studies and from all the four species of great apes (Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, and Pongo pygmaeus). The results showed that apes performed better in the trap-platform task than in the trap-tube task. Subjects solved the tube task faster than in previous studies and they also preferred to rake in rather than to push the reward out. There was no correlation in the level of performance between both tasks, and no indication of interspecies differences. These data are consistent with the idea that apes may possess some specific causal knowledge of traps but may lack the ability to establish analogical relations between functional equivalent tasks."
"Behavioural responses to photographs by pictorially naive baboons (Papio anubis), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)","['Parron, C', 'Call, J', 'Fagot, J']",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,10.1016/j.beproc.2008.01.019,JUL 2008,19,"This study assessed how pictorially naive nonhuman primates understand pictures. Fifty-five baboons with no prior exposure to pictures were trained to grasp a slice of banana presented against a pebble in a two alternative forced choice task. Post-training testing involved three stimulus pairs: (1) real banana slice vs. its picture, (2) the banana picture vs. a real pebble and (3) banana picture vs. a pebble picture which were presented twice. Preliminary data were also collected on naive gorillas (n = 4) and chimpanzees (n = 7) using the same procedure. Baboons revealed a preference for the food picture in (2) and (3) and often ate this stimulus, but the food item and its picture were accurately discriminated in (1). These results suggest that baboons mistook the pictorial stimulus and its referent, but processed the banana pictures as poor exemplars of the real banana category. Among apes, only gorillas ate the banana pictures, suggesting that picture-object confusion may also occur in this species. Findings are discussed as pertaining to the general issue of representational abilities in nonhuman primates, and its evolution. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Emerging infectious diseases and animal social systems,"['Nunn, CL', 'Thrall, PH', 'Stewart, K', 'Harcourt, AH']",EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,10.1007/s10682-007-9180-x,JUL 2008,21,"Emerging infectious diseases threaten a wide diversity of animals, and important questions remain concerning disease emergence in socially structured populations. We developed a spatially explicit simulation model to investigate whether-and under what conditions-disease-related mortality can impact rates of pathogen spread in populations of polygynous groups. Specifically, we investigated whether pathogen-mediated dispersal (PMD) can occur when females disperse after the resident male dies from disease, thus carrying infections to new groups. We also examined the effects of incubation period and virulence, host mortality and rates of background dispersal, and we used the model to investigate the spread of the virus responsible for Ebola hemorrhagic fever, which currently is devastating African ape populations. Output was analyzed using regression trees, which enable exploration of hierarchical and non-linear relationships. Analyses revealed that the incidence of disease in single-male (polygynous) groups was significantly greater for those groups containing an average of more than six females, while the total number of infected hosts in the population was most sensitive to the number of females per group. Thus, as expected, PMD occurs in polygynous groups and its effects increase as harem size (the number of females) increases. Simulation output further indicated that population-level effects of Ebola are likely to differ among multi-male-multi-female chimpanzees and polygynous gorillas, with larger overall numbers of chimpanzees infected, but more gorilla groups becoming infected due to increased dispersal when the resident male dies. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of social system on the spread of disease in wild mammals."

Evolutionary dynamics of segmental duplications from human Y-chromosomal euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions,"['Kirsch, S', 'Munch, C', 'Jiang, ZS', 'Cheng, Z', 'Chen, L', 'Batz, C', 'Eichler, EE', 'Schempp, W']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.076711.108,JUL 2008,21,"Human chromosomal regions enriched in segmental duplications are subject to extensive genomic reorganization. Such regions are particularly informative for illuminating the evolutionary history of a given chromosome. We have analyzed 866 kb of Y-chromosomal non-palindromic segmental duplications delineating four euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions (Yp11.2/Yp11.1, Yq11.1/Yq11.21, Yq11.23/Yq12, and Yq12/PAR2). Several computational methods were applied to decipher the segmental duplication architecture and identify the ancestral origin of the 41 different duplicons. Combining computational and comparative FISH analysis, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of these regions. Our analysis indicates a continuous process of transposition of duplicated sequences onto the evolving higher primate Y chromosome, providing unique insights into the development of species-specific Y-chromosomal and autosomal duplicons. Phylogenetic sequence comparisons show that duplicons of the human Yp11.2/Yp11.1 region were already present in the macaque-human ancestor as multiple paralogs located predominantly in subtelomeric regions. In contrast, duplicons from the Yq11.1/Yq11.21, Yq11.23/Yq12, and Yq12/PAR2 regions show no evidence of duplication in rhesus macaque, but map to the pericentromeric regions in chimpanzee and human. This suggests an evolutionary shift in the direction of duplicative transposition events from subtelomeric in Old World monkeys to pericentromeric in the human/ape lineage. Extensive chromosomal relocation of autosomal-duplicated sequences from euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions to interstitial regions as demonstrated on the pygmy chimpanzee Y chromosome support a model in which substantial reorganization and amplification of duplicated sequences may contribute to speciation."
"Symphyseal shape variation in extant and fossil hominoids, and the symphysis of Australopithecus bahrelghazali","['Guy, F', 'Mackaye, HT', 'Likius, A', 'Vignaud, P', 'Schmittbuhl, M', 'Brunet, M']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.12.003,JUL 2008,21,"The holotype of the species Australopithecus bahrelghazali is a mandibular fragment preserving left C-P-4 and right I-2-P-4. One of the key features of the A. bahrelghazali mandible is its sagittally and transversally flat anterior region associated with a vertical, bulbous symphysis that is assumed to differ morphologically from the classic, more apelike eastern australopith morphology with its sloping symphysis, developed transverse tori, and distinct genioglossal fossa. Yet, close similarity has been suggested between A. bahrelghazali and A. qfarensis. To date, no metrical comparison of the symphyseal morphology of east and west African australopiths has been performed. For the selected characters, this study attempts to test the following null hypothesis: A. bahrelghazali does not present significant differences from A. afarensis (i.e., A. bahrelghazali vs. A. qfarensis variation does not depart from expected intraspecific variation for hominoid species). Analysis of the mandibular symphysis is difficult to undertake using conventional linear variables since few landmarks are available to make a precise quantitative assessment of its morphology. In addition, while a few studies have used outline-based techniques of analysis to address symphyseal shape variation, none has integrated data on early hominins. We present here a detailed comparative study of variation in the symphyseal outline of A. bahrelghazali and A. qfarensis based on a quantitative characterization by elliptic Fourier coefficients. Original data on symphyseal variation in Pliocene hominins are provided and discussed within a comparative framework of extant and fossil hominoid representatives. We evaluate the relevance of our quantitative data describing the shape of the symphysis for discriminating hominoid taxa, and test for differences in symphyseal shape between A. bahrelghazali and A. afarensis. Elliptic Fourier coefficients appear to be well-suited descriptors for depicting symphyseal variation within hominoids. Our results confirm that symphyseal shape is a good indicator of taxonomic affinity within hominoids, enabling a clear distinction between great apes, early hominins, and modern humans. Furthermore, our results substantiate the unusual pattern of the A. bahrelghazali symphyses compared to A. afarensis and support the specific status of the west African australopith.

Functional ecology and evolution of hominoid molar enamel thickness: Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii and Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii,"['Vogel, ER', 'van Woerden, JT', 'Lucas, PW', 'Atmoko, SSU', 'van Schaik, CP', 'Dominy, NJ']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.12.005,JUL 2008,78,"The divergent molar characteristics of Pongo troglodytes and Pongo pygmaeus provide an instructive paradigm for examining the adaptive form-function relationship between molar enamel thickness and food hardness. Although both species exhibit a categorical preference for ripe fruit over other food objects, the thick enamel and crenulated occlusal surface of Pongo molar teeth predict a diet that is more resistant to deformation (hard) and fracture (tough) than the diet of Pan. We confirm these predictions with behavioral observations of Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii and Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii in the wild and describe the mechanical properties of foods utilized during periods when preferred foods are scarce. Such fallback foods may have exerted a selective pressure on tooth evolution. particularly molar enamel thinness, which is interpreted as a functional adaptation to seasonal folivory and a derived character trait within the hominoid clade. The thick enamel and crenulated occlusal surface of Pongo molars is interpreted as a functional adaptation to the routine consumption of relatively tough and hard foods. We discuss the implications of these interpretations for inferring the diet of hominin species, which possessed varying degrees of thick molar enamel. These data, which are among the first reported for hominoid primates. fill an important empirical void for evaluating the mechanical plausibility of putative hominin food objects.

Articular morphology of the proximal ulna in extant and fossil hominoids and hominins,"['Drapeau, MSM', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.01.005,JUL 2008,21,"Extant hominoids share similar elbow joint morphology, which is believed to be an adaptation for elbow stability through a wide range of pronation-supination and flex ion-extension postures. Mild variations in elbow joint morphology reported among extant hominoids are often qualitative, where orangutans are described as having keeled joints, and humans and gorillas as having flatter joints. Although these differences in keeling are often linked to variation in upper limb use or loading, they have not been specifically quantified. Many of the muscles important in arboreal locomotion in hominoids (i.e., wrist and finger flexors and extensors) take their origins from the humeral epicondyles. Contractions of these muscles generate transverse forces across the elbow, which are resisted mainly by the keel of the humeroulnar joint. Therefore, species with well-developed forearm musculature, like arboreal hominoids, should have more elbow joint keeling than nonarboreal species. This paper explores the three- and two-dimensional morphology of the trochlear notch of the elbow of extant hominoids and fossil hominins and hominoids for which the locomotor habitus is still debated. As expected, the elbow articulation of habitually arboreal extant apes is more keeled than that of humans. In addition, extant knuckle-walkers are characterized by joints that are distally expanded in order to provide greater articular surface area perpendicular to the large loads incurred during terrestrial locomotion with an extended forearm. Oreopithecus is characterized by a pronounced keel of the trochlear notch and resembles Pongo and Pan. OH 36 has a morphology that is unlike that of extant species or other fossil hominins. All other hominin fossils included in this study have trochlear notches intermediate in form between Homo and Gorilla or Pan, suggesting a muscularity that is less than in African apes but greater than in humans.

Monitoring population decline: can transect surveys detect the impact of the Ebola virus on apes?,"['Devos, C', 'Walsh, PD', 'Arnhem, E', 'Huynen, MC']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605308000161,JUL 2008,3,"In 2004 the Ebola virus caused a drastic decline in western gorilla Gorilla gorilla abundance at Lokoue Bai, a clearing in Odzala National Park, Republic of Congo. This decline was detected by observations of gorillas visiting the clearing. We confirm that the sympatric chimpanzee Pan troglodytes Population was also affected by the Ebola Outbreak, and test whether the decline in the ape population would have been detected with line-transect survevs, the most commonly used wildlife monitoring methodology in Central Africa. We also evaluate the potential of transect surveys for describing the extent and pinpointing the timing of drastic population declines when this information is not known from other evidence. Both nest survey using the marked nest count method and standing stock survey of other signs of ape presence (dung, feeding remains, prints) were able to detect the decline. However, only nests and dung were reliable indices for estimating the magnitude of the decline and accurately pinpointing the timing. It was necessary to pool data across many survey replicates because of small samples sizes. Our results suggest that transects methods are able to detect drastic changes in ape abundance but that large sample sizes are necessary to achieve adequate statistical power. We therefore recommend that those intending to use transect methods as tools for monitoring large forest mammals evaluate in advance how much effort will be necessary to detect meaningful changes in animal abundance."

The forest is an isolated fragment of c. 7.5 km(2). Total nest building population size (n = 12.5) and population density (1.67 weaned chimpanzees km(-2)) were estimated from the number of nests observed along line transects. The maximum nest-group size (n = 11) suggests that this population comprises a Single community. The low estimated Population numbers within Ngel Nyaki forest, compounded by the forest's isolated location, highlight the urgent need for conservation action."

Byrne [e.g. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B, Biological Sciences 358:529-536, 2003] has claimed that individuals acquire these skills by means of the so-called program-level imitation, in which the overall sequence of problem-solving steps (not the precise actions) is reproduced. In this study we present western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) with highly similar nettles. Twelve gorillas in three different groups (including also one nettle-naive gorilla) used the same program-level technique as wild mountain gorillas (with differences mainly on the action level). Chimpanzees, orangutans, and bonobos did not show these program-level patterns, nor did the gorillas when presented with a plant similar in structural design but lacking stinging defenses. We conclude that although certain aspects (i.e. single actions) of this complex skill may be owing to social learning, at the program level gorilla nettle feeding derives mostly from genetic predispositions and individual learning of plant affordances."
The evolution of teaching,"['Thornton, A', 'Raihani, NJ']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.12.014,JUN 2008,65,"Teaching has long been a neglected area in animal behaviour, despite its relevance for a wide range of topics. In light of recent evidence for teaching in nonhuman animals, research can begin to examine the conditions under which it may evolve. Here, we make the case for an evolutionary perspective that treats teaching as a form of cooperative behaviour which functions to promote learning in others. We outline its key characteristics and discuss the selection pressures that may favour its evolution. Teaching will be favoured by selection only where the costs to teachers of facilitating learning are outweighed by the long-term fitness benefits they accrue once pupils have learned, and these benefits will be scaled by the ease with which pupils could learn without teaching. This perspective allows us to make predictions as to the distribution of teaching, the forms it may take, and the relation between teaching in humans and other species. We conclude by considering how teaching may best be categorized. We suggest that natural selection is likely to favour different forms of teaching, depending on whether it serves to promote learning of procedural or declarative information.

We analyzed diploid human, non-human primate and rearranged tumor cells by 3D fluorescence in situ hybridization with the aim of investigating the impact of chromosomal structural changes on the nuclear organization of these loci. Overall, their topology was found to be largely conserved between cell types, species and in tumor cells. Early-replicating loci were localized in the nuclear interior, whereas late-replicating loci showed a broader distribution with a higher preference for the periphery than for late-BrdU-incorporation foci. However, differences in the spatial arrangement of early and late loci of chromosome 2, as compared with those from chromosome 5, 7 and 17, argue against replication timing as a major driving force for the 3D radial genome organization in human lymphoblastoid cell nuclei. Instead, genomic properties, and local gene density in particular, were identified as the decisive parameters. Further detailed comparisons of chromosome 7 loci in primate and tumor cells suggest that the inversions analyzed influence nuclear topology to a greater extent than the translocations, thus pointing to geometrical constraints in the 3D conformation of a chromosome territory."

Although some cellular proteins, such as APOBEC3, have been reported to block FVs, no restriction by Trim5 alpha has been described to date. The sensitivity of three FV isolates of human-chimpanzee or prototypic (PFV), macaque (SFVmac), and feline (FFV) origin to a variety of primate Trim5 alpha s was therefore tested. PFV and SFVmac were restricted by Trim5 alpha s from most New World monkeys, but not from other primates, whereas FFV-based vectors were restricted by Trim5 alpha s from the great apes gorilla and orangutan. Trim5 alpha s from Old World monkeys did not restrict any FV isolate tested. Capuchin Trim5 alpha was unique, as it restricted SFVmac and FFV but not PFV. Trim5 alpha specificity for FVs was determined by the B30.2 domain, interestingly involving, in some instances, the same residues of the variable regions previously implicated as major determinants for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 restriction. FVs with chimeric Gags were made to map the viral determinants of sensitivity to restriction. The N-terminal half of the Gag molecule was found to contain the regions that control susceptibility. This region most likely corresponds to the capsid of conventional retroviruses. Due to their unique replication strategy, FVs should provide a valuable new system to examine the mechanism of retroviral restriction by Trim5 alpha."

Since habits of hunting and meat preparation in the bush still persistently expose humans in Africa to SIV infection, new interspecies transmission of these viruses remains a possibility."

Comparing ape densities and habitats in northern congo: Surveys of sympatric gorillas and chimpanzees in the odzala and ndoki regions,"['Devos, C', 'Sanz, C', 'Morgan, D', 'Onononga, JR', 'Laporte, N', 'Huynen, MC']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20514,MAY 2008,21,"The conservation status of western lowland gorillas and central chimpanzees in western equatorial Africa remains largely speculative because many remote areas have never been surveyed and the impact of emergent diseases in the region has not been well documented. In this study, we compared ape densities and habitats in the Lokoue study area in Odzala National Park and the Goualougo Triangle in Nouabale-Ndoki National Park in northern Republic of Congo. Both of these sites have long been considered strongholds for the conservation of chimpanzees and gorillas, but supposedly differ in vegetative composition and relative ape abundance. We compared habitats between these sites using conventional ground surveys and classified Landsat-7 ETM+ satellite images. We present density estimates via both standing-crop and marked-nest methods for the first time for sympatric apes of the Congo Basin. The marked-nest method was effective in depicting chimpanzee densities, but underestimated gorilla densities at both sites. Marked-nest surveys also revealed a dramatic decline in the ape population of Lokou6 which coincided with a local Ebola epidemic. Normal baseline fluctuations in ape nest encounter rates during the repeated passages of marked-nest surveys were clearly distinguishable from a 80% decline in ape nest encounter rates at Lokou6. Our results showed that ape densities, habitat composition, and population dynamics differed between these populations in northern Congo. We emphasize the importance of intensifying monitoring efforts and further refinement of ape survey methods, as our results indicated that even the largest remaining ape populations in intact and protected forests are susceptible to sudden and dramatic declines.

The effects of observer presence on the behavior of Cebus capucinus in Costa Rica,"['Jack, KM', 'Lenz, BB', 'Healan, E', 'Rudman, S', 'Schoof, VAM', 'Fedigan, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20512,MAY 2008,16,"We report on the responses of Cebus capucinus in the Santa Rosa Sector of the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, Costa Rica, to the presence of observers over a 4-week period. Study groups were habituated to different degrees: (1) Cerco de Piedra (CP): continuous observations began in 1984; (2) Exclosure (EX): focus of an 18-month study on males from 1998 to 1999; and (3) NBH: never studied/ followed but the group frequently encounters researchers. We collected three types of data: group scans (group state was coded as calm or agitated at observer presence), focal animal data (observer-directed behaviors were recorded), and fecal cortisol levels. The two less-habituated groups (NBH and EX) differed significantly from the habituated group (CP) in their behavioral and cortisol responses, and they showed an increase in habituation over the study period (agitation and cortisol levels both dropped). Individuals in NBH also decreased their responses to observers during focal follows; however, at the end of the study the responses of the two less-habituated groups (NBH and EX) remained elevated in comparison to the habituated group (Cl?), suggesting the need for further habituation. Unlike capuchin groups that rarely encounter humans, NBH and EX never fled from observers and they rarely emitted observer-directed alarm calls. We suggest that the permanence of habituation and the ability to habituate animals passively through a neutral human presence are both important considerations for researchers conducting studies in areas where animal safety from poachers, etc. cannot be guaranteed.

Effect of positive reinforcement training on physiological and behavioural stress responses in the hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas),"[""O'Brien, JK"", 'Heffernan, S', 'Thomson, PC', 'McGreevy, PD']",ANIMAL WELFARE,NA,MAY 2008,8,"Behavioural and salivary cortisol responses were measured in hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas) (n = 5) undergoing positive reinforcement training (PRT). Compliance was assessed by collecting behavioural data on desirable and undesirable responses during each training session (33-46 training sessions per male). Saliva was collected before implementation of the training programme (3-4 baseline samples per male) and immediately before and ten minutes after a training session (24-53 saliva samples per male). During training, the incidence of leaving the training area, vocolising and threat displays changed across time. Performance of the desired behaviour (holding a target for increasing increments of time) improved for all males during the study period. Concentrations of salivary cortisol were similar for pre-training and post-training collection times, but both were significantly lower than baseline concentrations. The overall decline in undesirable behaviours and the absence of constantly elevated salivary cortisol suggest that PRT had no adverse effects on animal welfare."
Image scoring in great apes,"['Russell, YI', 'Call, J', 'Dunbar, RIM']",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,10.1016/j.beproc.2007.10.009,MAY 2008,28,"'Image scoring' occurs when person A monitors the giving behaviour of person B towards person C. We tested for 'image scoring' in chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans. Subjects passively observed two types of incident: (i) a 'nice' person gave grapes to a human beggar, and (ii) a 'nasty' person refused to give. The subject witnessed both incidents in succession (but was unable to obtain the grapes). Shortly after, the ape had an opportunity to approach one or both human actors (nice/nasty), both of whom were now sitting side-by-side holding grapes. However, neither human offered their grapes if approached. The subject's expectation of which human was more likely to offer food was measured by comparing the proportion of time that subjects spent near each person. Chimpanzees (n = 17) spent significantly more time at the 'nice' window compared to 'nasty'. Also, preference for 'nasty' declined as trials progressed. Results for other apes were not significant.

Mammal distribution in a Central African logging concession area,"['Van Vliet, N', 'Nasi, R']",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,10.1007/s10531-007-9300-5,MAY 2008,18,"We used data collected during a routine forest inventory to prepare a management plan for a logging concession in Gabon to identify the biophysical and human factors that better explain the distribution of mammal species within the logged-over landscape. Results of a Multiple Correspondence Analysis show that the distribution of mammals within the forest concession is more influenced by roads and hunting than by the direct effects of logging. The structure of the canopy and that of the understorey are also important factors explaining the distribution of mammals within the concession. Linear regressions and Spearman correlation tests were computed to assess the significance of the correlation between the probability of encounter for a particular species and the distance from main roads. Small diurnal monkeys were found far from the villages and between 3 and 10 km from the main roads. Elephants were equally found close or far from roads and do not seem to be affected by hunting activities. Red duikers and the yellow back duikers avoided hunted zones and were significantly more abundant far from roads. Other species like gorillas, chimpanzees or forest buffaloes show no negative relationship with distance to roads and were observed close to villages. We show also how using routinely collected data without research purposes, can be used to propose practical recommendations to managers to limit the negative impacts of logging activities within the concession."
Time management in great apes: implications for gorilla biogeography,"['Lehmann, J', 'Korstjens, AH', 'Dunbar, RIM']",EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,NA,MAY 2008,11,"Question: Do individual time budgets constrain a species' biogeographical distribution and group size?

Data studied: We used published data on gorilla behaviour and ecology as well as published climate variables to model their spatial distribution across Africa.

Method: We develop a mathematical model, based on the assumption that time is a fundamental ecological constraint. This novel approach uses the relationships between climatic variables and gorilla ecology and behaviour to calculate maximum ecological tolerable group sizes (and, from these, biogeographical distribution) for gorillas throughout Africa.

Results: We show that the most critical variable limiting the distribution of gorillas is resting time, which in turn is related to the composition of their diet. Thus, the model demonstrates that time constraints on individual behaviour can explain species' biogegraphical distributions as well as group sizes."
"Chimerism, point mutation, and truncation dramatically transformed mast cell delta-tryptases during primate evolution","['Trivedi, NN', 'Raymond, WW', 'Caughey, GH']",JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY,10.1016/j.jaci.2008.01.019,MAY 2008,16,"Background: Tryptases are serine peptidases stored in mast cell granules. Rodents express 2 soluble tryptases, mast cell proteases (MCPs) 6 and 7. Human alpha- and beta-tryptases are orthologs of MCP-6. However, much of the ancestral MCP-7 ortholog was replaced by parts of other tryptases, creating chimeric delta-tryptase. Human delta-tryptase's limited activity is hypothesized to be due to truncation and processing mutations.

Objective: We sought to probe the origins and consequences of mutations in primate delta-tryptases.

Methods: Prosimian (lemur), monkey (macaque), great ape (orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee), and human delta-tryptase genes were identified by means of data mining and genomic sequencing. Resulting genes were analyzed phylogenetically and structurally.

Results: The seminal conversion event generating the delta-tryptase chimera occurred early because all primates studied contain delta-tryptase genes. Truncation, resulting from a nonsense mutation of Trp206, occurred much later, after orangutans and other great apes last shared an ancestor. The Arg-3Gln propeptide mutation occurred most recently, being present in humans and chimpanzees but not in other primates. Surprisingly, the major active tryptase in monkeys is full-length delta-tryptase, not beta-tryptase, which is the main active tryptase in human subjects. Models of macaque delta-tryptase reveal that the segment truncated in human subjects contains antiparallel beta-strands coursing through the substrate-binding cleft, accounting for truncation's drastic effect on activity.

Conclusions: Transformations in the ancestral MCP-7-like gene during primate evolution caused dramatic variations in function. Although delta-tryptases are nearly inactive in humans, they are active and dominant in monkeys."
Inferences about the location of food in capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) in two sensory modalities,"['Sabbatini, G', 'Visalberghi, E', 'DAUBENTONIA-MADAGASCARIENSIS']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/0735-7036.122.2.156,MAY 2008,29,"The authors tested the ability of capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) to make inferences about hidden food. In Experiment 1, we showed the content of 2 boxes, 1 of which was baited (visual condition, VC) or we shook both boxes producing noise from the baited box (auditory condition, AC). Seven subjects (out of 8) were above chance in the VC, whereas only I was above chance in AC. During treatment, by manipulating empty and filled objects subjects experienced the relation between noise and content. When tested again, 7 capuchins were above chance in the VC and 3 in AC. In Experiment 2, we gave visual or auditory information only about the empty box and, consequently, successful choice implied inferential reasoning. All subjects (out of 4) were above chance in the VC, and 2 in the AC. Control tests ruled out the possibility that success resulted from simply avoiding the shaken noiseless box, or from the use of arbitrary auditory information. Similar to apes (Call, 2004), capuchins were capable of inferential reasoning."

Individuals were presented with pairs of quantities ranging between 0 and 6 food items. Prior to testing, some experienced apes had solved this task using 2 quantities while others were totally naive. Experienced apes transferred their ability to multiple-novel pairs after 6 to 19 months had elapsed since their initial testing. Two out of 6 naive apes (1 chimpanzee, 1 bonobo) solved the task-a proportion comparable to that of a previous study using 2 pairs of quantities. Their acquisition speed was also comparable to the successful subjects from that study. The ratio between quantities explained a large portion of the variance but affected naive and experienced individuals differently. For smaller ratios, naive individuals were well below 50% correct and experienced ones were well above 50%, yet both groups tended to converge toward 50% for larger ratios. Thus, some apes require no procedural modifications to overcome their strong bias for selecting the larger of 2 quantities."

This study explored the color preferences of two species of ape, which, like humans, possess trichromatic color vision. Six western lowland gorillas, and six chimpanzees, housed in Belfast Zoological Gardens, were exposed to three stimuli (cloths, boxes, sheets of acetate) in red, blue, and green. Six stimuli of the same nature, in each of the three colors, were provided to both species for 5 days per stimulus. The amount of interest that the animals showed toward each stimulus of each color was recorded for 1 hr. Results showed that the apes, both when analyzed as two separate groups, and when assessed collectively, showed significant color preferences, paying significantly less attention to the red-, than to the blue- or green-colored stimuli. The animals' interest in the blue- and green-colored stimuli did not differ significantly. Overall, the findings suggest that gorillas and chimpanzees, our closest living relatives, may harbor color preferences comparable to those of humans and other species."

After being given experience on an initial problem, monkeys can transfer their skill to tools of different shapes while ignoring irrelevant tool changes (e.g., color). In contrast, monkeys without initial training perform poorly on the same tasks. Compared to most monkeys, great apes show a clear propensity for tool using and may not require as much experience to succeed on tool functionality tasks. We investigated this question by presenting 171 apes (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla gorilla, and Pongo pygmaeus) with several tool-use problems without giving them initial training or familiarizing them with the test materials. Apes succeeded without experience, but only on problems based on basic properties such as the reward being supported by an object. However, only minimal experience was sufficient to allow them to quickly improve their performance on more complex problems in which the reward was not in contact with the tool."

After extracting and purifying from agarose gels, PCR products were sequenced and then spliced by using BioEdit. All the FKN sequences were aligned and compared the percent identity by using DNAStar. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using maximum evolution approach in Mega. The negative selection sites were analyzed by using Datamonkey. There is an apparent 30 bp nucleotides deletion mutation in homonids FKN comparing to that of Old World Monkeys besides other point mutations. Homology of nucleotide sequence between human and chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, macaque and leaf monkey is 99.2%, 98.4%, 98.1%, 96.5%, 95.9% and 93.8%, respectively.

In the same time, the genealogical relationship of human is a lot closer to chimpanzee than it is to gorilla and other apes. It is generally agreed that the evolution rule of FKN gene is in accord with that of the higher primates. In addition, Datamonkey shows that there are 3 negative selection sites 53Q, 84D and 239N in FKN. The full-length FKN gene of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, macaque and leaf monkey were sequenced successfully, and the FKN sequences analysis lays the foundation for further studying its evolution in immunological function in higher primates and the relation between its structure and function."
Influence of male morphology on male mating status and behavior during interunit encounters in western lowland gorillas,"['Caillaud, D', 'Levrero, F', 'Gatti, S', 'Menard, N', 'Raymond, M']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20754,APR 2008,30,"The western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) is one of the most sexually dimorphic primate species. Mature males are twice the size of females and have grey fur on their backs and a fibrous, adipose crest on their heads. Such traits are likely to have evolved by sexual selection, either because they confer advantages during male-male fights or because females prefer males with more dimorphic traits. We developed photogrammetric methods for distance collection of morphological data from silverback males frequenting the Lokoue forest clearing in Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Republic of the Congo. Body length, head-crest size, musculature development, and extent of the grey color on the back were assessed in 87 nonbreeding and breeding mature males. Behavioral data were also collected during 312 male-male encounters involving 67 mature males in order to estimate their level of aggressiveness. The number of females belonging to a mature male positively correlated with the male crest size, body length, and musculature. Whereas morphological variables did not significantly affect the intensity of male-male encounters, the number of females attending male-male encounters strongly affected the number of agonistic displays by the two males. We discuss the mechanisms through which males with more exaggerated traits could obtain a mating advantage, namely male-male fights or female mate choice."
Arboreal nesting as anti-predator adaptation by savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in southeastern Senegal,"['Pruetz, JD', 'Fulton, SJ', 'Marchant, LF', 'Mcgrew, WC', 'Schiel, M', 'Waller, M']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20508,APR 2008,24,"Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) make nests for resting and sleeping, which is unusual for anthropoid primates but common to all great apes. Arboreal nesting has been linked to predation pressure, but few studies have tested the adaptive nature of this behavior. We collected data at two chimpanzee study sites in southeastern Senegal that differed in predator presence to test the hypothesis that elevated sleeping platforms are adaptations for predator defense. At Assirik in the Parc National du Niokolo-Koba, chimpanzees face four species of large carnivore, whereas at Fongoli, outside national park boundaries, humans have exterminated almost all natural predators. We quantified the availability of vegetation at the two sites to test the alternative hypothesis that differences in nesting reflect differences in habitat structure. We also examined possible sex differences in nesting behavior, community demographic differences, seasonality and nest age differences as variables also potentially affecting nest characteristics and nesting behavior between the two sites. Chimpanzees at Fongoli nested at lower heights and farther apart than did chimpanzees at Assirik and sometimes made nests on the ground. The absence of predators outside of the national park may account for the differences in nest characteristics at the two sites, given the similarities in habitat structure between Fongoli and Assirik. However, Fongoli chimpanzees regularly build arboreal nests for sleeping, even under minimal predation pressure, and this requires explanation."

Group differences in captive gorillas' reaction to large crowds,"['Kuhar, CW']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2007.04.011,APR 2008,20,"The impact of visitor crowd size on captive animal behaviour can be difficult to interpret in many institutions due to the lack of variation in crowd size over short periods of time. In attempts to compare greater variation in crowd size, animal behaviour is often compared over conditions that create additional confounds, such as day of week or season. Fluctuations in attendance over the holiday season at Disney's Animal Kingdom (R) Theme Park provided an opportunity to examine the impact of variation in crowd size on gorilla behaviour without the confounds found in many other studies. Ten western lowland gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla) in a bachelor group (n = 4) and a family group (n = 6) were observed over a period of 8 weeks in late 2005. Observations were classified into Large Crowd and Small Crowd days and a repeated-measures ANOVA procedure was conducted to determine the effects of crowd size and social group on gorilla behaviour patterns. Few overall differences were found in behaviour during the Large Crowd and Small Crowd conditions. However, similar to previous research, gorillas were less visible during the Large Crowd condition (F-1,F-8 = 14.15, P = 0.01). There was also an interaction of crowd size and group (F-1,F-8 = 7.58, P = 0.01), indicating the bachelor group of gorillas was more aggressive during the Large Crowd condition, whereas the family group showed no increase in aggression with large crowds. These results indicate the importance of providing complex enclosures with visual barriers to allow animals to move away from large crowds if they choose. Future research should focus on the individual characteristics of animals and enclosures that may contribute to behavioural differences in visitor-animal interaction research, as well as the proximate cues associated with behaviour change when exposed to large crowds.

Mechanical analysis of infant carrying in hominoids,"['Amaral, LQ']",NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN,10.1007/s00114-007-0325-0,APR 2008,4,"In all higher nonhuman primates, species survival depends upon safe carrying of infants clinging to body hair of adults. In this work, measurements of mechanical properties of ape hair (gibbon, orangutan, and gorilla) are presented, focusing on constraints for safe infant carrying. Results of hair tensile properties are shown to be species-dependent. Analysis of the mechanics of the mounting position, typical of heavier infant carrying among African apes, shows that both clinging and friction are necessary to carry heavy infants. As a consequence, a required relationship between infant weight, hair-hair friction coefficient, and body angle exists. The hair-hair friction coefficient is measured using natural ape skin samples, and dependence on load and humidity is analyzed. Numerical evaluation of the equilibrium constraint is in agreement with the knuckle-walking quadruped position of African apes. Bipedality is clearly incompatible with the usual clinging and mounting pattern of infant carrying, requiring a revision of models of hominization in relation to the divergence between apes and hominins. These results suggest that safe carrying of heavy infants justify the emergence of biped form of locomotion. Ways to test this possibility are foreseen here."
The evolutionary role of modularity and integration in the hominoid cranium,"['Mitteroecker, P', 'Bookstein, F', 'MAMMALIAN SKULL VAULT']",EVOLUTION,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00321.x,APR 2008,111,"Patterns of morphological integration and modularity among shape features emerge from genetic and developmental factors with varying pleiotropic effects. Factors or processes affecting morphology only locally may respond to selection more easily than common factors that may lead to deleterious side effects and hence are expected to be more conserved. We briefly review evidence for such global factors in primate cranial development as well as for local factors constrained to either the face or the neurocranium. In a sample comprising 157 crania of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Gorilla gorilla, we statistically estimated common and local factors of shape variation from Procrustes coordinates of 347 landmarks and semilandmarks. Common factors with pleiotropic effects on both the face and the neurocranium account for a large amount of shape variation, but mainly by extension or truncation of otherwise conserved developmental pathways. Local factors (modular shape characteristics) have more degrees of freedom for evolutionary change than mere ontogenetic scaling. Cranial shape is similarly integrated during development in all three species, but human evolution involves dissociation among several characteristics. The dissociation has probably been achieved by evolutionary alterations and by the novel emergence of local factors affecting characteristics that are controlled at the same time by the common factors."
Using dung to estimate gorilla density: Modeling dung production rate,"['Todd, AF', 'Kuehl, HS', 'Cipolletta, C', 'Walsh, PD']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-008-9247-8,APR 2008,10,"There is an urgent need for information on western gorilla population sizes and distribution to improve present and plan future conservation actions. Researchers traditionally have estimated gorilla densities on the basis of nest counts despite demonstrated variation in nest production and decay rates. The variation may lead to large biases in estimates of gorilla abundance. We investigated the use of an alternate index of gorilla abundance, via defecation data collected from habituated gorillas at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic. Our sample of 274/370 defecation events/dung piles produced a production rate of ca. 5 dung piles/d: comparable to previous estimates based on much smaller sample sizes. Heuristic models that failed to account for imperfect dung pile detection produced a lower defecation rate estimate than that of a maximum likelihood model that explicitly modeled detection probability. Generalized linear modeling (GLM) showed that dung pile production rate was strongly linked to rainfall, suggesting that failure to correct for seasonal variation in dung pile production rates could lead to substantial biases in gorilla abundance estimates. In our study, failing to distinguish between the number of defecation events and the number of dung piles produced would lead to a ca. 31% overestimate of true gorilla numbers. The use of dung as an index of gorilla abundance shows potential, but more fieldwork and modeling on seasonal variation in dung production rates is required."
Reconstructing phylogenies and phenotypes: a molecular view of human evolution,"['Bradley, BJ']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2007.00840.x,APR 2008,37,"This review broadly summarizes how molecular biology has contributed to our understanding of human evolution. Molecular anthropology began in the 1960s with immunological comparisons indicating that African apes and humans were closely related and, indeed, shared a common ancestor as recently as 5 million years ago. Although initially dismissed, this finding has proven robust and numerous lines of molecular evidence now firmly place the human-ape divergence at 4-8 Ma. Resolving the trichotomy among humans, chimpanzees and gorillas took a few more decades. Despite the readily apparent physical similarities shared by African apes to the exclusion of modern humans (body hair, knuckle-walking, thin tooth enamel), the molecular support for a human-chimpanzee clade is now overwhelming. More recently, whole genome sequencing and gene mapping have shifted the focus of molecular anthropology from phylogenetic analyses to phenotypic reconstruction and functional genomics. We are starting to identify the genetic basis of the morphological, physiological and behavioural traits that distinguish modern humans from apes and apes from other primates. Most notably, recent comparative genomic analyses strongly indicate that the marked differences between modern humans and chimpanzees are likely due more to changes in gene regulation than to modifications of the genes themselves, an idea first proposed over 30 years ago. Almost weekly, press releases describe newly identified genes and regulatory elements that seem to have undergone strong positive selection along the human lineage. Loci involved in speech (e.g. FOXP2), brain development (e.g. ASPM), and skull musculature (e.g. MYH16) have been of particular interest, but some surprising candidate loci (e.g. those involved in auditory capabilities) have emerged as well. Exciting new research avenues, such as the Neanderthal Genome Project, promise that molecular analyses will continue to provide novel insights about our evolution. Ultimately, however, these molecular findings can only be understood in light of data from field sites, morphology labs, and museum collections. Indeed, molecular anthropology depends on these sources for calibrating molecular clocks and placing genetic data within the context of key morphological and ecological transitions in human evolution."
Hominin life history: reconstruction and evolution,"['Robson, SL', 'Wood, B', 'SOUTH-AFRICAN AUSTRALOPITHECINES']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2008.00867.x,APR 2008,125,"In this review we attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary history of hominin life history from extant and fossil evidence. We utilize demographic life history theory and distinguish life history variables, traits such as weaning, age at sexual maturity, and life span, from life history-related variables such as body mass, brain growth, and dental development. The latter are either linked with, or can be used to make inferences about, life history, thus providing an opportunity for estimating life history parameters in fossil taxa. We compare the life history variables of modern great apes and identify traits that are likely to be shared by the last common ancestor of Pan-Homo and those likely to be derived in hominins. All great apes exhibit slow life histories and we infer this to be true of the last common ancestor of Pan-Homo and the stem hominin. Modern human life histories are even slower, exhibiting distinctively long post-menopausal life spans and later ages at maturity, pointing to a reduction in adult mortality since the Pan-Homo split. We suggest that lower adult mortality, distinctively short interbirth intervals, and early weaning characteristic of modern humans are derived features resulting from cooperative breeding. We evaluate the fidelity of three life history-related variables, body mass, brain growth and dental development, with the life history parameters of living great apes. We found that body mass is the best predictor of great ape life history events. Brain growth trajectories and dental development and eruption are weakly related proxies and inferences from them should be made with caution. We evaluate the evidence of life history-related variables available for extinct species and find that prior to the transitional hominins there is no evidence of any hominin taxon possessing a body size, brain size or aspects of dental development much different from what we assume to be the primitive life history pattern for the Pan-Homo clade. Data for life history-related variables among the transitional hominin grade are consistent and none agrees with a modern human pattern. Aside from mean body mass, adult brain size, crown and root formation times, and the timing and sequence of dental eruption of Homo erectus are inconsistent with that of modern humans. Homo antecessor fossil material suggests a brain size similar to that of Homo erectus s. s., and crown formation times that are not yet modern, though there is some evidence of modern human-like timing of tooth formation and eruption. The body sizes, brain sizes, and dental development of Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis are consistent with a modern human life history but samples are too small to be certain that they have life histories within the modern human range. As more life history-related variable information for hominin species accumulates we are discovering that they can also have distinctive life histories that do not conform to any living model. At least one extinct hominin subclade, Paranthropus, has a pattern of dental life history-related variables that most likely set it apart from the life histories of both modern humans and chimpanzees."
The evolutionary history of the hominin hand since the last common ancestor of Pan and Homo,"['Tocheri, MW', 'Orr, CM', 'Jacofsky, MC', 'Marzke, MW', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS HAND']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2008.00865.x,APR 2008,70,"Molecular evidence indicates that the last common ancestor of the genus Pan and the hominin clade existed between 8 and 4 million years ago (Ma). The current fossil record indicates the Pan-Homo last common ancestor existed at least 5 Ma and most likely between 6 and 7 Ma. Together, the molecular and fossil evidence has important consequences for interpreting the evolutionary history of the hand within the tribe Hominini (hominins). Firstly, parsimony supports the hypothesis that the hand of the last common ancestor most likely resembled that of an extant great ape overall (Pan, Gorilla, and Pongo), and that of an African ape in particular. Second, it provides a context for interpreting the derived changes to the hand that have evolved in various hominins. For example, the Australopithecus afarensis hand is likely derived in comparison with that of the Pan-Homo last common ancestor in having shorter fingers relative to thumb length and more proximo-distally oriented joints between its capitate, second metacarpal, and trapezium. This evidence suggests that these derived features evolved prior to the intensification of stone tool-related hominin behaviors beginning around 2.5 Ma. However, a majority of primitive features most likely present in the Pan-Homo last common ancestor are retained in the hands of Australopithecus, Paranthropus/early Homo, and Homo floresiensis. This evidence suggests that further derived changes to the hands of other hominins such as modern humans and Neandertals did not evolve until after 2.5 Ma and possibly even later than 1.5 Ma, which is currently the earliest evidence of Acheulian technology. The derived hands of modern humans and Neandertals may indicate a morphological commitment to tool-related manipulative behaviors beyond that observed in other hominins, including those (e.g. H. floresiensis) which may be descended from earlier tool-making species."
Interspecies and intraspecies variations in the serotonin transporter gene intron 3 VNTR in nonhuman primates,"['Inoue-Murayama, M', 'Hibino, E', 'Iwatsuki, H', 'Inoue, E', 'Hong, KW', 'Nishida, T', 'Hayasaka, I', 'Ito, S', 'Murayama, Y']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-007-0077-7,APR 2008,11,"A variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism based on a 16 or 17-bp unit has been reported in the third intron of the human serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT). VNTRs have been shown to affect the transcriptional activity of genes, and VNTR polymorphisms possibly influence human personality and several psychoneurological disorders. To estimate the changes that occurred in the VNTRs during primate evolution, we amplified and sequenced the regions that corresponded to the human VNTRs in various primate species, including apes, Old World monkeys, and New World monkeys. The VNTR sequences were polymorphic in all the ape species examined, and alleles with repeat numbers of 18, 19, 23, and 24 in chimpanzees, 33, 35, 36, 38, and 40 in gorillas, 4 and 6 in orangutans, and 11, 13, 14, and 15 in gibbons were found. On the other hand, only a 5-repeat allele was detected in Old World monkeys such as the Japanese macaque and patas monkey. In this study we demonstrated for the first time that a repeat structure was not present in the corresponding regions in the New World monkeys examined, and only one unit sequence was found in them. These results suggested that the duplication of a unit in the VNTR region occurred in the Cercopithecidae species following the divergence of the Old World and New World monkeys, and various long repeated alleles were generated in humans and apes, except orangutans."

The approach is illustrated on a set of ND6 proteins of eight species."
Evolution of the DAZ gene and the AZFc region on primate Y chromosomes,"['Yu, YH', 'Lin, YW', 'Yu, JF', 'Schempp, W', 'Yen, PH']",BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1186/1471-2148-8-96,MAR 26 2008,16,"Background: The Azoospermia Factor c (AZFc) region of the human Y chromosome is a unique product of segmental duplication. It consists almost entirely of very long amplicons, represented by different colors, and is frequently deleted in subfertile men. Most of the AZFc amplicons have high sequence similarity with autosomal segments, indicating recent duplication and transposition to the Y chromosome. The Deleted in Azoospermia (DAZ) gene within the red-amplicon arose from an ancestral autosomal DAZ-like (DAZL) gene. It varies significantly between different men regarding to its copy number and the numbers of RNA recognition motif and DAZ repeat it encodes. We used Southern analyses to study the evolution of DAZ and AZFc amplicons on the Y chromosomes of primates.

Results: The Old World monkey rhesus macaque has only one DAZ gene. In contrast, the great apes have multiple copies of DAZ, ranging from 2 copies in bonobos and gorillas to at least 6 copies in orangutans, and these DAZ genes have polymorphic structures similar to those of their human counterparts. Sequences homologous to the various AZFc amplicons are present on the Y chromosomes of some but not all primates, indicating that they arrived on the Y chromosome at different times during primate evolution.

Conclusion: The duplication and transposition of AZFc amplicons to the human Y chromosome occurred in three waves, i.e., after the branching of the New World monkey, the gorilla, and the chimpanzee/bonobo lineages, respectively. The red-amplicon, one of the first to arrive on the Y chromosome, amplified by inverted duplication followed by direct duplication after the separation of the Old World monkey and the great ape lineages. Subsequent duplication/ deletion in the various lineages gave rise to a spectrum of DAZ gene structure and copy number found in today's great apes."
Orrorin tugenensis femoral morphology and the evolution of hominin bipedalism,"['Richmond, BG', 'Jungers, WL', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",SCIENCE,10.1126/science.1154197,MAR 21 2008,81,"Bipedalism is a key human adaptation and a defining feature of the hominin clade. Fossil femora discovered in Kenya and attributed to Orrorin tugenensis, at 6 million years ago, purportedly provide the earliest postcranial evidence of hominin bipedalism, but their functional and phylogenetic affinities are controversial. We show that the O. tugenensis femur differs from those of apes and Homo and most strongly resembles those of Australopithecus and Paranthropus, indicating that O. tugenensis was bipedal but is not more closely related to Homo than to Australopithecus. Femoral morphology indicates that O. tugenensis shared distinctive hip biomechanics with australopiths, suggesting that this complex evolved early in human evolution and persisted for almost 4 million years until modifications of the hip appeared in the late Pliocene in early Homo."

Patterns of paternity and group fission in wild multimale mountain gorilla groups,"['Nsubuga, AM', 'Robbins, MM', 'Boesch, C', 'Vigilant, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20740,MAR 2008,23,"To understand variation among social systems, it is essential to know the relative reproductive success of individuals in group-living species. Particularly interesting for such studies are taxa such as mountain gorillas in which both one-male and multimale groups are common, because of the opportunity to estimate the costs and benefits to males of pursuing different reproductive strategies. We genotyped 68 individuals from two groups of multimale mountain gorilla groups in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda to determine the distribution of paternity among the males. In both groups, the dominant male sired the majority of offspring. One group underwent a fission, and we found that the eight offspring assigned to the dominant silverback (and their mothers) remained with their father, while the two offspring of unknown paternity ended up in the small group headed by the formerly subordinate silverback. This is consistent with the proposal that the outcome of group fission in primates is not only influenced by maternal relationships among individuals, but also by patrilineal relationships. Results of this study show that subordinate males may gain reproductive benefits even while queuing for dominance status. Despite ecological differences between Bwindi and the Virunga Volcanoes, male mountain gorillas living in both populations benefit from remaining in multimale groups."
Strong postcranial size dimorphism in Australopithecus afarensis: Results from two new resampling methods for multivariate data sets with missing data,"['Gordon, AD', 'Green, DJ', 'Richmond, BG']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20745,MAR 2008,39,"There is considerable debate over the level of size dimorphism and inferred social behavior of Australopithecus afarensis. Most previous studies have analyzed size variation in single variables or multiple variables drawn from single elements. These approaches suffer from small sample sizes, underscoring the need for new techniques that incorporate measurements from multiple unassociated elements, reducing the influence of random sampling on size variation in fossil samples. One such technique, the template method, has recently been proposed but is limited to samples with a template specimen and is sensitive to a number of assumptions. Here we present two new resampling methods that do not require a template specimen, allow measurements from multiple unassociated elements to be included in a single analysis, and allow for significance tests between comparative and fossil multivariate data sets with missing data. Using these new methods, multivariate postcranial size dimorphism is measured using eight measurements of the femur, tibia, humerus, and radius in samples of A. afarensis, modern humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. Postcranial dimorphism in A. afarensis is similar to that of gorillas and orangutans, and significantly greater than in modern humans and chimpanzees. Because studies in living primates have examined the association of behavior with dimorphism in body mass and craniodental measurements, not postcrania, relationships between postcranial dimorphism and social behavior must be established to make robust behavioral inferences for A. afarensis. However, the results of this and past studies strongly suggest behavioral and mating strategies differed between A. afarensis and modern humans."
Molecular mechanisms of chromosomal rearrangement during primate evolution,"['Kehrer-Sawatzki, H', 'Cooper, DN']",CHROMOSOME RESEARCH,10.1007/s10577-007-1207-1,MAR 2008,44,"Breakpoint analysis of the large chromosomal rearrangements which have occurred during primate evolution promises to yield new insights into the underlying mechanisms of mutagenesis. Comparison of these evolutionary breakpoints with those that are disease-associated in humans, and which occur during either meiotic or mitotic cell division, should help to identify basic mechanistic similarities as well as differences. It has recently become clear that segmental duplications (SDs) have had a very significant impact on genome plasticity during primate evolution. In comparisons of the human and chimpanzee genomes, SDs have been found in flanking regions of 70-80% of inversions and similar to 40% of deletions/duplications. A strong spatial association between primate-specific breakpoints and SDs has also become evident from comparisons of human with other mammalian genomes. The lineage-specific hyperexpansion of certain SDs observed in the genomes of human, chimpanzee, gorilla and gibbon is indicative of the intrinsic instability of some SDs in primates. However, since many primate-specific breakpoints map to regions lacking SDs, but containing interspersed high-copy repetitive sequence elements such as SINEs, LINEs, LTRs, alpha-satellites and (AT) (n) repeats, we may infer that a range of different molecular mechanisms have probably been involved in promoting chromosomal breakage during the evolution of primate genomes."

Animal consciousness,"['Beshkar, M']",JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES,NA,MAR 2008,3,"There are several types of behavioural evidence in favour of,the. notion that many animal species experience at least some simple levels of consciousness. Other than behavioural evidence, there are a number of anatomical and physiological criteria that help resolve the problem of animal consciousness, particularly when addressing the problem in lower vertebrates and invertebrates.

In this paper I review a number of such behavioural and brain-based evidence in the case of mammals, birds, and some invertebrate species. Cumulative evidence strongly suggests that consciousness, of one form or another is present in mammals and birds. Although supportive evidence is less strong in the case of invertebrates, it is more likely than not that they also experience some simple levels of consciousness."
New hand bones of Hadropithecus stenognathus: implications for the paleobiology of the Archaeolemuridae,"['Lemelin, P', 'Hamrick, MW', 'Richmond, BG', 'Godfrey, LR', 'Jungers, WL', 'Burney, DA']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.09.010,MAR 2008,8,"A partial, associated skeleton of Hadropithecus stenognathus (AHA-I) was discovered in 2003 at Andrahomana Cave in southeastern Madagascar. Among the postcranial elements found were the first hand bones (right scaphoid, right hamate, left first metacarpal, and right and left fifth metacarpals) attributed to this rare subfossil lemur. These hand bones were compared to those of extant strepsirrhines and catarrhines in order to infer the positional adaptations of Hadropithecits, and they were compared to those of Archaeolemur in order to assess variation in hand morphology among archaeolemurids. The scaphoid tubercle does not project palmarly as in suspensory and climbing taxa, and the hamate has no hook at all Oust a small tubercle), which also points to a poorly developed carpal tunnel. There is a distinctive, radioulnarly directed ""spiral"" facet for articulation with the triquetrum that is most similar in orientation to that of more terrestrial primates (i.e., Lemur catta, Papio, and Gorilla). The first metacarpal is very reduced and represents only 48% of the length of metacarpal V, as in Archaeolemur, which suggests that pollical grasping of arboreal supports was not important. Compared to Archaeolemur, the shaft of metacarpal V is gracile, and the head has no dorsal ridge and lacks characteristics functionally associated with digitigrade, extended metacarpophalangeal joint postures. Proximally, the articular facet for the hamate is oriented more dorsally. Thus, the carpometacarpal joint V appears to have a distinctive hyperextended set, which has no analog among living or extinct primates. The carpals of Hadropithecus are diagnostic of a pronograde, arboreal and terrestrial (although not digitigrade) locomotor repertoire that typifies Lemur catta and some Old World monkeys. No clinging, suspensory, or climbing specializations that characterize indriids or lorises can be found in the hand of this subfossil lemur. The hand of Hadropithecus likely had similar ranges of movement at the radiocarpal and midcarpal joints as of those of pronograde primates, such as lemurids, for which the hand is held in a more extended, pronated, and neutral (i.e., showing less ulnar deviation) position during locomotion in comparison to that of vertical clingers or slow climbers. Although highly autapomorphic, the hand of Hadropithecus resembles that of its sister taxon, Archaeolemur, in having a very reduced pollex and an articular facet on the scaphoid for a sizeable prepollex. These unusual hand features reinforce the monophyly of the Archaeolemuridae. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

In humans, four types of HTLV have been described (HTLV-1 to -4) with three of them having closely related simian virus analogues named STLV-1, 2 and 3. In this study, our aim was to search for a simian HTLV-4-related virus and to document and characterize further the diversity of STLV infections in wild primate populations. We screened 1297 whole blood samples from 13 different primate species from southern Cameroon. Overall, 93 samples gave HTLV-1, HTLV-2 or dual HTLV-1/-2 INNOLIA profiles, 12 were HTLV positive but untypeable and 14 were indeterminate. Subsequently, we performed generic and specific (STLV-1 to -3) tax-rex PCRs to discriminate the different PTLV types, completed with phylogenetic analysis of 450-bp LTR sequences for STLV-1 and 900 bp pX-LTR sequences for STLV-3. We show for the first time that Lophocebus albigena and Cercopithecus cephus carry both STLV-1 and a divergent STLV-3. We also identified a new STLV-1 lineage in one C. cephus. Finally, we identify relative divergence levels in the tax/rex phylogeny suggesting that additional types of PTLV should be defined, particularly for the highly divergent STLV-1(MarB43) strain that we provisionally name STLV-5.

A preliminary model of human-animal relationships in the zoo,"['Hosey, G']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2007.04.013,FEB 2008,30,"The concept of the human-animal relationship (HAR) is widely used in farm animal research to describe the outcome of the different qualities and quantities of interaction between stockpersons and the animals in their care. Thus, negative, positive or neutral HARs may result from the effect of mostly negative (e.g. rough handling), neutral (e.g. no handling) or positive (e.g. gentle handling) interactions. In this paper the concept is applied to zoo animals in an attempt to provide a model not only of HARs between zoo animals and keepers, but also between zoo animals and unfamiliar people, primarily the visiting public. Behavioural responses of animals to zoo visitors are inconsistent both within and between taxa, and the history of interactions the individual animal has experienced, and hence the HARs it has developed, may be one of the variables that leads to this inconsistency. The model starts, like the farm animal models, with the animals' fear of humans, which is itself dependent upon species. The subsequent history of interactions the animal experiences, both with familiar and unfamiliar people, then determines the animal's HAR, which in turn influences the way the animal responds to people. There are currently insufficient data to test the model, but predictions of the model are identified here which could be used to test it. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
The development of feeding behaviour in wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Nowell, AA', 'Fletcher, AW']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/156853907783244747,FEB 2008,7,"Before being weaned, young primates must learn which plant species are suitable to eat, and how to process and combine them to meet their nutritional needs. This study provides a detailed investigation of the development of feeding behaviour in a wild population of western lowland gorillas observed in a bai habitat. The behaviour of 56 known immature individuals aged between 0 and 8 years was recorded at Mbeli Bai, Republic of Congo, using focal, scan and all-occurrence sampling over a period of 16 months. Results indicated that independent feeding skills were acquired by the end of infancy and did not undergo significant change beyond this point. However, suckling continued into the juvenile period, suggesting that some continued investment by the mother was necessary until the strength and skills of immatures developed, perhaps to enable self-sufficiency through periods of succulent fruit (assumed to be the most suitable weaning food) scarcity. This was supported by observations of an increase in feeding-related behaviour with age, particularly during infancy. Additionally, age-related differences in the species and plant parts selected by different age classes, as well as in levels of food processing, were apparent. Play feeding, suggested to be a precursor to independent feeding, was most prevalent in infancy, decreasing as feeding skills developed. Thus, it would appear, given that food transfer also occurs (Nowell & Fletcher, 2006), that feeding skills in western lowland gorillas are learned by a combination of exposure to and manipulation of food items, and probably also through the observation of conspecifics. Observations in a forest habitat are needed to improve our understanding of feeding development in this subspecies."
Ape metaphysics: Object individuation without language,"['Mendes, N', 'Rakoczy, H', 'Call, J']",COGNITION,10.1016/j.cognition.2007.04.007,FEB 2008,21,"Developmental research suggests that whereas very young infants individuate objects purely on spatiotemporal grounds, from (at latest) around 1 year of age children are capable of individuating objects according to the kind they belong to and the properties they instantiate. As the latter ability has been found to correlate with language, some have speculated whether it might be essentially language dependent and therefore uniquely human. Existing studies with non-human primates seem to speak against this hypothesis, but fail to present conclusive evidence due to methodological shortcomings. In the present experiments we set out to test non-linguistic object individuation in three great ape species with a refined manual search methodology. Experiment 1 tested for spatiotemporal object individuation: Subjects saw 1 or 2 objects simultaneously being placed inside a box in which they could reach, and then in both conditions only found 1 object. After retrieval of the 1 object, subjects reached again significantly more often when they had seen 2 than when they had seen 1 object. Experiment 2 tested for object individuation according to property/kind information only: Subjects saw 1 object being placed inside the box, and then either found that object (expected) or an object of a different kind (unexpected). Analogously to Experiment 1, after retrieval of the 1 object, subjects reached again significantly more often in the unexpected than in the expected condition. These results thus confirm previous findings suggesting that individuating objects according to their property/kind is neither uniquely human nor essentially language dependent. It remains to be seen, however, whether this kind of object individuation requires sortal concepts as human linguistic thinkers use them, or whether some simpler form of tracking properties is sufficient.

Three-dimensional primate molar enamel thickness,"['Olejniczak, AJ', 'Tafforeau, P', 'Feeney, RNM', 'Martin, LB']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.09.014,FEB 2008,45,"Molar enamel thickness has played an important role in the taxonomic, phylogenetic, and dietary assessments of fossil primate teeth for nearly 90 years. Despite the frequency with which enamel thickness is discussed in paleoanthropological discourse, methods used to attain information about enamel thickness are destructive and record information from only a single plane of section. Such semidestructive planar methods limit sample sizes and ignore dimensional data that may be culled from the entire length of a tooth. In light of recently developed techniques to investigate enamel thickness in 3D and the frequent use of enamel thickness in dietary and phylogenetic interpretations of living and fossil primates, the study presented here aims to produce and make available to other researchers a database of 3D enamel thickness measurements of primate molars (it = 182 molars). The 3D enamel thickness measurements reported here generally agree with 2D studies. Hominoids show a broad range of relative enamel thicknesses, and cercopithecoids have relatively thicker enamel than ceboids, which in turn have relatively thicker enamel than strepsirrhine primates, on average. Past studies performed using 2D sections appear to have accurately diagnosed the 3D relative enamel thickness condition in great apes and humans: Gorilla has the relatively thinnest enamel, Pan has relatively thinner enamel than Pongo, and Homo has the relatively thickest enamel. Although the data set presented here has some taxonomic gaps, it may serve as a useful reference for researchers investigating enamel thickness in fossil taxa and studies of primate gnathic biology.

Comparative observations on the tooth root morphology of Gigantopithecus blacki,"['Kupczik, K', 'Dean, MC']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.09.013,FEB 2008,34,"The extinct great ape Gigantopithecus blacki from the middle Pleistocene of China and Vietnam is known only from dental and mandibular remains, and its dietary specializations remain contentious. Here, for the first time, we describe the root morphology in G. blacki using computed tomography and three-dimensional image processing. We quantify the tooth root lengths and surface areas of the female G. blacki mandible No. I from the Liucheng Cave and compare it to a sample of extant great apes and humans, as well as the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and the American black bear (Ursus americanus). The results show that, in G. blacki, the pattern of mandibular root numbers-particularly that of the premolars-corresponds with that of Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Pongo pygmaeus. However, G. blacki can be distinguished from the extant hominids by having relatively higher values for postcanine root length and surface area, both absolutely and relative to mandibular size (except for premolar root lengths of humans). The relatively large postcanine root surface areas, which are most similar to A. melanoleuca, suggest that the dentition of G. blacki was adapted to sustaining relatively large occlusal forces needed to fracture mechanically resistant foods such as bamboo.

Preliminary observations on increasing root length during the eruptive phase of tooth development in modern humans and great apes,"['Dean, MC', 'Vesey, P']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.09.021,FEB 2008,24,"Ground sections of incisors, canines, and molars were selected that showed clear incremental markings in root dentine. The sample comprised 98 Homo sapiens, 53 Pan troglodytes, and a more limited combined sample of 51 Gorilla and Pongo sections. Daily rates of root dentine formation, together with the orientation of incremental markings in roots close to the cement-dentine junction (CDJ), were used to calculate root extension rates for the first 10 mm of root formed beyond the buccal enamel cervix. Modern human anterior tooth roots showed a more regular pattern of increase in root length than those in great apes. In Pan, root growth rose quickly to higher rates but then flattened off. The fastest extension rates in modem humans were in incisor roots (10-12 mu m per day), followed by canines (8-9 mu m per day). Extension rates in Pan rose to slightly greater values in canines (similar to 12-14 mu m per day) than in incisors (similar to 10-11 mu m per day). Molar tooth roots in both modem humans and great apes grew in a nonlinear manner. Peak rates in molars reduced from M1 to M3 (8, 7, and 6 mu m per day, respectively). Like humans, root growth in Pan peaked earlier in M1s at rates of between 8 and 9 pm per day, and later in M3s at rates of 7 to 8 mu m per day. The more limited data set for Gorilla and Pongo molars suggests that extension rates were generally higher than in Pan by approximately 1.0-1.5 mu m per day. There were greater differences in peak extension rates, with Gorilla and Pongo extension rates being between 2.5 and 4.5 mu m per day higher than those in Pan. These findings highlight for the first time that root growth rates differ between tooth types in both pattern and rate and between taxa. They provide the basis with which to explore further the potential comparative relationships between root growth, jaw growth, and the eruption process. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Gastroesophageal reflux disease in baboons (Papio sp.): a new animal model,"['Glover, EJ', 'Leland, MM', 'Dick, EJ', 'Hubbard, GB']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1111/j.1600-0684.2007.00217.x,FEB 2008,12,"Background Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is increasingly prevalent in the human population. Current animal models require surgical or other manipulation to produce symptoms. An animal model that exhibits spontaneous GERD would provide the opportunity for much-needed research examining the susceptibility, diagnosis, and treatment of GERD.

Methods Eight baboons (Papio hamadryas sp.) were diagnosed with GERD histopathologically using biopsies or postmortem tissues.

Results The disease was characterized by a spectrum of symptoms comparable with that found in the human population. Some subjects had no gross signs of clinical disease, but were diagnosed by histopathological examination. Almost all subjects presented with at least one clinical sign of the disease. Regurgitation was the most common.

Conclusions The baboon may be a superior animal model for GERD research because it is a naturally occurring model and is anatomically and physiologically similar to humans."

FISH data indicated that the HERV-W probe (fosWE1) derived from the gorilla fosmid library was clearly detected in all chromosomes except for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, and Y. Most of the HERV-W family seems to be proliferated during the course of primate radiation approximately 2545 Myr ago. The sequences of target site duplication (TSD) for the proliferation of HERV-W family were completely different in full length or processed pseudo HERV-W sequences, respectively. The HERV-W LTR elements, having biological roles of alternative promoter, exonization, alternative polyadenylation, were detected in several loci, and those elements are actively expressed in various tissues. Taken together, these data are valuable sources for understanding the biological roles of HERV-W family in humans."
"Nutritional quality of gorilla diets: consequences of age, sex, and season","['Rothman, JM', 'Dierenfeld, ES', 'Hintz, HF', 'Pell, AN']",OECOLOGIA,10.1007/s00442-007-0901-1,FEB 2008,45,"We tested the effects of age, sex, and season on the nutritional strategies of a group of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. Through observations of food intake of individual gorillas and nutritional analyses of dietary components over different seasons and environments, we estimated nutrient intake and evaluated diet adequacy. Our results suggest that the nutritional costs of reproduction and growth affect nutrient intake; growing juveniles and adult females ate more food and more protein per kilogram of metabolic body mass than did silverbacks. The diets of silverback males, adult females, and juveniles contained similar concentrations of protein, fiber, and sugar, indicating that adult females and juveniles did not select higher protein foods than silverbacks but rather consumed more dry matter to ingest more protein. Juveniles consumed more minerals (Ca, P, Mg, K, Fe, Zn, Mn, Mo) per kilogram of body mass than adult females and silverback males, and juveniles consumed diets with higher concentrations of phosphorous, iron, and zinc, indicating that the foods they ate contained higher concentrations of these minerals. Seasonally, the amount of food consumed on a dry weight basis did not vary, but with increased frugivory, dietary concentrations of protein and fiber decreased and those of water-soluble carbohydrates increased. Energy intake did not change over the year. With the exception of sodium, gorillas ate diets that exceeded human nutrient requirements. A better understanding of the relative importance of food quantity and quality for different age-sex classes provides insights into the ways in which gorillas may be limited by food resources when faced with environmental heterogeneity."
The mastodon mitochondrial genome: a mammoth accomplishment,"['Roca, AL']",TRENDS IN GENETICS,10.1016/j.tig.2007.11.005,FEB 2008,10,"The mitochondrial genome of an American mastodon was recently sequenced and used to root a phylogenetic analysis that included full mitochondrial genome sequences from woolly mammoths and the two living elephant genera. The study definitively established that mammoth and Asian elephant mitochondrial DNA lineages are more closely related than either is to African elephants.

Gorillas are a host for Dientamoeba fragilis: An update on the life cycle and host distribution,"['Stark, D', 'Phillips, O', 'Peckett, D', 'Munro, U', 'Marriott, D', 'Harkness, J', 'Ellis, J']",VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/j.vetpar.2007.10.002,JAN 25 2008,16,"Dientamoeba fragilis is a gastrointestinal protozoan that has a worldwide distribution and is emergeing as a common cause of diarrhea. As D. fragilis has a propensity to cause chronic illness with symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) it is not surprising that some patients with D. fragilis are misdiagnosed as having IBS. In contrast to most other pathogenic protozoa very little is known about its life cycle, epidemiology and mode of transmission. What role animal reservoirs play in the transmission of this parasite is unknown. Consequently we undertook a prospective study to determine the host distribution of D. fragilis. Over a 2-year-period, 608 faecal samples from a wide range of animal and bird species, including pigs and other food species, were screened using permanent stained smears for the presence of D. fragilis. Trophozoites of D. fragilis were only detected in Western lowland gorillas (3/10) (Gorilla g. gorilla) and confirmed by PCR targeting the SSU rRNA gene. The limited host range detected suggests human infection may not involve transmission from other animal species. In addition, we provide an update on the limited knowledge about the life cycle of this parasite and its host distribution. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Molecular evolution of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A gene in primates,"['Uddin, M', 'Opazo, JC', 'Wildman, DE', 'Sherwood, CC', 'Hof, PR', 'Goodman, M', 'Grossman, LI']",BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1186/1471-2148-8-8,JAN 15 2008,24,"Background: Many electron transport chain (ETC) genes show accelerated rates of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions in anthropoid primate lineages, yet in non-anthropoid lineages the ETC proteins are typically highly conserved. Here, we test the hypothesis that COX5A, the ETC gene that encodes cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A, shows a pattern of anthropoid-specific adaptive evolution, and investigate the distribution of this protein in catarrhine brains.

Results: In a dataset comprising 29 vertebrate taxa, including representatives from all major groups of primates, there is nearly 100% conservation of the COX5A amino acid sequence among extant, non-anthropoid placental mammals. The most recent common ancestor of these species lived about 100 million years ( MY) ago. In contrast, anthropoid primates show markedly elevated rates of nonsynonymous evolution. In particular, branch site tests identify five positively selected codons in anthropoids, and ancestral reconstructions infer that substitutions in these codons occurred predominantly on stem lineages (anthropoid, ape and New World monkey) and on the human terminal branch. Examination of catarrhine brain samples by immunohistochemistry characterizes for the first time COX5A protein distribution in the primate neocortex, and suggests that the protein is most abundant in the mitochondria of large-size projection neurons. Real time quantitative PCR supports previous microarray results showing COX5A is expressed in cerebral cortical tissue at a higher level in human than in chimpanzee or gorilla.

Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest that both protein structural and gene regulatory changes contributed to COX5A evolution during humankind's ancestry. Furthermore, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that adaptations in ETC genes contributed to the emergence of the energetically expensive anthropoid neocortex."
"Knuckle walking signal in the manual digits of Pan and Gorilla
","['Matarazzo, S']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20701,JAN 2008,8,"This article examines the curvature of the manual proximal and middle phalanges of species belonging to Pan, Gorilla, Ateles, Macaca, Pongo, Hylobates, and Cebus to determine whether middle phalangeal curvature, when considered in conjunction with proximal phalangeal curvature, yields a locomotor signal. Prior studies have demonstrated the discriminatory power of proximal phalanges for separating suspensory species (including knuckle walkers) from pronograde quadrupedal species, but less emphasis has been placed on the distinguishing phalangeal characteristics of taxa within the suspensory category. This study demonstrates, first, that middle phalanges discriminate suspensory from nonsuspensory species, although not as cleanly as proximal phalanges. Finer discrimination of locomotor signals, including subtle differences among animals employing through a comparison of the curvatures of the proximal phalanges and corresponding middle phalanges. Their relative curvature differs in quadrupeds, brachiators, and knuckle walkers. Knuckle walkers (Pan and Gorilla) have relatively little curvature of the middle phalanges coupled with marked curvature of the proximal phalanges, whereas brachiators (Ateles and Hylobates) display marked curvature of both proximal and middle phalanges, and pronograde quadrupeds (Cebus and Macaca) have relatively straight proximal and moderately curved middle phalanges. Quadrumanous climbers (Pongo) have a unique combination of traits, whereby curvature is high in both proximal and middle phalanges, but less so in the latter than the former. These differences, predictable on the basis of the biomechanical forces to which digits are subjected, may open a new venue for future research on the locomotor repertoire of prebipedal ancestors of hominins."
New insights in insect prey choice by chimpanzees and gorillas in southeast Cameroon: The role of nutritional value,"['Deblauwe, I', 'Janssens, GPJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20703,JAN 2008,42,"The insect diet of chimpanzees and gorillas living at the northern periphery of the Dja Biosphere Reserve in southeast Cameroon and its nutritional contribution is described. We analyzed fecal samples and recorded additional evidence of insectivory. A detailed prey species list is presented for both apes. We carried out nutritional analyses (macronutrients, macro- and micro-minerals) on 11 important and eight nonimportant, but. accessible, ant and termite prey species, and estimated the average nutrient intake/day through insects. Although gorillas ate insects more frequently, the average prey biomass intake/day by chimpanzees was twice that by gorillas. The lack of tool-use by gorillas cannot be the main reason for the small overlap of important prey species. Both apes did not seem to consume ant prey for one or more specific nutrients. Also other factors, such as medicinal use, should be considered. Termites, on the other hand, seemed to be selected for particular nutrients. Gorilla intake of the important termite prey, Cubitermes and Thoracotermes, met with estimated iron requirements. Their potential role as antidiarrheal treatment is as yet unclear. Chimpanzee intake of the important termite prey, Macrotermes spp., met with estimated manganese requirements and the protein intake/day (mean: 2 g/d) reached significant values (> 20 g/d). To fully understand the importance of nutritional contributions of insects to ape diets in Cameroon, the chemical composition and nutrient intake of fruit and foliage in their diets should be investigated."

Its adoptability and usefulness for animal studies are tested exemplarily on a sample of 20 zoo-housed great apes (five of each of the following species): bonobos, Pan paniscus; chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus; gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla; and orang-utans, Pongo pygmaeus abelii. Data on 76 single trait-relevant behaviours were recorded in a series of 14 laboratory-based situations and in two different group situations. Data collection was repeated completely after a break of 2 weeks within a 50-day period. All behaviour records were sufficiently reliable. Individual- and variable-oriented analyses showed high/substantial temporal stability on different levels of aggregation. Distinctive and stable individual situational and response profiles clarified the importance of situations and of multiple trait-relevant behaviours. The present study calls for a closer collaboration between behavioural biologists and personality psychologists to tap the full potential of animal personality research.

Behavioral cues that great apes use to forage for hidden food,"['Buttelmann, D', 'Call, J', 'Tomasello, M']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-007-0095-2,JAN 2008,5,"We conducted three studies to examine whether the four great ape species (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) are able to use behavioral experimenter-given cues in an object-choice task. In the subsequent experimental conditions subjects were presented with two eggs, one of which contained food and the other did not. In Study 1 the experimenter examined both eggs by smelling or shaking them, but only made a failed attempt to open (via biting) the egg containing food. In a control condition, the experimenter examined and attempted to open both eggs, but in reverse order to control for stimulus enhancement. The apes significantly preferred the egg that was first examined and then bitten, but had no preference in a baseline condition in which there were no cues. In Study 2, we investigated whether the apes could extend this ability to cues not observed in apes so far (i.e., attempting to pull apart the egg), as well as whether they made this discrimination based on the function of the action the experimenter performed. Subjects significantly preferred eggs presented with this novel cue, but did not prefer eggs presented with a novel but functionally irrelevant action. In Study 3, apes did not interpret human actions as cues to food-location when they already knew that the eggs were empty. Thus, great apes were able to use a variety of experimenter-given cues associated with foraging actions to locate hidden food and thereby were partially sensitive to the general purpose underlying these actions."
Between-groups within-gene heterogeneity of residual variances in microarray gene expression data,"['Casellas, J', 'Varona, L']",BMC GENOMICS,10.1186/1471-2164-9-319,JUL 4 2008,3,"Background: The analysis of microarray gene expression data typically tries to identify differential gene expression patterns in terms of differences of the mathematical expectation between groups of arrays (e.g. treatments or biological conditions). Nevertheless, the differential expression pattern could also be characterized by group-specific dispersion patterns, although little is known about this phenomenon in microarray data. Commonly, a homogeneous gene-specific residual variance is assumed in hierarchical mixed models for gene expression data, although it could result in substantial biases if this assumption is not true.

Results: In this manuscript, a hierarchical mixed model with within-gene heterogeneous residual variances is proposed to analyze gene expression data from non-competitive hybridized microarrays. Moreover, a straightforward Bayes factor is adapted to easily check within-gene (between groups) heterogeneity of residual variances when samples are grouped in two different treatments. This Bayes factor only requires the analysis of the complex model (hierarchical mixed model with between-groups heterogeneous residual variances for all analyzed genes) and gene-specific Bayes factors are provided from the output of a simple Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.

Conclusion: This statistical development opens new research possibilities within the gene expression framework, where heterogeneity in residual variability could be viewed as an alternative and plausible characterization of differential expression patterns."
Reactivity of urinary albumin (microalbumin) assays with fragmented or modified albumin,"['Sviridov, D', 'Drake, SK', 'Hortin, GL']",CLINICAL CHEMISTRY,10.1373/clinchem.2007.092825,JAN 2008,26,"BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding occurrence and measurement of structural variants of albumin in urine. In this study, we examined cross -reactivity of in vitro modified albumins in assays for urine albumin (microalbumin).

METHODS: We analyzed albumin modified by reagents, trypsin, or physical treatments or differing in primary sequence (animal albumins) with an immunoturbidimetric assay (Beckman LX20) using goat antiserum and a competitive immunoassay (Siemens Immulite) using a monoclonal antibody. We assessed occurrence of albumin fragments in urine by use of Western blotting of 24 specimens.

RESULTS: Chemical modification, modest sequence substitution (gorilla albumin), or cleavage of albumin by cyanogen bromide (CNBr) had little effect on reactivity in the LX20 assay. Albumin extensively cleaved with trypsin retained partial reactivity. The Immulite assay generally was affected more severely by albumin modifications and sequence changes. Western blots of fresh urine specimens or specimens stored at -80 degrees C showed little albumin fragmentation, but some specimens stored for 3 years at -20 degrees C had extensively fragmented albumin that was detected by the LX20 but not the Immulite assay.

CONCLUSIONS: Nearly equivalent reactivity of intact albumin and CNBr fragments in the immunoturbidimetric assay indicates reactivity of antibodies with multiple epitopes throughout albumin. Therefore, it is difficult to abolish reactivity of albumin in this type of urine albumin assay. Differential sensitivity of 2 assays to albumin modification identifies a potential source of assay nonequivalence in measuring urinary albumin, particularly for specimens stored at -20 degrees C.

Fatty acid composition of wild anthropoid primate milks,"['Milligan, LA', 'Rapoport, SI', 'Cranfield, MR', 'Dittus, W', 'Glander, KE', 'Oftedal, OT', 'Power, ML', 'Whittier, CA', 'Bazinet, RP']",COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cbpb.2007.08.006,JAN 2008,16,"Fatty acids in milk reflect the interplay between species-specific physiological mechanisms and maternal diet. Anthropoid primates (apes, Old and New World monkeys) vary in patterns of growth and development and dietary strategies. Milk fatty acid profiles also are predicted to vary widely. This study investigates milk fatty acid composition of five wild anthropoids (Alouatta palliata, Callithrix jacchus, Gorilla beringei beringei, Leontopithecus rosalia, Macaca sinica) to test the null hypothesis of a generalized anthropoid milk fatty acid composition. Milk from New and Old World monkeys had significantly more 8:0 and 10:0 than milk from apes. The leaf eating species G. b. beringei and A. paliatta had a significantly higher proportion of milk 18:3n-3, a fatty acid found primarily in plant lipids. Mean percent composition of 22:6n-3 was significantly different among monkeys and apes, but was similar to the lowest reported values for human milk. Mountain gorillas were unique among anthropoids in the high proportion of milk 20:4n-6. This seems to be unrelated to requirements of a larger brain and may instead reflect species-specific metabolic processes or an unknown source of this fatty acid in the mountain gorilla diet.

Evaluating orangutan census techniques using nest decay rates: Implications for population estimates,"['Mathewson, PD', 'Spehar, SN', 'Meijaard, E', 'Nardiyono', 'Purnomo', 'Sasmirul, A', 'Sudiyanto', 'Oman', 'Sulhnudin', 'Jasary', 'Jumali', 'Marshall, AJ']",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,10.1890/07-0385.1,JAN 2008,22,"An accurate estimate for orangutan nest decay time is a crucial factor in commonly used methods for estimating orangutan population size. Decay rates are known to vary, but the decay process and, thus, the temporal and spatial variation in decay time are poorly understood. We used established line-transect methodology to survey orangutan nests in a lowland forest in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, and monitored the decay of 663 nests over 20 months. Using Markov chain analysis we calculated a decay time of 602 days, which is significantly longer than times found in other studies. Based on this, we recalculated the orangutan density estimate for a site in East Kalimantan; the resulting density is much lower than previous estimates (previous estimates were 3-8 times higher than our recalculated density). Our data suggest that short-term studies where decay times are determined using matrix mathematics may produce unreliable decay times. Our findings have implications for other parts of the orangutan range where population estimates are based on potentially unreliable nest decay rate estimates, and we recommend that for various parts of the orangutan range census estimates be reexamined. Considering the high variation in decay rates there is a need to move away from using single-number decay time estimates and, preferably, to test methods that do not rely on nest decay times as alternatives for rapid assessments of orangutan habitat for conservation in Borneo."
Canine reconciliation and third-party-initiated postconflict affiliation: Do peacemaking social mechanisms in dogs rival those of higher primates?,"['Cools, AKA', 'Van Hout, AJM', 'Nelissen, MHJ']",ETHOLOGY,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2007.01443.x,JAN 2008,58,"Conflicts over food, access to mates, or other limited resources can sometimes escalate into aggression. In species that form social groups, these aggressive conflicts can jeopardize the benefits of group living, such as enhanced access to valued resources, necessitating the development of behavioural mechanisms that either mitigate conflicts, prevent aggressive escalation or resolve disputes. Two important mechanisms for managing the effects of disputes involve postconflict (PC) affiliative behaviour, either between the former opponents (called 'reconciliation') or between one opponent and a third party. Even though numerous studies have tested reconciliatory and third-party affiliation tendencies in primates, for non-primate animals little systematic data are available. We performed behavioural observations on three groups of captive domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and used a PC/MC method to test the existence of reconciliation and third-party affiliation in this species. The results of this study clearly indicate that both reconciliation and third-party PC interactions are present in the domestic dog, and form important social mechanisms of the domestic dog. Furthermore, familiar individuals showed a significantly higher proportion of reconciled conflicts than did unfamiliar individuals, and also displayed fewer conflicts. Finally, we show that most of the third-party affiliations involve the victim of a conflict and that victim-directed affiliation outweighs victim-initiated third-party affiliation in these PC interactions."

We carried out two annual censuses of western lowland gorilla ( e. g. gorilla) and chimpanzee populations (Pan t. troglodytes) in an active logging concession in Southeast Cameroon. The results suggest that gorillas may adapt their range use to avoid most recently logged compartments, while chimpanzees appear to be more spatially resilient to logging. In our study site, selective logging affected 10% of the forest. After logging, gorillas nested in all types of vegetation, while chimpanzees nested exclusively in mixed mature forest. Fruit availability was not affected by logging and did not explain the distribution of ape nests in the study area."

Hominoid chromosomal rearrangements on 17q map to complex regions of segmental duplication,"['Cardone, MF', 'Jiang, ZS', ""D'Addabbo, P"", 'Archidiacono, N', 'Rocchi, M', 'Eichler, EE', 'Ventura, M']",GENOME BIOLOGY,10.1186/gb-2008-9-2-r28,2008,15,"Background: Chromosomal rearrangements, such as translocations and inversions, are recurrent phenomena during evolution, and both of them are involved in reproductive isolation and speciation. To better understand the molecular basis of chromosome rearrangements and their part in karyotype evolution, we have investigated the history of human chromosome 17 by comparative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and sequence analysis.

Results: Human bacterial artificial chromosome/pI artificial chromosome probes spanning the length of chromosome 17 were used in FISH experiments on great apes, Old World monkeys and New World monkeys to study the evolutionary history of this chromosome. We observed that the macaque marker order represents the ancestral organization. Human, chimpanzee and gorilla homologous chromosomes differ by a paracentric inversion that occurred specifically in the Homo sapiens/Pan troglodytes/Gorilla gorilla ancestor. Detailed analyses of the paracentric inversion revealed that the breakpoints mapped to two regions syntenic to human 17q12/21 and 17q23, both rich in segmental duplications.

Conclusion: Sequence analyses of the human and macaque organization suggest that the duplication events occurred in the catarrhine ancestor with the duplication blocks continuing to duplicate or undergo gene conversion during evolution of the hominoid lineage. We propose that the presence of these duplicons has mediated the inversion in the H. sapiens/P. troglodytes/G. gorilla ancestor. Recently, the same duplication blocks have been shown to be polymorphic in the human population and to be involved in triggering microdeletion and duplication in human. These results further support a model where genomic architecture has a direct role in both rearrangement involved in karyotype evolution and genomic instability in human."
Enthesis bilateral asymmetry in humans and African apes,"['Drapeau, MSM']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jchb.2007.12.004,2008,10,"Entheses (skeletal muscle and tendon attachment sites) have often been used to infer handedness and activity variability among human populations. However, the specific roles that intensity vs. frequency of muscle contractions play in modifying entheses are not well understood and the assumption that entheses reflect muscle activity levels has been challenged. This study explores the effect of habitual muscular activity on enthesis morphology in humans and African apes by investigating bilateral asymmetry in the forelimbs and hindlimbs of these taxa. Humans have generally more developed entheses in the lower limb while African apes have generally more developed entheses in the forelimbs. All species studied have more asymmetric forelimbs than hindlimbs except humans that show more asymmetrical expression of bony spurs in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. When comparing species, humans are always more asymmetric in ethesis development than apes for both the forelimbs and hindlimbs, which reflects the relatively greater asymmetry in limb use in humans and the more symmetric use in apes. Enthesis development may reflect cross-symmetry patterns in humans and, more subtly, a moderate handedness in apes during manipulative activities. This study suggests that enthesis morphology provides information on muscle activity levels, with greater development of entheses associated with more habitual or powerful muscle use. The general similarity of ape and human responses to muscle activity suggests that muscle activity influenced enthesis development in Plio-Pleistocene hominins and that interpretation of muscle markings in these fossils can provide data for functional inferences in these extinct species.

Raymond Dart as a pioneering primatologist,"['Strkalj, G', 'Tobias, PV', 'TAUNG']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jchb.2008.06.002,2008,1,"Raymond Dart is best known today for his groundbreaking research in palaeoanthropology. It is often forgotten, howeve, that Dart was a scientist of many interests, who made significant contributions to various disciplines. One of these is the study o living non-human primates. Dart became aware of the importance of primate studies and their relevance for research in other disciplines early in his career. In the late 1920s Dart established a colony of captive baboons in the Anatomy Department, University of the Witwatersrand. Johannesburg. On these animals, members of his Department, most notably Joseph Gillman and Christine Gilber, carried out a number of significant behavioural and endocrinological researches. In 1930, as a member of an Italian Scientific Expedition, Dart was involved in hunting a mountain gorilla (for research purposes). He was also active in primate field studies. In 1957 he and Phillip Tobias founded a Witwatersrand University Uganda Gorilla Research Unit for the study of the Virunga mountain gorillas. The unit produced pioneering studies, conducted by Jill Donisthorpe, on the behaviour of these primates in their natural habitat. At the same time Dart was actively engaged in Conservation of the mountain gorillas. He also studied South African chaema boboons in the wild. In the field of primate studies Raymond Dart figures prominently as a pioneering catalyst as well as researcher and conservationist. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."
"Prevalence and genetic diversity of simian immunodeficiency virus infection in wild-living red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus badius badius) From the Tai forest, Cote d'Ivoire SIV wrc in wild-living western red colobus monkeys","['Locatelli, S', 'Liegeois, F', 'Lafay, B', 'Roeder, AD', 'Bruford, MW', 'Formenty, P', 'Noe, R', 'Delaporte, E', 'Peeters, M']",INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.meegid.2007.08.004,JAN 2008,17,"Numerous African primates are infected with simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). It is now well established that the clade of SIVs infecting west-central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) represent the progenitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), whereas HIV-2 results from different cross-species transmissions of SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys).

We present here the first molecular epidemiological survey of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVwrc) in wild-living western red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus badius badius) which are frequently hunted by the human population and represent a favourite prey of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). We collected faecal samples (n = 88) and we assessed individual discrimination by microsatellite analyses and visual observation. We tested the inferred 53 adult individuals belonging to two neighbouring habituated groups for presence of SIVwrc infection by viral RNA (vRNA) detection. We amplified viral polymerase (pol) (650 bp) and/or envelope (env) (570 bp) sequences in 14 individuals, resulting in a minimal prevalence of 26% among the individuals sampled, possibly reaching 50% when considering the relatively low sensitivity of viral RNA detection in faecal samples. With a few exceptions, phylogenetic analysis of pol and env sequences revealed a low degree of intragroup genetic diversity and a general viral clustering related to the social group of origin. However, we found a higher intergroup diversity. Behavioural and demographic data collected previously from these communities indicate that red colobus monkeys live in promiscuous multi-male societies, where females leave their natal group at the sub-adult stage of their lives and where extra-group copulations or male immigration have been rarely observed. The phylogenetic data we obtained seem to reflect these behavioural characteristics. Overall, our results indicate that wild-living red colobus represent a substantial reservoir of SIVwrc. Moreover, because of their frequent association with other monkey species, the predation pressure exerted by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and by poachers around and inside the park, simian to simian and simian to human SlVwrc cross-species transmission cannot be excluded.

Perimenopause and menopause: documenting life changes in aging female gorillas.,"['Atsalis, Sylvia', 'Margulis, Susan W']",Interdisciplinary topics in gerontology,10.1159/000137704,2008,12,"As our closest living relatives, great apes likely experience physiological patterns associated with reproductive aging that are similar to humans. We present results from a nationwide zoo-based study on female western lowland gorillas during which we evaluated concentrations of progestogens via daily fecal sampling in 30 gorillas, 22 of whom were geriatric (>or=30). Whereas control females cycled regularly, ca. 23% of geriatric females were acyclic (menopausal), and approximately 1/3 showed variable hormonal patterns suggestive of perimenopause. Patterns included increased cycle variability, low luteal phase rises of progestogens - possibly indicative of anovulatory cycling - and peak height variability of progestogens in the luteal phase of the cycle. We discovered a progressive trend toward increased variability in estrous cycle length and toward decreased concentrations of fecal progestogens when we compared control to geriatric cycling and to geriatric noncycling females. Noncycling females had significantly lower overall progestogen concentrations than the cycling females, though differences were not significant when cycle phase was incorporated. Preliminary analyses of follow-up data on 10 perimenopausal females indicated that subjects experienced age-related changes in reproductive function that mirrored those observed in aging human females including a female who transitioned from perimenopause to menopause. To date, maximum longevity in captive female gorillas is 52 years, with poor reproductive prognosis beginning from the age of 37 suggesting a postreproductive lifespan of >25%. Continued study of aging apes is warranted, with emphasis on longitudinal monitoring of aged subjects."
The evolution of handedness in humans and great apes: a review and current issues,"['Cashmore, L', 'Uomini, N', 'Chapelain, A']",JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES,NA,2008,64,"Population-level right-handedness is a defining characteristic of humans. Despite extensive research, we still do not know the conditions or timing of its emergence in human evolution. We present a review of research into the origins of handedness, based on fossil and archaeological data for hand preference and great ape hand-use. The data show that skeletal asymmetries in arm and hand hones supporting a right-sided dominance were present at least in the genus Homo, although data are more robust for Neanderthals, The evidence from tool-use, production, and cave art confirms that right-hand preference was established in Neanderthals and was maintained until the present. The great apes can provide real-life models for testing the conditions that facilitate or enhance hand preference at both the individual and group levels. The database on great ape hand-use indicates that they do exhibit hand preferences, especially in complex tasks. However, their preferences vary between tasks, and while group-level biases have occasionally been reported, no human-like handedness bias has been found. We discuss the methodological problems encountered in these approaches. Shared problems include a lack of agreed terminology both within and between disciplines, small sample sizes, interpretation biases and a failure to replicate experiments. In general, there is a paucity of fossil material with poor preservation hampering traditional metric methods. The archaeological data are often founded on unreliable methods. The primate database is plagued by the use of measures that could be inappropriate for revealing hand preference, and by methodological inconsistencies between studies. We emphasise the need to standardise the methods to allow between studies and species comparisons. We propose that when referring to 'handedness' it is more appropriate to use the terms 'hand preference' and 'hand use', to avoid confusion with each disciplined own definition of handedness."
Task constraints mask great apes' ability to solve the trap-table task,"['Girndt, A', 'Meier, T', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-ANIMAL BEHAVIOR PROCESSES,10.1037/0097-7403.34.1.54,JAN 2008,23,"Researchers have investigated animals' causal knowledge with a task requiring subjects to use a tool to bring a reward within reach whilst avoiding a trap. Previous studies have suggested limitations in the ability of several species to avoid traps in tubes or tables. However, certain features may have inflated task difficulty. We tested 20 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), 7 orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), 5 bonobos (Pan paniscus), and 5 gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) in the trap-table-a task in which subjects have to pull one of two rakes prepositioned behind two rewards on a flat surface. One of the rewards is in front of a trap into which it will fall. We investigated the effect of trap type, tool type, the number of available tools, and reinforcement regime on performance. We replicated previous findings showing that apes failed to choose the correct rake above chance. However, when they could instead choose where to insert a single tool, around 80% of the apes solved the trap-table task in the first trial, revealing an important effect of task constraints on their performance."
Fertility and mortality patterns of captive Bornean and Sumatran orangutans: Is there a species difference in life history?,"['Anderson, HB', 'Thompson, ME', 'Knott, CD', 'Perlins, L']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.05.014,JAN 2008,14,"Across broad taxonomic groups, life history models predict that increased ecological predictability will lead to conservative investment in reproductive effort. Within species, however, organisms are predicted to have increased reproductive rates under improved environmental conditions. It is not clear how these models apply to closely-related species. In this paper, we examine predictions from these models as applied to variability in reproductive rates between the two species of orangutans, Pongo pygmaeus (Bornean) and Pongo abelii (Sumatran). Orangutans exhibit characteristics of a ""slow"" life history strategy with large bodies, late age at maturity, low reproductive rates, and long lifespan. Recently, researchers proposed that Sumatran orangutans may have an even slower life history than Bomean orangutans as a result of ecological and genetic differences (Wich et al., 2004). We examined this hypothesis by studying important aspects of life history of both species under conditions of relative ecological stability, in captivity. In this large dataset, there were no significant species differences in age of first or last reproduction, completed fertility, perinatal and postnatal mortality, or female longevity. Bornean orangutans in captivity did have significantly longer interbirth intervals, and male Bornean orangutans had higher survival past maturity. Our results do not support the hypothesis that selection has led to decreased reproductive effort under conditions of increased habitat quality in Sumatra (Wich et al., 2004), and instead suggest that phenotypic flexibility may be particularly important in explaining differences between closely related species.

A Study on Positive-Negative Mother Image and Father Image shown Anthony Browne's Picture Books,"['정명숙', '유수경', 'yeon, song ju']",Korean Joural of Children's Media,NA,2008,0,"This study analyzed the parents' image, which was shown in 4 books such as Piggybook, My Mum, Gorilla, and My Dad. Those books are the best among Anthony Browne's picture books. First, the mother and father in Piggybook showed the negative mother-and-father image pertaining to the passive, obedient, authoritative, and negative attitude and practiced the unilateral care in the opening part. However, the positive mother-and-father image was indicated in the latter half, which means the mother and the father practice the affectionate, autonomous, and two-way care. Second, in My Mum and My Dad,  the mother and father always showed the positive mother-and-father looks. Third, in Gorilla, the father showed the indifferent and negative image in the opening part but became the autonomous, affectionate, and positive father in the latter half. Fourth, in all the books we researched, the mother and father, who have positive parenting image, had heterosexual character and showed the common characteristic feeling such as satisfaction and happiness due to being supported by their children and family. Accordingly, teachers and parents will need to help their young children to establish positive parenting image by selecting picture books that contains the positive parenting image."
"Position of chromosomes 18, 19, 21 and 22 in 3D-preserved interphase nuclei of human and gorilla and white hand gibbon","['Manvelyan, M', 'Hunstig, F', 'Mrasek, K', 'Bhatt, S', 'Pellestor, F', 'Weise, A', 'Liehr, T']",MOLECULAR CYTOGENETICS,10.1186/1755-8166-1-9,2008,9,"Background: Even though comparative nuclear architecture studies in hominoids are sparse, nuclear chromosome architecture was shown to be conserved during hominoid evolution. Thus, it is suspected that yet unknown biological mechanisms must underlie this observation.

Results: Here for the first time a combination of multicolor banding (MCB) and three-dimensional analysis of interphase cells was used to characterize the position and orientation of human chromosomes #18, #19, #21 and #22 and their homologues in primate B-lymphocytic cells. In general, our data is in concordance with previous studies. The position of the four studied human chromosomes and their homologues were conserved during primate evolution. However, comparison of interphase architecture in human B-lymphocytic cells and sperm revealed differences of localization of acrocentric chromosomes. The latter might be related to the fact that the nucleolus organizing region is not active in sperm.

Conclusion: Studies in different tissue types may characterize more - potentially biologically relevant differences in nuclear architecture."
Pareidolias in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Neglected symptoms that may respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitors,"['Fontenelle, LF']",NEUROCASE,10.1080/13554790802422138,2008,2,"Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a multifaceted and treatable condition. We describe a patient with OCD whose main complaint was the experience of pareidolias (i.e., 'images seen out of shapes'), a symptom that responded to treatment with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Method: Single case report. Results: Mrs A, a 38-year-old married white woman with a history of OCD, reported visualizing faces of witches and gorillas out of floor tiles. She would see these figures without making any effort, and despite the intense discomfort associated with it, was unable to dismiss the images. Her symptoms responded to a therapeutic trial with clomipramine. Conclusion: Patients presenting typical pareidolias need to be probed for underlying OCD. This approach may have material impact on treatment decisions, with good response of the aforementioned condition to serotonin reuptake inhibitors."

A mortality rate of 33% was recorded in the first year post-release, with dependent infants the most affected age class, as a result of environmental stress and malnutrition. A programme of provisioning ensured that individuals remained in a good physical condition. During the second year the death rate decreased to 4%, and 6-month survival rate of infants was 100%. Over time the mandrills extended their spatial use of the park, although their exploration remained limited. Our results demonstrate that provisioning and the lack of knowledge of ecological characteristics of the new, complex seasonal habitat were the likely causes of this situation. After 2 years, reproduction and survival appear stable. While habitat preservation and in situ species protection are the best conservation options, release projects may constitute a viable short-term solution for particular species. In this context, this first release of captive-bred mandrills could play a role in the future conservation of this Vulnerable species."
Ancient fossil specimens of extinct species are genetically more distant to an outgroup than extant sister species are.,"['Huang, Shi']",Rivista di biologia,NA,2008 Jan-Apr,2,"There exists a remarkable correlation between genetic distance as measured by protein or DNA dissimilarity and time of species divergence as inferred from fossil records. This observation has provoked the molecular clock hypothesis. However, data inconsistent with the hypothesis have steadily accumulated in recent years from studies of extant organisms. Here the published DNA and protein sequences from ancient fossil specimens were examined to see if they would support the molecular clock hypothesis. The hypothesis predicts that ancient specimens cannot be genetically more distant to an outgroup than extant sister species are. Also, two distinct ancient specimens cannot be genetically more distant than their extant sister species are. The findings here do not conform to these predictions. Neanderthals are more distant to chimpanzees and gorillas than modern humans are. Dinosaurs are more distant to frogs than extant birds are. Mastodons are more distant to opossums than other placental mammals are. The genetic distance between dinosaurs and mastodons is greater than that between extant birds and mammals. Therefore, while the molecular clock hypothesis is consistent with some data from extant organisms, it has yet to find support from ancient fossils. Far more damaging to the hypothesis than data from extant organisms, which merely question the constancy of mutation rate, the study of ancient fossil organisms here challenges for the first time the fundamental premise of modern evolution theory that genetic distances had always increased with time in the past history of life on Earth."
