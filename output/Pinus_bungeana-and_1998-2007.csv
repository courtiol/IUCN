"Induction, development and maturation of somatic embryos in Bunge's pine (Pinus bungeana Zucc. ex Endl.)","['Zhang, CX', 'Li, Q', 'Kong, LS', 'SPRUCE PICEA-GLAUCA']",PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE,10.1007/s11240-007-9294-4,DEC 2007,12,"Embryogenic tissue was induced from developing immature zygotic embryos in Bunge's pine (Pinus bungeana Zucc. ex Endl.). Induction rate reached 84.4% with our best treatment. Zygotic embryos were dissected from megagametophytes and inoculated on different induction media, DCR1 (Gupta PK, Durzan DJ (1985) Plant Cell Rep 4:177-179), BM1 (Gupta PK, Pullman G (1991) U.S. Patent No. 5,036,00) and MSG (Becwar MR, et al. (1988) Somatic cell genetic of woody plants. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, pp. 1-18), supplemented with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BA). DCR1 was the best medium for initiating embryogenic tissue. Induction rates were affected significantly by developmental stages of explants. The highest induction rate was obtained with embryos collected on either June 20 or June 30 with 10 mg 1(-1) 2, 4-D and 4 mg 1(-1) BA. Embryogenic tissue was subcultured monthly on DCR1 medium supplemented with 0.3 mg 1(-1) 2, 4-D and 0.2 mg 1(-1) a-naphthaleneacetic acid. In order to enhance embryo maturation, embryogenic tissue was transferred onto DCR1 medium for two weeks, in which 1,000 mg 1(-1) myo-inositol was included and all plant growth regulators were eliminated. This pretreated tissue was then transferred onto a maturation medium that was DCR1 medium containing 50 g 1(-1) sucrose and 0.1 mg 1(-1) indolebutyric acid. In this study, benefits of embryo maturation were not observed when abscisic acid and polyethylene glycol were applied in the culture."

Due to the effects of road dust, low height leaf had a larger density of particles. The density of the particles was smaller in summer than in winter because of the rainfall and new leaf growth. The larger the roughness of leaf surface, the larger density of the particles was. In the particles, the overall content of SiO2, CaCO3, CaMg(CO3,), NaCl, 2CaSO4 . H2O, CaSO4 . 2H2O and Fe2O3 was about 10%-30%, and the main minerals were montmorillonite, illite, kaolinite and feldspar. The total content of 21 test elements in the particles reached 16%-37%, among which, Ca, Al, Fe, Mg, K, Na and S occupied 97% or more, while the others were very few and less affected by sampling sites and tree species."
"Changes in the composition of volatile monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes of Pinus armandi, P-tabulaeformis, and P-bungeana in Northwest China","['Chen, H', 'Tang, M', 'Gao, JM', 'Chen, X', 'Li, ZB']",CHEMISTRY OF NATURAL COMPOUNDS,10.1007/s10600-006-0208-1,SEP-OCT 2006,13,"The volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes obtained from the needles and resin of Pinus armandi, P. tabulaeformis, andP. bungeana growing in the Qinling, Taibai, and Huanglong Mountain forest ecosystem were analyzed by means of GC-MS. Forty-eight constituents were identified, and alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, IR-alpha-pinene, beta-caryophyllene, cadindiene, alpha-caryophyllene, D-limonene, and IS-beta-pinene were the major components of the mono- and sesquiterpenes in the needles and resin. The components of the volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes from the needles and resin at Qinling, Taibai, and Huanglong Mountains had remarkable differences in three pine specifies, whereas the monopertene content such as alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, D-limonene, and camphene were mostly changed in the growing stage. The intraspecies variation in the different ecosystems can be attributed to the species' geography and genetic variation, and even the adaptation of the pine species to different ecological environments. Moreover, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes can be induced by the attack of bark beetles, of which the alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, IR-alpha-pinene, IS-alpha-pinene, beta-myrecene, and beta-caryophyllene contents had positive relations with the attacking Dendroctonus armandi and D. valens."
"Chromosomal localization of 5S and 18S rDNA in five species of subgenus Strobus and their implications for genome evolution of Pinus
","['Cai, Q', 'Zhang, DM', 'Liu, ZL', 'Wang, XR']",ANNALS OF BOTANY,10.1093/aob/mcl030,MAY 2006,36,"Background and Aims Studying the genome structure of pines has been hindered by their large genomes and uniform karyotypes. Consequently our understanding of the genome organization and evolutionary changes in different groups of pines is extremely limited. However, techniques are now available that can surmount these difficulties. The purpose of this study was to exploit some of these techniques to characterize the genome differentiation between the two subgenera of Pinus: Pinus and Strobus.

Methods Double-probe fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) was used to localize the 5S and 18S rDNA loci on chromosomes of five species from the subgenus Strobus: P. bungeana, P. koraiensis, P. armandii, P. wallichiana and P. strobus.

Key Results The rDNA FISH pattern varied considerably among the five species, with P. bungeana being the most distinct. By comparing the results obtained with those of previous rDNA FISH studies of members of the subgenus Pinus, several general features of rDNA loci distribution in the genus Pinus can be discerned: (a) species of subgenus Strobus generally have more rDNA loci than species of subgenus Pinus, correlating with their larger genomes in the subgenus Strobus; (b) there is a clear differentiation in 5S and 18S rDNA loci linkage patterns between the two subgenera; (c) variations in the rDNA FISH pattern correlate with phylogenetic relationships among species within the subgenus; (d) P. bungeana has fewer 18S rDNA sites than other pines investigated to date, but they give intense signals, and may reflect the primary distribution of the 18S-25S rDNA loci in the genus.

Conclusions The stable differentiation in rDNA FISH pattern between the subgenera suggests that chromosomal rearrangements played a role in the splitting of the two subgenera, and transpositional events rather than major structural changes are likely responsible for the variable rDNA distribution patterns among species of the same subgenus with conserved karyotypes."
"A rapid, efficient method for the mass production of pollen protoplasts from Pinus bungeana Zucc. ex Endl. and Picea wilsonii Mast.","['Fang, KF', 'Zhang, LY', 'Lin, JX']",FLORA,10.1016/j.flora.2005.04.005,2006,1,"An optimized protocol was established to isolate large numbers of mature living pollen protoplasts of Pinus bungeana Zucc. ex Endl. and Picea wilsonii Mast. Intact pollen grains of P. bungeana or pollen with short tubes were incubated with gentle agitation in a solution of 2% cellulase R-10, 1.5% macerozyme R-10, 15% sucrose, 0.01% H3BO3, and 0.01% CaCl2. Intact pollen protoplasts with diameters of 40 mu m were liberated, with an isolation rate of up to 70% after 6 h of enzymatic incubation. The optimal pH and temperature for the reaction were 5.8 and 24 degrees C, respectively, and the optimal enzymatic digestion conditions were 6 h of incubation in the above solution. The method for isolating pollen protoplasts from P. wilsonii was similar to that for P. bungeana, except that the incubation medium contained 12% rather than 15% sucrose and the optimal enzyme concentrations were 3% cellulase and 2% macerozyme. The isolated pollen protoplasts were demonstrated to be living by microscopy in a fluorochromatic reaction with fluorescein diacetate (FDA). (C) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."
WOOD FRACTURE PATTERN DURING THE WATER DESORPTION PROCESS,"['Wang, Liyu', 'Zhao, Guangjie', 'Lu, Zhenyou']",Maderas. Ciencia y tecnología,10.4067/S0718-221X2006000100003,2006,0,"Wood is a hygroscopic material and its mechanical properties change with moisture content below the fiber saturation point. Fracture characteristic is one of most important mechanical properties of wood and often is taken as an important safety design factor for wood as an engineered structural material. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of moisture content changes on wood fracture properties, focusing on fracture behavior and patterns with different crack orientations of Betula platyphylla Suk. and Pinus bungeana in two different desorption processes. These two desorption processes were, respectively, from fiber saturation point to an equilibrium moisture content corresponding to 82.4 %RH at 20°C and from 82.4 %RH to 35.2 %RH at the same temperature of 20 °C"
Heterotrimeric G protein alpha-subunit is localized in the plasma membrane of Pinus bungeana pollen tubes,"['Zhang, LY', 'Fang, KF', 'Lin, JX']",PLANT SCIENCE,10.1016/j.plantsci.2005.07.015,DEC 2005,2,"Heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in a variety of cellular responses, but relatively little is known about their function and biochemistry in plant pollen. In this paper, we establish the presence of a G protein associated with the plasma membranes of Pinus bungeana pollen tube. A 40 kDa polypeptide is detected and immunolocalized predominantly in pollen tube plasma membranes by polyclonal antisera directed against conserved peptides of mammalian G alpha-subunit during pollen tube development. Cholera and pertussis toxins exhibited biphasic actions on tube growth, that is to say, inhibited pollen tube growth and result in rupture of tubes at concentrations less than 400 ng mL(-1), whereas stimulated pollen tube growth at concentration over 500 ng mL(-1). Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra showed that the two toxins at concentrations of 400 ng mL(-1) resulted in enhanced synthesis of phenolics and reduced synthesis of cellulose, hemicellulose, and xylan of pollen tube wall, which may account for incidental rupture of pollen tubes at the concentration. These results suggest that the two toxins possibly affect pollen tube growth via downstream pertussis or cholera toxin-sensitive functional proteins, which regulate tube wall biosynthesis than at the G alpha-subunit in P. bungeana tube growth.

"Casparian strips in needles are more solute permeable than endodermal transport barriers in roots of Pinus bungeana
","['Wu, XQ', 'Lin, JX', 'Lin, QQ', 'Wang, J', 'Schreiber, L']",PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY,10.1093/pcp/pci194,NOV 2005,10,"The structure and development of endodermal Casparian strips in Pinus bungeana needles and roots were studied by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Primary pit fields (PFs) frequently occurred in radial walls of Casparian strips isolated from needles, whereas PFs were never detected in Casparian strips from roots. Formation of Casparian strips in needles as well as roots started at the outer parts of the radial walls and they finally occupied the entire radial walls of the endodermis. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of Casparian strips isolated from roots revealed significant absorption bands characteristic for suberin. However, in Casparian strips of needles, evidence for suberin was rarely detected by FTIR spectroscopy. The apoplastic permeability of Casparian strips in needles and roots was probed by the apoplastic tracers calcofluor and berberine. Casparian strips in roots efficiently blocked the apoplastic transport (AT) of calcofluor and berberine. Casparian strips in needles blocked the AT of calcofluor, but diffusion of berberine was not inhibited and berberine thiocyanate crystals were detectable in the vascular tissue of the needles. From the data presented, it must be concluded that Casparian strips in needles, which are characterized by the absence of suberin, are more solute permeable compared with Casparian strips in roots."
Volatile organic compounds and their roles in bacteriostasis in five conifer species,"['Gao, Y', 'Jin, YJ', 'Li, HD', 'Chen, HJ']",JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE PLANT BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1744-7909.2005.00081.x,APR 2005,15,"In order to make clear the functions of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on bacteriostasis and air decontamination, we analyzed the composition and content of VOCs in Pinus tabulaeformis Carr., P. bungeana Zucc., Sabina chinensis Antoine, Picea koraiensis Nakai, and Cedrus deodara G. Don under near-natural conditions using the thermal-desorption cold trap gas chromatography/mass spectrometer technique. The effects of the VOCs on airborne microorganisms were investigated using the method of natural sedimentation. Results showed that the major VOCs were as follows: limonene, beta-pinene, alpha-pinene, and alpha-caryophyllene in Pinus tabulaefonnis and P. bungeana; limonene, borneol acetate, beta-pinene, myrcene, and tricylene in S. chinensis; limonene, alpha-pinene, myrcene, camphene, and beta-pinene in Picea koraiensis; and limonene, 2, (10)-pinene, alpha-pinene, and myrcene in C. deodara. These VOCs and the corresponding foliar extracts inhibited the growth of bacteria and stimulated the growth of fungi. Experimental data using monomers of the VOCs demonstrated that limonene, beta-pinene, and three aldehydes could significantly inhibit bacterial growth, suggesting an inhibitory effect of VOCs on the growth of airborne microorganisms in the five conifer species. The bacteriostasis and air-decontaminating effects of plant VOCs are further discussed in terms of their chemical composition."
Inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis in pollen tube development of Pinus bungeana by actinomycin D and cycloheximide,"['Hao, HQ', 'Li, YQ', 'Hu, YX', 'Lin, JX']",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01290.x,MAR 2005,19,"The effects of actinomycin D and cycloheximide on RNA and protein synthesis were investigated during pollen tube development of Pinus bungeana.

RNA and protein contents, protein expression patterns, cell wall components and ultrastructural changes of pollen tubes were studied using spectrophotometry, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Pollen grains germinated in the presence of actinomycin D, but tube elongation and RNA synthesis were inhibited. By contrast, cycloheximide inhibited pollen germination and protein synthesis, induced abnormal tube morphology, and retarded the tube growth rate. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that protein expression patterns changed distinctly, with some proteins being specific for each phase. FTIR microspectroscopy established significant changes in the chemical composition of pollen tube walls. TEM analysis revealed the inhibitors caused disintegration of organelles involved in the secretory system.

These results suggested RNA necessary for pollen germination and early tube growth were present already in the pollen grains before germination, while the initiation of germination and the maintenance of pollen tube elongation depended on continuous protein synthesis."
Molecular Phylogeny of section Parrya of Pinus (Pinaceae) based on chloroplast matK gene sequence data,"['Zhang, ZY', 'Li, DZ']",ACTA BOTANICA SINICA,NA,FEB 2004,6,"The molecular phylogenetics of sect. Parrya Myre of Pinus L. was analyzed based on chloroplast matK gene sequence data. The section was resolved as paraphyletic because members of the sect. Strobus were nested within a clade composed by the Asian members of the section, including the Vietnamese P. krempfii Lecomte, which was strongly supported with a bootstrap value of 92%. In this topology, the three sampled species of sect. Strobus formed a strongly supported monophyletic group, while their relationships of Asian species of sect. Parrya were not clear. P. krempfii was grouped with P. gerardiana Wall. ex D. Don with low bootstrap support. The relationships among the Asian members of the sect. Parrya, i.e. P. bungeana Zucc. ex Loud., P gerardiana and the recently described endangered pine, P squamata X. W. Li, was not resolved, although the monophyly of the three pines was strongly supported in the combined analysis of four cpDNA sequences. The topology of the neighbor joining tree revealed an assemblage of the American members of the section, which also appeared in the majority rule tree with weak bootstrap support. However, this assemblage was not resolved in the consensus tree of the parsimonious analysis. The American subsect. Balfourianae Engelm. formed a weakly supported group including P aristata Engelm., while the relationships among and within the other two American subsections, Cembroides Englem. and Rzedowskianae Carv., were not resolved, as the members of them formed a polytomy in the consensus tree of the parsimonious analysis. The biogeographical implications of the results are also discussed in this paper."
[Dust absorption effect of urban conifers in northeast China].,"['Chen, Wei', 'He, Xingyuan', 'Zhang, Yue', 'Sun, Yu', 'Wang, Wenfei', 'Ning, Zhuhua']","Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology / Zhongguo sheng tai xue xue hui, Zhongguo ke xue yuan Shenyang ying yong sheng tai yan jiu suo zhu ban",NA,2003-Dec,0,"Dust pollution is much heavier in winter than in other seasons in the cities of Northeast China, because the urban heating system consumes mainly coal as energy resources. Deciduous trees can hardly absorb dust because of their defoliation, and hence, urban conifer trees become more important in dust absorption in winter. This paper studied the dust absorption ability of 7 conifers under the same and different dust pollution status in Shenyang city, Northeast China. The results showed that the dust absorption ability of conifers was decreased in the order of Abies holophilla > Picea mongolica > P. koraiensis > Taxus cupidata > Pinus bungeana > P. armandi > P. tabulaeformis. Different conifers had different surface structures. Pinus bungeana, P. armandi and P. tabulaeformis had smooth surfaces, their cells and stomata arranged in order, and hence, their dust absorption ability was poor. P. koraiensis, Abies holophilla and Taxus cupidata had coarse surfaces, and their cells and stomata arranged out of order. There were even many tubercular things on the surface of P. koraiensis, and hence, their dust absorption ability was stronger. The dust absorption ability of conifers was related the shape of their leaf sections. The upper leaf surface of Pinus bungeana and P. tabulaeformis was arc, not opted to absorb the dust. The leaf section of P. armandi was prism, and its upper surface was narrow, and hence, its dust absorption ability was also poor. The leaves of Picea mongolica and P. koraiensis had four edges, their upper surfaces were broader and flatter than the former three species, and hence, they had stronger dust absorption ability. The leaf section's shape of Abies holophilla and Taxus cupidata was also broad and flat, which made the dust absorption ability of the two latter's was stronger than other three Pinus species and two Picea species."
"Phylogenetic relationship of an extremely endangered species, Pinus squamata (Pinaceae) inferred from four sequences of the chloroplast genome and ITS of the nuclear ribosomal DNA","['Zhang, ZY', 'Yang, JB', 'Li, DZ']",ACTA BOTANICA SINICA,NA,MAY 2003,5,"Pinus squamata X. W. Li, a recently-described species of the Pinaceae, is an extremely endangered pine with only 32 individuals in the wild. This species was thought to be intermediate between P. bungeana Zuec. ex Endl. of subgen. Strobus and P. yunnanensis Franch. of subgen. Pinus by the original author. We made an effort to address the question of the phylogenetic relationship of this peculiar and important species in the context of the major groups of the genus Pinus by using sequences of the rbcL, matK,genes, rpl20-rps18 spacer, trnV intron of the chloroplast genome and the nuclear ribosomal ITS region. The results of the separated analysis and the combined analysis of the four cpDNA sequences and ITS sequence indicated that P. squamata was a stable member of subsect. Gerardianae and P. gerardiana Wall. was the closest species of P. squamata phylogenetically. As a result, the causes of the distribution pattern of subsect. Gerardianae were also discussed."

Wood fracture pattern during the water adsorption process,"['Wang, LY', 'Lu, ZY', 'Zhao, GJ']",HOLZFORSCHUNG,NA,2003,7,"A research program was conducted to investigate the effect of water transition on wood fracture properties, focusing on fracture behavior and patterns with different crack orientations of Betula platyphylla Suk. and Pinus bungeana in three different moisture adsorption processes. At a constant temperature of 20degreesC, three levels of relative humidity were considered: 66%, 82% and 100%. The results indicated that moisture content did not influence the crack propagation path, while specimen crack orientation did.With longer moisture adsorption times, the time needed to reach the maximum load from the critical load also grew; this is because below the fiber saturation point, from excessive dryness to a certain moisture content, the cell wall becomes less brittle and the toughness is enhanced. At 20degreesC constant temperature, the fracture toughness gradually increased from ovendry state adsorbing moisture to 82% relative humidity, but decreased from 82% to 100% relative humidity.Within a tree species, fracture toughness depended on specimen type.The fracture toughness of LT specimens was by far higher than that of TL and TR specimens. The LT specimen fracture toughness of Betula platyphylla Suk. was comparable to that of Pinus bungeana."
[Characterization of 5S rRNA gene sequence and secondary structure in gymnosperms].,"['Liu, Zhan-Lin', 'Zhang, Da-Ming', 'Wang, Xiao-Ru']",Yi chuan xue bao = Acta genetica Sinica,NA,2003-Jan,0,"In higher plants the primary and the secondary structures of 5S ribosomal RNA gene are considered highly conservative. Little is known about the 5S rRNA gene structure, organization and variation in gyimnosperms. In this study we analyzed sequence and structure variation of 5S rRNA gene in Pinus through cloning and sequencing multiple copies of 5S rDNA repeats from individual trees of five pines, P. bungeana, P. tabulaeformis, P. yunnanensis, P. massoniana and P. densata. Pinus bungeana is from the subgenus Strobus while the other four are from the subgenus Pinus (diploxylon pines). Our results revealed variations in both primary and secondary structure among copies of 5S rDNA within individual genomes and between species. 5S rRNA gene in Pinus is 120 bp long in most of the 122 clones we sequenced except for one or two deletions in three clones. Among these clones 50 unique sequences were identified and they were shared by different pine species. Our sequences were compared to 13 sequences each representing a different gymnosperm species, and to six sequences representing both angiosperm monocots and dicots. Average sequence similarity was 97.1% among Pinus species and 94.3% between Pinus and other gymnosperms. Between gymnosperms and angiosperms the sequence similarity decreased to 88.1%. Similar to other molecular data, significant sequence divergence was found between the two Pinus subgenera. The 5S gene tree (neighbor-joining tree) grouped the four diploxylon pines together and separated them distinctly from P. bungeana. Comparison of sequence divergence within individuals and between species suggested that concerted evolution has been very weak especially after the divergence of the four diploxylon pines. The phylogenetic information contained in the 5S rRNA gene is limited due to its shorter length and the difficulties in identifying orthologous and paralogous copies of rDNA multigene family further complicate its phylogenetic application. Pinus densata is a diploid hybrid between P. tabulaeformis and P. yunnanensis. Its 5S rDNA composition is consistent with its hybrid origin. 5S rRNA of all gymnosperms published so far could be folded into a general secondary structure. Variation in this secondary structure was detected among species. About 55% of the 120 bp nucleotide positions was variable, in which 68% was on stem regions. Nevertheless, the positions at the end of the stems and those adjacent to loops are conserved. Their stability directly determines the size of the loops. Some mutations such as compensatory base-pair substitutions, and G-U pairing could be regarded as mechanisms for maintaining a stable secondary structure. The loops of the secondary structure are also relatively conserved. It seems that stable helices are necessary for the function of the gene. The conserved nucleotides in the loops are probably involved in the interaction with proteins and/or RNAs or with other nucleotide in the formation of the tertiary structure. However, unlike other reports, Loop E was found quite mutable among pines. These variations together with those on stems might be caused by the presence of pseudogenes among our clones. A preliminary evaluation indicates that only seven of 50 unique sequences are potentially functional genes."

The seeds from northern part of distribution area had a much higher water permeability than from the south. According to water permeability, the seven seed sources were divided into 2 geographical groups, with Qinling Mountain as the division line. The difference of seed ventilation was caused firstly by outer seed capsule, and secondly by inner one. The variation of permeability had a similar trend with the ventilation. The inhibition ability of seed extracts was significantly different among different seed sources, which was increased with the concentration of seed extracts. Based on the inhibition ability of extracts from seed capsule and endosperm, the seven seed sources were divided into 2 and 3 geographical groups, respectively. The germination capacity decreased with increasing latitude, and seeds with poor germination capacity took relatively more time for germination. All population groups based on different division criteria showed such a character, i.e., the difference of seed characteristics was more significant among groups than in same group, and the distance of seed source was longer among groups than in a group. The difference of dormancy characteristics of different P. bungeana seed sources was the result of interaction between climatic and geographical factors."
