Rapidly shifting environmental baselines among fishers of the Gulf of California,"['Saenz-Arroyo, A', 'Roberts, CM', 'Torre, J', 'Carino-Olvera, M', 'Enriquez-Andrade, RR', 'FAUNA']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rspb.2005.3175,SEP 22 2005,122,"Shifting environmental baselines are inter-generational changes in perception of the state of the environment. As one generation replaces another, people's perceptions of what is natural change even to the extent that they no longer believe historical anecdotes of past abundance or size of species. Although widely accepted, this phenomenon has yet to be quantitatively tested. Here we survey three generations of fishers from Mexico's Gulf of California (N= 108), where fish populations have declined steeply over the last 60 years, to investigate how far and fast their environmental baselines are shifting. Compared to young fishers, old fishers named five times as many species and four times as many fishing sites as once being abundant/productive but now depleted (Kruskal-Wallis tests, both p < 0.001) with no evidence of a slowdown in rates of loss experienced by younger compared to older generations (Kruskal-Wallis test, n.s. in both cases). Old fishers caught up to 25 times as many Gulf grouper Mycteroperca jordani as young fishers on their best ever fishing day (regression r(2) = 0.62, p < 0.001). Despite times of plentiful large fish still being within living memory, few young fishers appreciated that large species had ever been common or nearshore sites productive. Such rapid shifts in perception of what is natural help explain why society is tolerant of the creeping loss of biodiversity. They imply a large educational hurdle in efforts to reset expectations and targets for conservation."
Spawning aggregations and reproductive behavior of reef fishes in the Gulf of California,"['Sala, E', 'Aburto-Oropeza, O', 'Paredes, G', 'Thompson, G']",BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE,NA,JAN 2003,64,"Spawning aggregations numbering up to tens of thousands of reef fishes have disappeared throughout the tropics due to fishing, causing the collapse of their populations and of commercial fisheries in many regions. Although there is a wealth of information on spawning aggregations in the Caribbean and the Indopacific, there are almost no data on spawning aggregations of commercial reef fishes in the Tropical Eastern Pacific. Here we describe aggregations and the reproductive behavior of eight species of reef fishes in the Gulf of California, Mexico. The serranids Mycteroperca prionura and M. rosacea, the snapper Lutjanus novemfasciatus, and the jacks Caranx sexfasciatus and Seriola lalandi form spawning aggregations of 12 to > 1000 individuals on islands, exposed coastal rocky reefs, and seamounts. The serranids Paranthias colonus and the snapper L. argentiventris spawn in schools with densities similar to these during non-reproductive periods. We observed aggregations of the serranid M. jordani but (lid not observe spawning. Some spawning aggregations of these and other species (such as Epinephelus itajara and Stereolepis gigas) have now disappeared from the Gulf of California due to fishing. Our findings suggest the existence of undocumented spawning aggregations throughout the Tropical Eastern Pacific that sustain varied levels of fishing pressure. These spawning aggregations must be identified and protected in order to ensure the replenishment of fish populations."
