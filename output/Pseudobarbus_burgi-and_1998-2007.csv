"Karyology of the redfin minnows, genus Pseudobarbus Smith, 1841 (Teleostei : Cyprinidae): one of the evolutionarily tetraploid lineages of South African barbines","['Naran, D', 'Skelton, PH', 'Villet, MH']",AFRICAN ZOOLOGY,10.3377/1562-7020(2006)41[178:KOTRMG]2.0.CO;2,OCT 2006,4,"The karyotypes of six species of Pseudobarbus Smith, 1841, namely R afer (Peters, 1864), R asper (Boulenger, 1911), R burchelli Smith, 1841, R burgi (Boulenger, 1911), R phlegethon (Barnard, 1938) and R tenuis (Barnard, 1938), were examined by conventional Giemsa staining and described. All six karyotypes have 2n = 100 chromosomes, dominated by biarmed chromosomes, as does the only other member of the genus, R quathlambae (Barnard, 1938). Sex-related intraspecific karyotype variation was not found. The shared chromosome numbers and general similarity of the karyotypes (FN = 186-192) provide a new synapomorphy to support their monophyly, which is already indicated by anatomical and mtDNA markers. Karyotype evolution within the genus has been accompanied by chromosomal inversions and centromeric shifts. Comparison of the diploid number found in Pseudobarbus with other African barbine cyprinines, which have in the region of 2n = 50 and lower FNs, suggests a tetraploid evolutionary origin of the genus, possibly by allotetraploidy,"

Mitochondrial DNA differentiation in the critically endangered Berg River redfin (Pseudobarbus burgi),"['Bloomer, P', 'Impson, ND']",JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,10.1093/jhered/91.2.122,MAR-APR 2000,11,"The Berg River redfin (Pseudobarbus burgi) is a critically endangered endemic cyprinid from South Africa. We investigated mitochondrial DNA control region variation among specimens representative of five populations drawn from two adjacent river systems. Phylogenetic analyses, a minimum spanning network, and an analysis of molecular variance underscore the pronounced genetic separation of redfins originating from the geographically closely allied Verlorevlei and Berg Rivers, two populations that may have remained isolated since the Pleistocene. Despite a lack of geographic structuring within the Berg River, historic female gene flow among the upper and middle/lower parts of the river appears to be limited and the contemporary populations are probably isolated due to deterioration of the mainstream of the river. Our results suggest that the Berg and Verlorevlei populations should be managed as distinct conservation units. We encourage the use of sanctuaries, particularly by private landowners within both river systems, as this approach may contribute effectively to preserving genetic diversity within the species."
