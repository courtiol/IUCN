Single-sample estimation of effective population size in several populations of the endangered Hine's emerald dragonfly,"['Monroe, EM', 'Britten, HB']",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,10.1086/682073,SEP 2015,1,"Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana) is the only odonate on the US Endangered Species list. It prefers discrete fen-and-wet-meadow habitat from Ontario, Canada, to Missouri, USA. This habitat has been destroyed across much of S. hineana's range. Its conservation genetics were assessed by microsatellite analysis in a previous study. We applied 2 common single-sample estimators to the same data set to estimate effective population size (N-e), or effective number of breeders, in 5 populations (separated into adult and naiad stage classes) across the species' range in 2008 and 2010-2011. Populations of the species in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the Door Peninsula of Wisconsin, and along the Des Plaines River Valley in Illinois are made up of individuals collected from multiple sites, but the other 2 populations, at Cedarburg Bog, Wisconsin, and along the Lower Wisconsin River, consist of samples from single habitats disjunct from other known sites. N-e for S. hineana were similar to those for other endangered insects and ranged from 22 adults in the Des Plaines River Valley population in 2010 to 200 adults in the Door Peninsula population in 2010 based on approximate Bayesian estimation in ONeSAMP and from 8 naiads in the Door Peninsula population to 419 adults in the Des Plaines River Valley population based on the linkage disequilibrium method in NeEstimator. These N-e values confirm the endangered status of this species and indicate that efforts to maintain current habitats and connectivity to suitable habitat are essential to maintaining genetic diversity."
The potential of diversion structures to reduce roadway mortality of the endangered Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana),"['Furness, AN', 'Soluk, DA']",JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,10.1007/s10841-015-9765-6,JUN 2015,1,"Roadways near wetlands and ponds inflict high roadkill rates on a wide variety of taxa. For threatened or endangered species that typically do not have large adult populations, fast reproduction rates, and/or rapid recolonization rates, such mortality is likely to have significant population consequences. Thus, exploring ways to reduce roadkill rates will have considerable conservation benefits. In this study, we evaluate whether a diversion structure can be used to modify flight behavior of the endangered Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana) in ways that would reduce roadway mortality. Flight behavior of adult S. hineana was observed with and without two 3 m high nets spaced at 6 and 12 m to simulate a small and a larger roadway. The netting significantly deterred (p < 0.0001) S. hineana adults from crossing the simulated roadway. Flight height was also influenced significantly (p = 0.0025) with flight heights over the 6 m net spacing being higher than those over the 12 m spacing. This study suggests that the use of diversion netting in areas where sensitive dragonfly species interact with motor vehicles might aid in reducing roadway mortality and might help reduce the overall impact of roadways on wetland ecosystems."
"Conservation in Hine's sight: the conservation genetics of the federally endangered Hine's emerald dragonfly, Somatochlora hineana
","['Monroe, EM', 'Britten, HB']",JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,10.1007/s10841-014-9643-7,JUN 2014,2,"Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana) is distributed in discrete fen and wet meadow habitats over its range from Ontario, Canada, to Missouri, USA. Habitat destruction in the vicinity of Chicago, IL, and other areas lead to its designation as an US federal endangered species in 1995. Our main goal was to delineate the population genetic structure of the species within the northern recovery unit centered on the Door Peninsula in Wisconsin and the southern recovery unit in the Des Plaines River Valley near Chicago, IL. Sites on the Door Peninsula, WI, are in a matrix of agricultural development and second-growth forest and were used as a best available approximation of a pristine system for the dragonfly. We nondestructively sampled 557 adults and larvae from 16 sites in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin from 2008 through 2011 and used ten microsatellite markers to estimate levels of genetic variability, and genetic structure. Mean allelic richness across all sites and years was 5.03 (+/- 0.64) and expected heterozygosity was 0.52 (+/- 0.032). Northern and southern recovery units as designated in the original recovery plan were genetically distinct. We delineated two genetic populations in the northern unit and three within the southern including two disjunct sites."
Nonlethal Tissue Sampling Techniques and Microsatellite Markers Used for First Report of Genetic Diversity in Two Populations of the Endangered Somatochlora hineana (Odonata: Corduliidae),"['Monroe, EM', 'Lynch, C', 'Soluk, DA', 'Britten, HB']",ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,10.1603/AN10088,NOV 2010,9,"Techniques for obtaining DNA noninvasively or nonlethally are highly desirable in molecular genetic studies of protected species, and several advances have been made in these types of sampling and extraction techniques. Insects present a unique set of difficulties in this regard that are not present when working with most vertebrates. This study evaluated the effectiveness of several nonlethal sampling techniques for larval and adults of the federally listed endangered dragonfly Somatochlora hineana (Williamson) (Odonata: Corduliidae). Fecal pellets and shed exuviae from captive S. hineana larvae did not provide high enough quality DNA for microsatellite analyses. Invasive, but nonlethal, wing clips from adults and tarsi from larvae provided high-quality DNA that amplified 10 microsatellite markers for this species. Ten loci were polymorphic in 94 specimens with four to 14 alleles per locus. Two populations in WI had average observed heterozygosity of 0.47, which is within the range reported for other donates. Our sampling techniques and these new microsatellite markers provide an essential tool for determining the genetic structure of S. hineana populations throughout its range."
