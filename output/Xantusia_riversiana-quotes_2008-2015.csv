THREATENED SAN CLEMENTE BELL'S SPARROW NEST DEPREDATED BY ISLAND NIGHT LIZARD,"['Bridges, AS', 'Biteman, DS', 'Deleon, EE', 'Cross, BE']",WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST,NA,AUG 2015,0,"We used remote video monitoring systems to document nest predators at San Clemente Bell's Sparrow (Artemisiospiza belli clementeae) nests and recorded an unexpected depredation by an island night lizard (Xantusia riversiana) on 22 May 2013. This record is the first documented case of a San Clemente Bell's Sparrow being depredated by any reptile and is also the first documentation of any night lizard species ( genus Xantusia) depredating a bird's nest. Additionally, we found that night lizards are among the smallest lizard species ever observed depredating a bird's nest."
"Development and characterization of 12 microsatellite markers for the Island Night Lizard (Xantusia riversiana), a threatened species endemic to the Channel Islands, California, USA","[""O'Donnell, RP"", 'Drost, CA', 'Mock, KE']",CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES,10.1007/s12686-014-0189-5,SEP 2014,0,"The Island Night Lizard is a federally threatened species endemic to the Channel Islands of California. Twelve microsatellite loci were developed for use in this species and screened in 197 individuals from across San Nicolas Island, California. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 6 to 21. Observed heterozygosities ranged from 0.520 to 0.843. These microsatellite loci will be used to investigate population structure, effective population size, and gene flow across the island, to inform protection and management of this species."
Phylogenetic relationships within the lizard clade Xantusiidae: Using trees and divergence times to address evolutionary questions at multiple levels,"['Noonan, BP', 'Pramuk, JB', 'Bezy, RL', 'Sinclair, EA', 'de Queiroz, K', 'Sites, JW']",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.ympev.2013.05.017,OCT 2013,2,"Xantusiidae (night lizards) is a clade of small-bodied, cryptic lizards endemic to the New World. The clade is characterized by several features that would benefit from interpretation in a phylogenetic context, including: (1) monophyletic status of extant taxa Cricosaura, Lepidophyma, and Xantusia; (2) a species endemic to Cuba (Cricosaura typica) of disputed age; (3) origins of the parthenogenetic species of Lepidophyma; (4) pronounced micro-habitat differences accompanied by distinct morphologies in both Xantusia and Lepidophyma; and (5) placement of Xantusia riversiana, the only vertebrate species endemic to the California Channel Islands, which is highly divergent from its mainland relatives. This study incorporates extensive new character data from multiple gene regions to investigate the phylogeny of Xantusiidae using the most comprehensive taxonomic sampling available to date. Parsimony and partitioned Bayesian analyses of more than 7 kb of mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data from 11 loci all confirm that Xantusiidae is monophyletic, and comprises three well-supported clades: Cricosaura, Xantusia, and Lepidophyma. The Cuban endemic Cricosaura typica is well supported as the sister to all other xantusiids. Estimates of divergence time indicate that Cricosaura diverged from the (Lepidophyma + Xantusia) clade similar to 81 million years ago (Ma), a time frame consistent with the separation of the Antilles from North America. Our results also confirm and extend an earlier study suggesting that parthenogenesis has arisen at least twice within Lepidophyma without hybridization, that rock-crevice ecomorphs evolved numerous times (>9) within Xantusia and Lepidophyma, and that the large-bodied Channel Island endemic X. riversiana is a distinct, early lineage that may form the sister group to the small-bodied congeners of the mainland.
