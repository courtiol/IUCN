"Distribution, habitat selection and behaviour of the East Coast Akalat Sheppardia gunningi sokokensis in Kenya and Tanzania","['Nemeth, E', 'Bennun, L']",BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL,10.1017/S0959270900000113,JUN 2000,4,"This study investigated the distribution and habitat selection of the globally threatened East Coast Akalat Sheppardia gunningi sokokensis in Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, the Shimba Hills (both Kenya) and the lowland East Usambara Mountains (Tanzania). The species is more abundant than originally thought. In Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, akalats occur in two of the main vegetation types, and an estimated 7,500-9,000 territories represent one of the largest populations of this species in the world. Akalats occurred at similar densities to those in Arabuko-Sokoke (c. 0.5 pairs/ha) in parts of Shimba Hills and East Usambaras, but were more patchily distributed. This akalat prefers areas where the undergrowth is partially open with large amounts of dead wood. It forages on or near the ground. In Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, areas where akalats were present had a higher abundance of ground-dwelling arthropods than areas where they were not. The akalat inhabits both primary forest and regenerated areas that have been selectively logged probably more than 20 years ago. Despite its relatively high densities where it occurs, this species (like other threatened birds in the East African coastal forests) is very patchily distributed and dependent on a habitat that is now highly fragmented and under considerable human pressure. The conservation situation in Arabuko-Sokoke gives cause for concern, and the destructive effects of a large elephant population threaten the forests of the Shimba Hills. The conservation status of the lowland Usambara Mountains is probably better and more stable."
The avifauna of coastal forests in southern Kenya: status and conservation,"['Waiyaki, E', 'Bennun, LA']",OSTRICH,10.1080/00306525.2000.9639923,MAR 2000,3,"The biological importance and uniqueness of East African coastal forests is widely recognised; they form an Endemic Bird Area. Important remnants of this fragmented habitat occur on the southern Kenyan coast, but their avifauna has been little studied. In October 1992, September 1993 and May-August 1994, we systematically assessed the avifauna of fifteen South Coast forest fragments land the threats facing them) using mist-netting, timed species counts and direct observations. Sixty forest-dependent bird species were recorded, amongst them three that are globally threatened (Sokoke Pipit Anthus sokokensis, Spotted Ground Thrush Turdus fischeri, East Coast Akalat Sheppardia gunningi) three that are near-threatened (Southern Banded Snake Eagle Circaetus fasciolatus, Fischer's Turaco Tauraco fischeri, Plain-backed Sunbird Anthreptes reichenowi) and four that are 'restricted-range' (Fischer's Turaco, Sokoke Pipit, Mombasa Woodpecker Campethera mombassica, Uluguru Violet-backed Sunbird Anthreptes neglectus). Globally or regionally threatened and near-threatened species were relatively rare and were patchily distributed across forests. In contrast, most other forest species were widely distributed being present in most or all fragments. The breakdown of traditional conservation systems, selective logging, encroachment by cultivation and fire-maintained grassland, fragmentation, allocation of land for urban development, pole cutting, charcoal burning, hunting and trapping, prospective mining, bark stripping and elephant damage are the major threats to the continued survival of these forests. Shimba Hills (Mkongani & Longomagandi), Gandini, Mrima, Marenji, Dzombo, Waa, Buda and Gongoni forests met the criteria for Globally Important Bird Areas set by Birdlife International. A number of urgent steps are needed for improved forest management if these important sites are to survive and retain their biological diversity."
"Distribution and population size of the threatened East Coast Akalat in Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, Kenya","['Matiku, PM', 'Bennun, LA', 'Nemeth, E']",OSTRICH,10.1080/00306525.2000.9639928,MAR 2000,3,"The East Coast Akalat Sheppardia gunningi sokokensis is one of six globally threatened bird species that occur in the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, the largest remnant of forest on the East African coast. The akalat has been little studied but appears to have a patchy distribution both between and within forests. From October 1995 to February 1996 we studied the akalat's status in Arabuko-Sokoke, carrying out transect counts and plot-based surveys to determine its distribution and population size. Playback of calls was used to stimulate the bird to reveal its presence. The akalat was present in two of the forest's main vegetation types, Cynometra woodland and Mixed forest. It was absent from the more open Brachystegia woodland, and from low-canopied intermediate Cynometra and Cynometra a thicket. In Cynometra woodland, the akalats were evenly distributed at high densities (estimated at 87 pairs/km(2)). Within the Mixed forest distribution was patchy, and the akalats were absent from areas with high human disturbance. Where the species did occur, densities were lower (estimated at 12 pairs/km(2)) than in the Cynometra woodland. Arabuko-Sokoke may hold up to 9 000 pairs of this species, perhaps the largest single population in the world. Most of these are in the Cynometra woodland, which is also of crucial conservation importance for the threatened Sokoke Scops Owl Otus ireneae."
"Notes on the ecology and conservation status of key bird species in Nilo and Nguu North Forest Reserves, Tanzania","['Seddon, N', 'Ekstrom, JMM', 'Capper, DR', 'Isherwood, IS', 'Muna, R', 'Pople, RG', 'Tarimo, E', 'Timothy, J']",BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL,NA,MAR 1999,3,"Ornithological surveys were conducted in Tanzanian submontane forest at Nilo Forest Reserve in the East Usambaras and Nguu North Forest Reserve in the Nguu Mountains in July-September 1995. Information on the ecology of poorly known bird species of conservation interest was collected and combined with previously published information to assess their conservation status. Sixteen species of conservation interest were recorded during fieldwork, including five Vulnerable (Usambara Eagle Owl Bubo vosseleri, East Coast Akalat Sheppardia gunningi, Amani Sunbird Anthreptes pallidigaster, Banded Green Sunbird Anthreptes rubritorques and Usambara Weaver Ploceus nicolli); three Near-threatened (Southern Banded Snake Eagle Circaetus fasciolatus, Fischer's Turaco Tauraco fischeri and Moreau's Sunbird Nectarinia moreaui); one regionally Endangered (Southern Hyliota Hyliota australis); one regionally Vulnerable (Uluguru Violet-backed Sunbird Anthreptes neglectus), two regionally Near-threatened (Lemon Dove Aplopelia lavata and Evergreen Forest Warbler Bradypterus barratti); and 10 in total as restricted-range species (Fischer's Turaco, Usambara Eagle Owl, Sharpe's Akalat Sheppardia sharpei, Red-capped Forest Warbler Orthotomus metopias, Spot-throat Modulatrix stictigula, Amani Sunbird, Banded Green Sunbird, Moreau's Sunbird, Kenrick's Starling Poeoptera kenricki and Usambara Weaver). New information on the ecology of these species is presented in this paper. It is recommended that the conservation status of East Coast Akalat and Uluguru Violet-backed Sunbird be changed to globally Near-threatened and regionally Near-threatened, respectively. Should further work confirm that the Usambara race of Southern Hyliota deserves specific status it is strongly recommended that it be considered globally Endangered. All other species recorded should retain their current status and continue to be monitored. The Nguus represented a new locality for several species. Sharpe's Akalat, Spot-throat, Red-Capped Forest Warbler, otherwise widely distributed throughout the east Tanzania, were absent from the Nguus."
