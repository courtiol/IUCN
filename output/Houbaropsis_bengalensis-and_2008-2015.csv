Rapid decline of the largest remaining population of Bengal Florican Houbaropsis bengalensis and recommendations for its conservation,"['Packman, CE', 'Showler, DA', 'Collar, NJ', 'Virak, S', 'Mahood, SP', 'Handschuh, M', 'Evans, TD', 'Chamnan, H', 'Dolman, PM']",BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL,10.1017/S0959270913000567,DEC 2014,0,"A census of the Critically Endangered Bengal Florican Houbaropsis bengalensis was conducted between March and May 2012 on and surrounding the Tonle Sap floodplain in Cambodia, which supports the last extant population of the Indochinese subspecies blandini. We found a decline in the number of displaying males of 44-64% since a comparable estimate from the same sites in 2005 to 2007. The estimated population, including five individuals at one previously unsurveyed site, is now 216 (95% CI 156-275) displaying males, plus potential non-displaying males and an unknown number of females. If numbers continue to be lost at a similar rate, it is possible that blandini would become extinct within 10 years. Although the population faces multiple threats, this critical situation has primarily been caused by the recent, rapid conversion of the florican's grassland habitat to intensive, industrial-scale, irrigated rice cultivation. To protect the Bengal Florican from extinction in South East Asia, existing Bengal Florican Conservation Areas (BFCAs) need expansion and improvements, including strengthened legal status by prime ministerial sub-decree and better demarcation, patrolling and management. As priorities, both irrigated rice and scrub encroachment within the BFCAs needs to be reversed, local communities better supported, and land outside the BFCAs monitored and strategically managed for florican conservation. Where possible, further BFCAs need to be established. Land purchase may also be an effective conservation measure; leasing land earmarked for cultivation would be cheaper, but less secure."
Planning agriculture based on landuse responses of threatened semiarid grassland species in India,"['Dutta, S', 'Jhala, Y']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2014.04.026,JUL 2014,0,"Balancing biodiversity conservation and rural food security is a pressing challenge for developing countries, with tropical agro-grasslands facing particularly high human dependence and species' endangerment. We explored the potential influences of agricultural growth and allocation of multiple landuses on the status of two threatened species inhabiting semiarid agro-grasslands of India. Sampling 1 km(2) cells for flagship lesser florican Sypheotides indica and 0.03 ha plots for spiny-tailed lizard Saara hardwickii, we modeled species' abundances with land-cover, vegetation structure, and disturbances using N-mixture (florican) and poisson (lizard) models. Florican abundance responded unimodally to herbaceous biomass (grassland proportion x ground-vegetation height), wherein, numbers peaked at optimally large combinations of grassland proportion (0.5-1) and ground-vegetation height (35-65 cm). Whereas, lizard abundance was positively influenced by grassland occurrence and ground-vegetation < 50 cm cover but negatively influenced by cropland occurrence. Livestock grazing promoted short vegetation over tall vegetation, partially hindering florican but facilitating lizard. Such inter-specific differences in landuse response invoked multi-criteria planning based on surrogates of ecologically distinct species-groups. Fitting our models to simulated landuse scenarios, we demonstrated that managing florican habitats as grassland interspersed with croplands and pastures spared rotationally provided optimal results at low production-level. However, projected agricultural growth would cause considerable declines of florican (>30%) and lizard (>20%) populations. To prevent this, remaining florican occupied agro-grasslands should be secured as Community/Conservation reserves so that further landuse conversions can be legally restricted. Simultaneously, government schemes like food provisioning to small farmers through public distribution system could be harnessed to compensate for production deficit within/adjoining reserves.

Generality of Models that Predict the Distribution of Species: Conservation Activity and Reduction of Model Transferability for a Threatened Bustard,"['Gray, TNE', 'Borey, R', 'Hout, SK', 'Chamnan, H', 'Nigel', 'Collar, J', 'Dolman, PM']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01112.x,APR 2009,14,"Predictive models can help clarify the distribution of poorly known species but should display strong transferability when applied to independent data. Nevertheless, model transferability for threatened tropical species is poorly studied. We built models predicting the incidence of the critically endangered Bengal Florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis) within the Tonle Sap (TLS) floodplain, Cambodia. Separate models were constructed with soil, land-use, and landscape data and species incidence sampled over the entire floodplain (12,000 km(2)) and from the Kompong Thom (KT) province (4000 km(2)). In each case, the probability of Bengal Florican presence within randomly selected 1 x 1 km squares was modeled by binary logistic regression with multimodel inference. We assessed the transferability of the KT model by comparing predictions with observed incidence elsewhere in the floodplain. In terms of standard model-validation statistics, the KT model showed good spatial transferability. Nevertheless, it overpredicted florican presence outside the KT calibration region, classifying 491 km2 as suitable habitat compared with 237 km2 predicted as suitable by the TLS model. This resulted from higher species incidence within the calibration region, probably owing to a program of conservation education and enforcement that has reduced persecution there. Because both research and conservation activity frequently focus on areas with higher density, such effects could be widespread, reducing transferability of predictive distribution models."
"Distribution, status and conservation of the Bengal Florican Houbaropsis bengalensis in Cambodia","['Gray, TNE', 'Collar, NJ', 'Davidson, PJA', 'Dolman, PM', 'Evans, TD', 'Fox, HN', 'Chamnan, H', 'Borey, R', 'Hout, SK', 'Van Zalinge, RN']",BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL,10.1017/S095927090800765X,MAR 2009,5,"The Bengal Florican is a 'Critically Endangered' bustard (Otididae) restricted to India, Nepal and Southern Indochina. Fewer than 500 birds are estimated to remain in the Indian subcontinent, whilst the Indochinese breeding population is primarily restricted to grasslands surrounding the Tonle Sap lake, Cambodia. We conducted the first comprehensive breeding season survey of Bengal Florican within the Tonle Sap region (19,500 km(2)). During 2005/06 and 2006/07 we systematically sampled 1-km squares for territorial males. Bengal Florican were detected within 90 1-km squares at a mean density of 0-34 males km(-2) which, accounting for unequal Survey effort across grassland blocks, provides a mean estimate of 0.2 males km(-2). Based on 2005 habitat extent, the estimated Tonle Sap population is 416 adult males (333-502 +/- 95% CI), more than half of them in Kompong Thorn province. Tonle Sap grasslands are rapidly being lost due to intensification of rice cultivation and, based on satellite images, we document declines of 28% grassland cover within 10 grassland blocks between January 2005 and March 2007. Based on Mean 2005 population densities the remaining grassland may support as few as 294 adult male florican, a decline of 30% since 2005. In response to these habitat declines almost 350 km(2) of grassland have been designated as protected areas, set aside for biodiversity and local livelihoods. Conservation activities in these areas include participatory land-Use zoning, patrols reporting new developments to government officials, awareness-raising and incentive-led nest protection schemes."
SEX-SPECIFIC HABITAT USE BY A LEKKING BUSTARD: CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED BENGAL FLORICAN (HOUBAROPSIS BENGALENSIS) IN AN INTENSIFYING AGROECOSYSTEM,"['Gray, TNE', 'Chamnan, H', 'Collar, NJ', 'Dolman, PM']",AUK,10.1525/auk.2009.08023,JAN 2009,10,"Understanding sexual differences in habitat use is important for effective conservation management, particularly with regard to polygynous species, the sexes of which may differ in their responses to land-use change. We examined sex-specific habitat use in the critically endangered Bengal Florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis), a polygynous bustard whose most important population occurs in traditionally farmed grasslands in the Tonle Sap floodplain, Cambodia. This habitat is undergoing rapid conversion to intensive dry-season rice production. Using radiotelemetry, we compared male and female breeding-season habitat selection and home-range sizes and configurations. The sexes differed in their spatial use of the lek and their ability to utilize anthropogenic habitat features. Both sexes avoided intensive dry-season rice fields. Males selected habitats related to low-intensity human activity, chiefly burned grassland, whereas females selected unburned grassland but also used unburned, uncultivated grassland in dry-season rice head-ponds. These differences reflect the species' breeding system, with males using open areas for display and females selecting cover. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the landscape heterogeneity associated with traditional human activity in maintaining the habitat mosaics necessary for the contrasting breeding-season requirements of male and female Bengal Floricans. Two-thirds of tagged females may have left the lek to nest elsewhere, which suggests that protecting habitat in which males display will not be a sufficient conservation response for such lekking species. Both sexes are detrimentally affected by agricultural intensification within the Tonle Sap, and encouragement of industrial rice production to spare more ""natural"" habitats elsewhere is likely to be counterproductive for this globally threatened flagship species.
