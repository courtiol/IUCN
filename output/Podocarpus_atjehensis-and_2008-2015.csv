New Sections and Species of Podocarpus Based on the Taxonomic Status of P. neriifolius (Podocarpaceae) in Tropical Asia,"['de Laubenfels, DJ']",NOVON,10.3417/2012091,SEP 2015,0,"Material previously treated under Podocarpus neriifolius D. Don (Podocarpaceae) has been examined, with eight new species distinguished as P. hookeri de Laub., P. laminaris de Laub. (included within the newly established Podoccarpus L'Her. ex Pers. sect. Spathoides de Laub.), P. lenticularis de Laub., P. linearis de Laub., P. marginalis de Laub., P. novoguineensis de Laub., P. oblongus de Laub., and P. vanuatuensis de Laub., and two new varieties as P. ledermannii Pilg. var. expansus de Laub. and P. pseudobracteatus de Laub. var. sicaris de Laub. (included within the newly established Podocarpus sect. Bracteati de Laub.). Belonging to Podocarpus sect. Foliolati de Laub., P. neglectus Blume was validly published but long considered a synonym of P. neriifolius and is recognized again as a species, with three species referred to it in new synonymy: P. discolor Blume, P. leptostachyus Blume, and P. thailandensis A. D. Silba & J. A. Silva. Podocarpus idenburgensis N. E. Gray, previously treated as a synonym of P. ledermannii, is also taxonomically recognized. Two other species are newly synonymized as P. crassigemmis de Laub. with P. archboldii N. E. Gray and P. epiphyticus de Laub. & Silba with P. teysmannii Miq. Five varieties are newly synonymized as P. neriifolius var. membranaceaus Wasscher with P. atjehensis (Wasscher) de Laub., P. neriifolius var. linearis Wasscher with P. hookeri, P. neriifolius var. polyanthus Wasscher with P. teysmannii, P. neriifolius var. penibukanensis Silba with P. confertus de Laub., and P. neriifolius var. staintonii Silba with P. hookeri. Two new sections of Podocarpus are established as Podocarpus sect. Bracteati de Laub. and Podocarpus sect. Spathoides. Species circumspections are accordingly revised for the established sections Podocarpus sect. Acuminati de Laub., Podocarpus sect. Foliolati de Laub., Podocarpus sect. Globuli de Laub., Podocarpus sect. Longifoliolati de Laub., and Podocarpus sect. Macrostachyes de Laub."
