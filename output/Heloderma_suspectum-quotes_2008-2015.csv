Embryonic water uptake during pregnancy is stage- and fecundity-dependent in the snake Vipera aspis,"['Lourdais, O', 'Lorioux, S', 'Dupoue, A', 'Wright, C', 'DeNardo, DF']",COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cbpa.2015.07.019,NOV 2015,1,"Water is a crucial resource that can profoundly impact the biology of terrestrial organisms. Early life stages are particularly sensitive to hydric constraints because water uptake is an important component of embryonic development. While amniotic eggs constitute a key innovation to terrestrial life, many vertebrates are viviparous wherein the mother must be the source of water for her developing embryos. Since most viviparous squamates are lecithotrophic (i.e., energy is supplied to the offspring as yolk deposited into pre-ovulated follicles), water is the predominant resource allocated from the mother to the offspring during development. Contrary to energy that can be stored (e.g., as fat reserves), water typically cannot be acquired in advance. Therefore, the embryos' need for water can impose significant constraints on the pregnant female. We detailed water flux during pregnancy in a viviparous snake, the aspic viper (Vipera aspis). We found that embryonic water uptake occurred mostly during the second half of pregnancy a period dominated by somatic growth. We also found that, somewhat unexpectedly, changes in female plasma osmolality were negatively related to fecundity. This latter result suggests that water consumption by the female is especially important for large litter sizes, and thus may suggest an important sensitivity of reproductive females to environmental water availability.

Dehydration and drinking behavior in true sea snakes (Elapidae: Hydrophiinae: Hydrophiini),"['Lillywhite, HB', 'Heatwole, H', 'Sheehy, CM', 'LATICAUDA SPP.']",JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,10.1111/jzo.12239,AUG 2015,0,"Water is an essential resource affecting behavior and the acquisition of energy, especially in environments where water is spatially or temporally restricted or unavailable. Recent investigations have shown that several species of marine snakes dehydrate at sea and are dependent on environmental sources of fresh water to maintain water balance. However, in this context, little is known concerning the majority of 'true' sea snakes (Hydrophiini). We investigated the dehydration and drinking responses of five species of hydrophiin sea snakes collected during the dry season in northern Australia. None of these snakes drank sea water, even when dehydrated. Dehydrated individuals of Hydrophis curtus, H. elegans and H. zweifeli drank fresh water, and the mean threshold levels of dehydration that first elicited drinking were deficits of -26, -29 and -27% of body mass, respectively. Individuals of Aipysurus mosaicus and H. peronii did not drink fresh water when similarly dehydrated. Few snakes that we collected following > 4 months of drought drank fresh water immediately after capture. Hydrophiin species appear to have a high resistance to dehydration, which they evidently tolerate in marine habitats for extended periods during drought. Thirst in these species is significantly less sensitive than in other species, suggesting that marine snakes have variable requirements for drinking fresh water. These data illustrate that sea snakes are characterized by diverse responses to dehydration and likely have different osmoregulatory strategies for survival, with implications for better understanding the evolutionary success of secondarily marine vertebrates and their potential responses to future changes in tropical precipitation."
Characterization of the gila monster (Heloderma suspectum suspectum) venom proteome.,"['Sanggaard, Kristian W', 'Dyrlund, Thomas F', 'Thomsen, Line R', 'Nielsen, Tania A', 'Brondum, Lars', 'Wang, Tobias', 'Thogersen, Ida B', 'Enghild, Jan J']",Data in brief,10.1016/j.dib.2015.01.007,2015-Jun,0,"The data presented here is related to the research article entitled ""Characterization of the gila monster (Heloderma suspectum suspectum) venom proteome"" by Sanggaard et al. in Journal of Proteomics [1]. The gila monster venom was collected, analyzed by 2D-gel electrophoresis and after Coomassie-Brilliant Blue staining the major spots were excised, subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Subsequently, the venom proteins were identified based on de novo sequencing and homology searching. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange (dataset identifier PXD0001343), and in the present article we present an overview of the identified proteins. Protein identification failed for three of the selected spots, with the method described above. Instead, an iterative process, based on de novo sequencing, was employed."
"Early Pleistocene (Blancan) Helodermatid Lizard from Arizona, USA","['Mead, JI', 'Holte, S', 'White, RS', 'McCord, R', 'XENOSAURUS']",JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY,10.1670/13-222,JUN 2015,0,"Two cranial osteoderms and a maxilla assigned to Heloderma suspectum (Squamata, Helodermatidae) were recovered from the 111 Ranch fossil locality, San Simon Valley, Graham County, southeastern Arizona. A minimum age of the deposits and fossils is approximately 2.7-2.4 million years ago, latest Blancan Land Mammal Age, spanning the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary. The presence of a pronounced deep venom grove and a tooth count of eight indicate that the maxilla belongs to Heloderma and not the closely related and extinct Lowesaurus or Eurheloderma. The highly reduced nasolacrimal fossa and the shortened projection of the maxillary lappet on the fossil agree with the condition in H. suspectum and not in Heloderma horridum. During this transition time, the locality was a mosaic grassland-woodland ecosystem with open water and riparian niches occupied with grazing and browsing mammals."
Ultrastructural features of skin pigmentation in the lizard Heloderma suspectum with emphasis on xanto-melanophores,"['Alibardi, L']",ACTA ZOOLOGICA,10.1111/azo.12062,APR 2015,0,"The morphological origin of the dark and pink-orange areas in the skin of the venomous lizard Heloderma suspectum is not known. Histology and electron microscopy show that dark-grey areas of the skin derived from dermal chromatophores localized in specific areas present underneath the epidermis. A dynamic chromatophoric unit in the dermis is absent. In the darkest areas of the skin, the accumulation of melanosomes in cells of the beta-layer contributes to increase the black intensity. In the orange-pink areas, the superficial dermis contains xantophores storing numerous carotenoid vesicles, rare or absent lamellated pterinosomes and a variable number of melanosomes. These xanto-melanophores predominate over the remaining chromatophores and form a continuous stratum underneath the epidermis. Beneath this lipoid-rich stratum, iridophores are infrequent and do not form a continuous layer in the dermis. In the paler areas of the skin, melanophores are sparse in both superficial and deeper part of the dermis where irregularly oriented bundles of collagen fibrils are present. The prevalent xanto-melanophores localized in the pink-orange areas of the skin contribute to an effective sunlight protection in desert conditions in addition to the darker regions occupied by melanophores."
Characterization of the gila monster (Heloderma suspectum suspectum) venom proteome,"['Sanggaard, KW', 'Dyrlund, TF', 'Thomsen, LR', 'Nielsen, TA', 'Brondum, L', 'Wang, T', 'Thogersen, IB', 'Enghild, JJ']",JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS,10.1016/j.jprot.2015.01.004,MAR 18 2015,0,"The archetypical venomous lizard species are the helodermatids, the gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum) and the beaded lizards (Heloderma horridum). In the present study, the gila monster venom proteome was characterized using 2D-gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry-based de novo peptide sequencing followed by protein identification based on sequence homology. A total of 39 different proteins were identified out of the 58 selected spots that represent the major constituents of venom. Of these proteins, 19 have not previously been identified in helodermatid venom. The data showed that helodermatid venom is complex and that this complexity is caused by genetic isoforms and post-translational modifications including proteolytic processing. In addition, the venom proteome analysis revealed that the major constituents of the gila monster venom are kallikrein-like serine proteinases (EC 3.4.21) and phospholipase A(2) (type III) enzymes (EC 3.1.1.4). A neuroendocrine convertase 1 homolog that most likely converts the proforms of the previously identified bioactive exendins into the mature and active forms was identified suggesting that these peptide toxins are secreted as proforms that are activated by proteolytic cleavage following secretion as opposed to being activated intracellularly. The presented global protein identification-analysis provides the first overview of the helodermatid venom composition.

Biological significance

The helodermatid lizards are the classical venomous lizards, and the pharmacological potential of the venom from these species has been known for years; best illustrated by the identification of exendin-4, which is now used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Despite the potential, no global analyses of the protein components in the venom exist. A hindrance is the lack of a genome sequence because it prevents protein identification using a conventional approach where MS data are searched against predicted protein sequences based on the genome sequence. However, in the recent years the development of software tools for de novo sequencing and homology searches have improved significantly facilitating the first global analysis of the major protein components of helodermatid venom presented in this study. We have used a 2D-gel approach and determined the protein components in the 58 major spots resulting in the identification of 39 unique proteins. Of these, 19 have not previously been identified in helodermatid venom. The analysis provides results with impact on our understanding of the function and evolution of venom proteins, and serves as a basis for further unraveling of the pharmaceutical potential of the venom components.

Intergenerational trade-off for water may induce a mother-offspring conflict in favour of embryos in a viviparous snake,"['Dupoue, A', 'Brischoux, F', 'Angelier, F', 'DeNardo, DF', 'Wright, CD', 'Lourdais, O']",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,10.1111/1365-2435.12349,MAR 2015,3,"Parent-offspring conflicts are likely to occur when resources are limiting either at pre- or post-natal stages due to intergenerational trade-offs over resources. Current theory posits that such conflicts may influence the evolution of parental allocation as well as reproductive modes. While energy allocation to the offspring has received considerable attention, the distribution of water - another potentially limited vital resource to both the mother and offspring - and the resulting outcomes remain grossly understudied. Here, we explored the intergenerational trade-off related to water resources in the viviparous aspic viper (Vipera aspis) by examining the effects of water deprivation on female physiology (body mass, haematocrit and osmolality), water transfer to developing embryos and reproductive performance. As a result of water deprivation, females became dehydrated, with the effects more pronounced in pregnant compared to nonreproductive females. Among pregnant females, the impacts of water deprivation on water balance were correlated with fecundity. In contrast, water deprivation had no effect on water transfer to the offspring or on reproductive performance. Our results demonstrate that, under water-constraining conditions, female water balance is compromised in favour of the developing embryos, highlighting a significant intergenerational trade-off for water. Although ectothermic reptiles are particularly tolerant in water balance perturbations, our results suggest that, like energy, water can be a conflicting resource between mother and offspring. Parent-offspring conflict over water should therefore be further investigated to better understand reproductive modes and reproductive trade-offs in terrestrial organisms."
Problems with mitigation translocation of herpetofauna,"['Sullivan, BK', 'Nowak, EM', 'Kwiatkowski, MA']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/cobi.12336,FEB 2015,3,"Mitigation translocation of nuisance animals is a commonly used management practice aimed at resolution of human-animal conflict by removal and release of an individual animal. Long considered a reasonable undertaking, especially by the general public, it is now known that translocated subjects are negatively affected by the practice. Mitigation translocation is typically undertaken with individual adult organisms and has a much lower success rate than the more widely practiced conservation translocation of threatened and endangered species. Nonetheless, the public and many conservation practitioners believe that because population-level conservation translocations have been successful that mitigation translocation can be satisfactorily applied to a wide variety of human-wildlife conflict situations. We reviewed mitigation translocations of reptiles, including our own work with 3 long-lived species (Gila monsters [Heloderma suspectum], Sonoran desert tortoises [Gopherus morafkai], and western diamond-backed rattlesnakes [Crotalus atrox]). Overall, mitigation translocation had a low success rate when judged either by effects on individuals (in all studies reviewed they exhibited increased movement or increased mortality) or by the success of the resolution of the human-animal conflict (translocated individuals often returned to the capture site). Careful planning and identification of knowledge gaps are critical to increasing success rates in mitigation translocations in the face of increasing pressure to find solutions for species threatened by diverse anthropogenic factors, including climate change and exurban and energy development. Problemas con la Mitigacion por Traslocacion de Herpetofauna

Resumen La mitigacion de animales molestos por traslocacion comunmente se usa como una practica de manejo enfocada a la resolucion del conflicto humano-animal por remocion y liberacion de un animal. Considerada durante mucho tiempo un proyecto razonable, especialmente por el publico en general, ahora se sabe que los sujetos traslocados se ven afectados negativamente por la practica. La mitigacion por traslocacion se emprende tipicamente con organismos adultos y tiene una tasa de exito mucho mas baja que la ampliamente practicada traslocacion para la conservacion de especies amenazadas y en peligro. Sin embargo, el publico y muchos practicantes de la conservacion creen que como las traslocaciones de conservacion a nivel de poblacion han sido exitosas entonces la mitigacion por traslocacion puede aplicarse satisfactoriamente a una amplia variedad de situaciones de conflicto humano-vida silvestre. Revisamos la mitigacion de reptiles por traslocacion, incluido nuestro propio trabajo con tres especies de larga vida: monstruo de Gila (Heloderma suspectum), tortugas del desierto de Sonora (Gopherus morafkai) y la serpiente de cascabel (Crotalus atrox). En general, la mitigacion por traslocacion tuvo una baja tasa de exito al ser juzgada por los efectos sobre los individuos (en todos los estudios revisados exhibieron incremento en movimiento y mortalidad) o por el exito de la resolucion de los conflictos humano-animal (los individuos traslocados a menudo regresaban al sitio de captura). La planeacion cuidadosa y la identificacion de los vacios de conocimiento son criticos para incrementar las tasas de exito en mitigacion por traslocacion de cara a una presion creciente para encontrar soluciones para las especies amenazadas por diversos factores antropogenicos, incluidos el cambio climatico y el desarrollo de energia exurbano."
Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) envenomation: Descriptive analysis of calls to United States Poison Centers with focus on Arizona cases,"['French, R', 'Brooks, D', 'Ruha, AM', 'Shirazi, F', 'Chase, P', 'Boesen, K', 'Walter, F']",CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY,10.3109/15563650.2014.988791,JAN 2015,0,"Background. The Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) is a venomous lizard native to the deserts of southwestern United States (US) and northern Mexico. The purpose of this study was to describe human exposures to Gila monsters reported to US poison control centers (PCCs) with a focus on Arizona cases. Methods. The American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS) was used to access and retrospectively review all calls to US PCCs, concerning Gila monsters between January 1, 2000 and October 31, 2011. In addition, detailed records from the two Arizona PCCs were reviewed for the same time period. Results. A total of 319 calls regarding Gila monsters were identified in the NPDS. Of these, 105 (33%) were human exposures; most (79%) occurred in males. A total of 71 (68%) of these 105 cases were referred to a health care facility (HCF); 30 (29%) were managed on-site. Of the 71 HCF referrals, 36 (51%) were discharged home and 17 (24%) were admitted. Most (65%) admissions were to an intensive care unit (ICU). Arizona's PCCs received 70 unique reports of Gila monster bite. Most (77%) of the bites in Arizona involved an upper extremity. Eight (11%) involved patients under the age of 18 years. Eleven (16%) Arizona cases were work-related. Twenty-eight (40%) of the 70 bites in Arizona were evaluated in a HCF, but not admitted. Eleven (16%) were admitted, of which five were to an ICU. Six patients had edema of airway structures; three required emergent airway management, one by cricothyrotomy. There were no deaths. Conclusion. Gila monster bites are uncommon. Many cases did not require hospitalization. Edema of airway structures is an infrequent, but life-threatening complication."
Molecular Characterization of a Lizard Adenovirus Reveals the First Atadenovirus with Two Fiber Genes and the First Adenovirus with Either One Short or Three Long Fibers per Penton,"['Penzes, JJ', 'Menendez-Conejero, R', 'Condezo, GN', 'Ball, I', 'Papp, T', 'Doszpoly, A', 'Paradela, A', 'Perez-Berna, AJ', 'Lopez-Sanz, M', 'Nguyen, TH', 'van Raaij, MJ', 'Marschang, RE', 'Harrach, B', 'Benko, M', 'San Martin, C']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.00306-14,OCT 2014,5,"Although adenoviruses (AdVs) have been found in a wide variety of reptiles, including numerous squamate species, turtles, and crocodiles, the number of reptilian adenovirus isolates is still scarce. The only fully sequenced reptilian adenovirus, snake adenovirus 1 (SnAdV-1), belongs to the Atadenovirus genus. Recently, two new atadenoviruses were isolated from a captive Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) and Mexican beaded lizards (Heloderma horridum). Here we report the full genomic and proteomic characterization of the latter, designated lizard adenovirus 2 (LAdV-2). The double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome of LAdV-2 is 32,965 bp long, with an average G+C content of 44.16%. The overall arrangement and gene content of the LAdV-2 genome were largely concordant with those in other atadenoviruses, except for four novel open reading frames (ORFs) at the right end of the genome. Phylogeny reconstructions and plesiomorphic traits shared with SnAdV-1 further supported the assignment of LAdV-2 to the Atadenovirus genus. Surprisingly, two fiber genes were found for the first time in an atadenovirus. After optimizing the production of LAdV-2 in cell culture, we determined the protein compositions of the virions. The two fiber genes produce two fiber proteins of different sizes that are incorporated into the viral particles. Interestingly, the two different fiber proteins assemble as either one short or three long fiber projections per vertex. Stoichiometry estimations indicate that the long fiber triplet is present at only one or two vertices per virion. Neither triple fibers nor a mixed number of fibers per vertex had previously been reported for adenoviruses or any other virus.

IMPORTANCE

Here we show that a lizard adenovirus, LAdV-2, has a penton architecture never observed before. LAdV-2 expresses two fiber proteins-one short and one long. In the virion, most vertices have one short fiber, but a few of them have three long fibers attached to the same penton base. This observation raises new intriguing questions on virus structure. How can the triple fiber attach to a pentameric vertex? What determines the number and location of each vertex type in the icosahedral particle? Since fibers are responsible for primary attachment to the host, this novel architecture also suggests a novel mode of cell entry for LAdV-2. Adenoviruses have a recognized potential in nanobiomedicine, but only a few of the more than 200 types found so far in nature have been characterized in detail. Exploring the taxonomic wealth of adenoviruses should improve our chances to successfully use them as therapeutic tools."
Life in the Lizard Slow Lane: Gila Monsters Have Low Rates of Energy Use and Water Flux,"['Gienger, CM', 'Tracy, CR', 'Nagy, KA']",COPEIA,10.1643/CP-13-086,SEP 2014,1,"Field metabolic rates (FMR) and water influx rates (WIR) were measured in Gila Monsters (Heloderma suspectum) in the Mojave Desert of southern Nevada. Gila Monsters had rates of energy use that were less than half of those expected for lizards of their size, including species that live in arid habitats. Free-living Gila Monsters also had comparatively low water flux rates. The annual energy requirements of adult Gila Monsters averaged approximately 3,766 kJ, with two-thirds of the total (2,533 kJ) allocated to activity while above ground, and one-third to resting metabolism (1,233 kJ; mostly while below ground). Unusually low rates of resting metabolism caused relative costs of activity to be high: compared to other lizards, Gila Monsters have among the highest proportional use of energy for activity, relative to total energy use. The average annual water expenditure of adults was approximately 775 mL, and lizards achieved positive mass balance by drinking rain water during the late summer monsoon season. Drinking may be critical in meeting annual water requirements. FMR and WIR differed between seasons but were both highest in early summer (mid-May through June), coinciding with the peak of foraging and breeding activities. Levels of above-ground activity significantly influenced both FMR and WIR, whereas body temperature while burrowed influenced only WIR, and body mass (over the range of 270 to 420 g) did not significantly influence either whole-animal FMR or WIR."

We uncovered homomorphic ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes in the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) with a highly heterochromatic W chromosome. The sex chromosomes are morphologically similar to the ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes of monitor lizards (Varanidae).

Dehydration and Drinking Behavior of the Marine File Snake Acrochordus granulatus,"['Lillywhite, HB', 'Heatwole, H', 'Sheehy, CM']",PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY,10.1086/673375,JAN 1 2014,3,"Dehydration and drinking behaviors were investigated in the little file snake (Acrochordus granulatus) collected from marine populations in the Philippines and in Australia. File snakes dehydrate in seawater and do not drink seawater when dehydrated in air and offered seawater to drink. Dehydrated file snakes drink freshwater, and the threshold of dehydration for first drinking response is a deficit of -7.4% +/- 2.73% (mean +/- SD) of original body mass. The thirst mechanism in this species is more sensitive than that recently studied in sea snakes. The volume of water ingested increases with increasing dehydration. Mean plasma osmolality was 278.89 +/- 33.17 mMol/kg, mean hematocrit was 59% +/- 5.45%, and both decreased in snakes that drank freshwater following acclimation in seawater. Snakes always drank freshwater at the water''s surface, testing water with tongue flicks between each swallowing of water. Some snakes ingested large volumes of freshwater, approaching 50% of body mass. Visual observations and measurements of osmolality in plasma and stomach fluids suggest that water is taken up from the gut and dilutes body fluids slowly over the course of 48 h or longer. Eighty percent of snakes that were collected during the dry season (following >4 mo of drought) in Australia drank freshwater immediately following their capture, indicating that snakes were dehydrated in their marine environment even when known to have been feeding at the time. Snakes kept in seawater maintained a higher state of body condition when freshwater was periodically available. These results support a growing conclusion that diverse taxa of marine snakes require environmental sources of freshwater to maintain water balance, contrary to earlier belief. Identifying the freshwater requirements of secondarily marine vertebrates is important for better understanding how they maintain water balance in marine habitats, especially with respect to conservation in changing environments."

Connectivity maps for biosimilar drug discovery in venoms: The case of Gila Monster Venom and the anti-diabetes drug Byetta (R),"['Aramadhaka, LR', 'Prorock, A', 'Dragulev, B', 'Bao, YD', 'Fox, JW']",TOXICON,10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.03.018,JUL 2013,6,"Like most natural product libraries animal venoms have long been recognized as Potentially rich source of biologically active molecules with the potential to be mined for the discovery of drugs, drug leads and/or biosimilars. In this work we demonstrate as a proof of concept a novel approach to explore venoms for potential biosimilarity to other drugs based on their ability to alter the transcriptomes of test cell lines followed by informatic searches and Connectivity Mapping to match the action of the venom on the cell gene expression to that of other drugs in the Connectivity Map (C-Map) database. As our test animal venom we chose Heloderma suspectum venom (Gila monster) since exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, isolated from the venom is currently on the market to treat type 2 diabetes. The action of Byetta (R) (exentide, synthetic exendin-4), was also used in transcriptome studies. Analysis of transcriptomes from cells treated with the venom or the drug showed similarities as well as differences. The former case was primarily attributed to the fact that Gila monster venom likely contains a variety of biologically active molecules that could alter the MCF7 cell transcriptome compared to that of the single perturbant Byetta (R). Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software, insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling was identified in the category of ""Top Canonical Pathways"" for both the venom and Byetta (R). In the category of ""Top Molecules"" up-regulated, both venom and Byetta (R) shared IL-8, cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor 3 (ATF-3), neuron-derived orphan receptor 1 (NR4A3), dexamethasone-induced Ras-related protein 1 (RASD1) and early growth response protein 1, (EGR-1) all with potential relevance in diabetes. Using Connectivity Mapping, Gila monster venom showed positive correlation with 1732 instances and negative correlation with 793 instances in the Connectivity database whereas Byetta (R) showed positive correlation with 1692 instances and negative correlation with 868 instances. Interestingly, the Gila monster venom and Byetta (R) both showed positive correlation with the anti-diabetic drugs troglitazone, of the thiazolidinedione class, and metformin, of the biguanide class, although Byetta (R) as a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist functions in a different manner than either of these two classes of anti-diabetic drugs. In summary, despite the fact that Gila monster venom contains a mixture of biologically active molecules, similarities in terms of perturbation of gene expression profiles on MCF7 cells were observed between the venom and the drug Byetta (R). Furthermore, using Connectivity Mapping the Gila monster venom was demonstrated to have nodes of positive correlation to several anti-diabetic drugs two of which were the same as observed with Byetta. Therefore, this study suggests that by using this approach novel drug activities heretofore unconsidered may be discovered in venoms using informatic tools and Connectivity Mapping.

As researchers approached the nests, female desert tortoises moved to the entrance of their burrows and positioned themselves sideways, directly over their nests. One female stretched her limbs outward and wedged herself into the burrow (her plastron directly above the nest). Guarding of nests is rarely observed in Agassiz's desert tortoise but can occur as a result of attempted predation on eggs by Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum) or in direct response to the perceived threat posed by researchers. This is the first report of nest-guarding for G. agassizii in the Sonoran Desert ecosystem of California."
The effect of hydration state and energy balance on innate immunity of a desert reptile,"['Moeller, KT', 'Butler, MW', 'DeNardo, DF']",FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY,10.1186/1742-9994-10-23,MAY 4 2013,3,"Introduction: Immune function is a vital physiological process that is often suppressed during times of resource scarcity due to investments in other physiological systems. While energy is the typical currency that has been examined in such trade-offs, limitations of other resources may similarly lead to trade-offs that affect immune function. Specifically, water is a critical resource with profound implications for organismal ecology, yet its availability can fluctuate at local, regional, and even global levels. Despite this, the effect of osmotic state on immune function has received little attention.

Results: Using agglutination and lysis assays as measures of an organism's plasma concentration of natural antibodies and capacity for foreign cell destruction, respectively, we tested the independent effects of osmotic state, digestive state, and energy balance on innate immune function in free-ranging and laboratory populations of the Gila monster, Heloderma suspectum. This desert-dwelling lizard experiences dehydration and energy resource fluctuations on a seasonal basis. Dehydration was expected to decrease innate immune function, yet we found that dehydration increased lysis and agglutination abilities in both lab and field studies, a relationship that was not simply an effect of an increased concentration of immune molecules. Laboratory-based differences in digestive state were not associated with lysis or agglutination metrics, although in our field population, a loss of fat stores was correlated with an increase in lysis.

Conclusions: Depending on the life history of an organism, osmotic state may have a greater influence on immune function than energy availability. Thus, consideration of osmotic state as a factor influencing immune function will likely improve our understanding of ecoimmunology and the disease dynamics of a wide range of species."
"Meal consumption is ineffective at maintaining or correcting water balance in a desert lizard, Heloderma suspectum
","['Wright, CD', 'Jackson, ML', 'DeNardo, DF']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.080895,APR 2013,8,"Many xeric organisms maintain water balance by relying on dietary and metabolic water rather than free water, even when free water may be available. For such organisms, hydric state may influence foraging decisions, since meal consumption is meeting both energy and water demands. To understand foraging decisions it is vital to understand the role of dietary water in maintaining water balance. We investigated whether meal consumption was sufficient to maintain water balance in captive Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum) at varying levels of dehydration. Gila monsters could not maintain water balance over long time scales through meal consumption alone. Animals fed a single meal took no longer to dehydrate than controls when both groups were deprived of free water. Additionally, meal consumption imparts an acute short-term hydric cost regardless of hydration state. Meal consumption typically resulted in a significant elevation in osmolality at 6 h post-feeding, and plasma osmolality never fell below pre-feeding levels despite high water content (similar to 70%) of meals. These results failed to support our hypothesis that dietary water is valuable to Gila monsters during seasonal drought. When considered in conjunction with previous research, these results demonstrate that Gila monsters, unlike many xeric species, are heavily reliant on seasonal rainfall and the resulting free-standing water to maintain water balance."

Lizards in a laboratory thermal gradient were fed rodent meals of three different sizes (5, 10, or 20% of body mass), or sham fed (meal of 0% body mass), and T(b)s were recorded for three days before feeding and seven days after feeding. Gila monsters selected a mean T-b of 25.2 degrees C while fasting (set-point range 23.6-27.1), and increased T(b)s after feeding. The magnitude and duration of post-prandial T-b increases are positively related to meal size, and Gila monsters selected mean T(b)s up to 3.0 degrees C higher and maintain elevated T(b)s for 3-6 days after feeding. Selection of T-b does not appear to differ between day and night time periods, and because the lizards are both diurnal and nocturnal (at different times of year), photoperiod may not be an important influence on T-b selection.

Development and Evaluation of F-18-TTCO-Cys(40)-Exendin-4: A PET Probe for Imaging Transplanted Islets,"['Wu, ZH', 'Liu, SL', 'Hassink, M', 'Nair, I', 'Park, R', 'Li, L', 'Todorov, I', 'Fox, JM', 'Li, ZB', 'Shively, JE', 'Conti, PS', 'Kandeel, F']",JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE,10.2967/jnumed.112.109694,FEB 1 2013,24,"Because islet transplantation has become a promising treatment option for patients with type 1 diabetes, a noninvasive imaging method is greatly needed to monitor these islets over time. Here, we developed an F-18-labeled exendin-4 in high specific activity for islet imaging by targeting the glucagonlike peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Methods: Tetrazine ligation was used to radiolabel exendin-4 with F-18. The receptor binding of F-19/18-tetrazine trans-cyclooctene (TTCO)-Cys(40)-exendin-4 was evaluated in vitro with INS-1 cell and in vivo on INS-1 tumor (GLP-1R positive) and islet transplantation models. Results: F-18-TTCO-Cys(40)-exendin-4 was obtained in high specific activity and could specifically bind to GLP-1R in vitro and in vivo. Unlike the radiometal-labeled exendin-4, F-18-TTCO-Cys(40)-exendin-4 has much lower kidney uptake. F-18-TTCO-Cys(40)-exendin-4 demonstrated its great potential for transplanted islet imaging: the liver uptake value derived from small-animal PET images correlated well with the transplanted beta-cell mass determined by immunostaining. Autoradiography showed that the localizations of radioactive signal indeed corresponded to the distribution of islet grafts in the liver of islet-transplanted mice. Conclusion: F-18-TTCO-Cys(40)-exendin-4 demonstrated specific binding to GLP-1R. This PET probe provides a method to noninvasively image intraportally transplanted islets."
Ultrastructural and immunocytochemical features of the epidermis of the lizard Heloderma suspectum indicate richness in lipids and lack of a specialized shedding complex,"['Alibardi, L', 'DeNardo, DF', 'LEPIDOSAURIA']",ACTA ZOOLOGICA,10.1111/j.1463-6395.2011.00528.x,JAN 2013,1,"Alibardi, L. and DeNardo, D.F. 2011. Ultrastructural and immunocytochemical features of the epidermis of the lizard Heloderma suspectum indicate richness in lipids and lack of a specialized shedding complex. Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 00: 19. Abstract The epidermis of the venomous lizard Heloderma suspectum has been studied for detecting generalized and desert adaptations. A thick and non-completely syncytial beta-keratin layer is followed by 6090 layers of mesos-cells. Non-lamellated or sparse lamellated lipid material is seen among mesos-cells where lipids form the main barrier against water loss. The alpha-layer is made of interlocking cells with irregular perimeter that are connected through desmosomal remnants. Immunocytochemistry shows that beta-keratin is present in beta-cells, disappears in mesos-cells but is diffuse in alpha-cells. Alpha-keratin is seen in mesos-cells but lowers in alpha-cells where alpha-keratin probably mixes with beta-keratin. Although the sequence of layers formed during the renewal stage of the epidermis was not available, a specialized shedding layer with an outer oberhautchen faced to an inner clear layer appears absent in this species. This condition suggests that shedding occurs at the boundary between the outer (old) alpha-layer and the inner (new) beta-layer formed underneath the alpha-layer. The thick mesos layer is likely an efficient adaptation to limit water loss in desert conditions while the poorly specialized shedding complex may suggest a primitive stage in the evolution of the shedding layer in this lizard or a special adaptation to water shortage."
Structural and Molecular Diversification of the Anguimorpha Lizard Mandibular Venom Gland System in the Arboreal Species Abronia graminea,"['Koludarov, I', 'Sunagar, K', 'Undheim, EAB', 'Jackson, TNW', 'Ruder, T', 'Whitehead, D', 'Saucedo, AC', 'Mora, GR', 'Alagon, AC', 'King, G', 'Antunes, A', 'Fry, BG']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-012-9529-9,DEC 2012,8,"In the past, toxinological research on reptiles has focused principally on clinically important species. As a result, our understanding of the evolution of the reptile venom system is limited. Here, for the first time, we describe the structural and molecular evolutionary features of the mandibular toxin-secreting gland of Abronia graminea, a representative of one of the poorly known and entirely arboreal lineages of anguimorph lizards. We show that the mandibular gland is robust and serous, characters consistent with those expected of a toxin-secreting gland in active use. A wide array of transcripts were recovered that were homologous to those encoded by the indisputably venomous helodermatid lizards. We show that some of these toxin transcripts are evolving under active selection and show evidence of rapid diversification. Helokinestatin peptides in particular are revealed to have accumulated residues that have undergone episodic diversifying selections. Conversely, the natriuretic peptides have evolved under tremendous evolutionary constraints despite being encoded in tandem with helokinestatins by the same gene precursor. Of particular note is the sequencing for the first time of kunitz peptides from a lizard toxin-secreting gland. Not only are kunitz peptides shown to be an ancestral toxicoferan toxin, the ancestral state of this peptide is revealed to be a dual domain encoding precursor. This research provides insight into the evolutionary history of the ancient toxicoferan reptile venom system. In addition, it shows that even 'clinically irrelevant' species can be a rich source of novel venom components, worthy of investigation for drug design and biomedical research."

Flexibility in locomotor-feeding integration during prey capture in varanid lizards: effects of prey size and velocity,"['Montuelle, SJ', 'Herrel, A', 'Libourel, PA', 'Daillie, S', 'Bels, VL', 'GERRHOSAURUS-MAJOR']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.072074,NOV 2012,3,"Feeding movements are adjusted in response to food properties, and this flexibility is essential for omnivorous predators as food properties vary routinely. In most lizards, prey capture is no longer considered to solely rely on the movements of the feeding structures (jaws, hyolingual apparatus) but instead is understood to require the integration of the feeding system with the locomotor system (i.e. coordination of movements). Here, we investigated flexibility in the coordination pattern between jaw, neck and forelimb movements in omnivorous varanid lizards feeding on four prey types varying in length and mobility: grasshoppers, live newborn mice, adult mice and dead adult mice. We tested for bivariate correlations between 3D locomotor and feeding kinematics, and compared the jaw-neck-forelimb coordination patterns across prey types. Our results reveal that locomotor-feeding integration is essential for the capture of evasive prey, and that different jaw-neck-forelimb coordination patterns are used to capture different prey types. Jaw-neck-forelimb coordination is indeed significantly altered by the length and speed of the prey, indicating that a similar coordination pattern can be finely tuned in response to prey stimuli. These results suggest feed-forward as well as feed-back modulation of the control of locomotor-feeding integration. As varanids are considered to be specialized in the capture of evasive prey (although they retain their ability to feed on a wide variety of prey items), flexibility in locomotor-feeding integration in response to prey mobility is proposed to be a key component in their dietary specialization."
Oleic acid and glucose regulate glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor expression in a rat pancreatic ductal cell line,"['Zhang, LW', 'Tobin, GAM', 'Rouse, RL']",TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY,10.1016/j.taap.2012.08.008,OCT 15 2012,1,"The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) plays a critical role in glucose metabolism and has become an important target for a growing class of drugs designed to treat type 2 diabetes.

A high caloric, high fat diet is a risk factor for impaired glucose tolerance and type-2 diabetes. An in vitro Oleic acid (OA) model was used to investigate the effect of Ex4 in a high calorie, high fat environment. At 0.1 and 0.4 mM, OA mildly decreased the proliferation of all pancreatic cell types. Ex4 did not potentiate the inhibitory effect of OA on cell proliferation. Akt phosphorylation in response to Ex4 was diminished in OA-treated ductal cells. GLP1R protein detected by western blot was time and concentration dependently decreased after glucose stimulation in OA-treated ductal cells. In ductal cells, OA treatment altered the intracellular localization of GLP1R and its co-localization with early endosome and recycling endosomes. Chloroquine (lysosomal inhibitor), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (reactive oxygen species scavenger) and wortmannin (a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor), fully or partially, rescued GLP1R protein in OA-pretreated, glucose-stimulated ductal cells. The impact of altered regulation on phenotype/function is presently unknown. However, these data suggest that GLP1R regulation in ductal cells can be altered by a high fat, high calorie environment.

First published July 25, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00259.2012.-Activation of the glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) are new antidiabetic strategies. The GLP-1R and DPP-4 are also expressed in the renal proximal tubular brush border, where they may regulate Na+ reabsorption. Exendin-4 (EX4) is a naturally occurring antidiabetic polypeptide (from the saliva of the lizard Heloderma suspectum) and GLP-1R agonist; however, part of its nonglucoregulatory effects are through GLP-1R-independent mechanisms. DPP-4 cleaves and inactivates GLP-1; thus the natriuretic effect of DPP-4 inhibition may be mediated by the GLP-1R. We report that parenteral application of EX4 in wild-type mice induced a diuresis and natriuresis associated with increases in glomerular filtration rate, fractional urinary fluid and Na+ excretion, and renal membrane expression of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 phosphorylated at S552 and S605, established consensus sites for cAMP-dependent PKA. These effects were absent in mice lacking the GLP-1R and independent of adenylyl cyclase 6. In comparison, parenteral application of the DPP-4 inhibitor alogliptin reduced plasma DPP-4 activity by 95% and induced a diuresis and natriuresis independent of the presence of the GLP-1R or changes in phosphorylated NHE3. The inhibitory effect on renal fluid and Na+ reabsorption of EX4, but not alogliptin, was preserved in diabetic db/db mice and associated with a modest reduction in blood pressure. These results reveal mechanistic differences in how EX4 vs. DPP-4 inhibition induces diuresis and natriuresis under normal states, with preservation of GLP-1R-mediated, but not DPP-4 inhibitor-dependent, natriuretic mechanisms in a mouse model of obese type 2 diabetes."

First published May 15, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00182.2012.-A possible association between glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs and incidences of pancreatitis has been suggested based on clinical studies. In male and female diabetic Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, we investigated the effects of continuous administration of liraglutide and exenatide on biochemical [lipase, pancreatic amylase (P-amylase)] and histopathological markers of pancreatitis. Male and female ZDF rats were dosed for 13 wk with liraglutide (0.4 or 1.0 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) sc once daily) or exenatide (0.25 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) sc, Alzet osmotic minipumps). P-amylase and lipase plasma activity were measured, and an extended histopathological and stereological (specific cell mass and proliferation rate) evaluation of the exocrine and the endocrine pancreas was performed. Expectedly, liraglutide and exenatide lowered blood glucose and Hb A(1c) in male and female ZDF rats, whereas beta-cell mass and proliferation rate were increased with greatly improved blood glucose control. Whereas neither analog affected lipase activity, small increases in P-amylase activity were observed in animals treated with liraglutide and exenatide. However, concurrent or permanent increases in lipase and P-amylase activity were never observed. Triglycerides were lowered by both GLP-1 analogs. The qualitative histopathological findings did not reveal adverse effects of liraglutide. The findings were mainly minimal in severity and focal in distribution. Similarly, the quantitative stereological analyses revealed no effects of liraglutide or exenatide on overall pancreas weight or exocrine and duct cell mass or proliferation. The present study demonstrates that, in overtly diabetic male and female ZDF rats, prolonged exposure to GLP-1 receptor agonists does not affect biochemical or histopathological markers of pancreatitis, and whereas both exenatide and liraglutide increase beta-cell mass, they have no effect on the exocrine pancreas. However, clinical outcome studies and studies using primate tissues and/or studies in nonhuman primates are needed to further assess human risk."

The development of Byetta (exenatide) from the venom of the Gila monster as an anti-diabetic agent,"['Furman, BL']",TOXICON,10.1016/j.toxicon.2010.12.016,MAR 15 2012,19,"The development of Byetta (synthetic exendin-4; exenatide) as a treatment of diabetes arose from two, parallel lines of investigation. The development of the 'incretin concept' which hypothesised that hormones from the gut contributed to the insulin secretion in response to meals, led to the identification of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) as an important 'incretin' hormone. GLP-1 not only increases insulin secretion but increases beta-cell proliferation and survival, suppresses glucagon secretion, delays gastric emptying and suppresses appetite, all of these actions contributing to a potential anti-diabetic effect. However, GLP-1 has a very short half due to its rapid breakdown by dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ectopeptidases. A systematic investigation of the composition and activity of venom from the Gila monster, Heloderma suspectum, led to the isolation of a 39-amino acid peptide, designated exendin-4, showing 53% structural homology with GLP-1(7-36). Exendin-4 mimicked GLP-1 through stimulating the GLP-1 receptor. The much greater stability of exendin-4 led to its experimental and clinical evaluation as an anti-diabetic agent and its introduction to the market in 2005. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A new locality in Jiangxi Province has recently produced a fossil lizard assemblage including two genera of herbivores and the partial skull and lower jaws of a terrestrial predator. The latter combines large size, the possession of a small number of recurved, well-separated marginal teeth, a blunt rostrum, and rounded cranial osteoderms. It resembles Estesia from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia, but is distinct in its jaw morphology and the possession of cranial osteoderms. It is therefore placed in a new genus and species, Chianghsia nankangensis. Phylogenetic analysis groups Chianghsia unequivocally with the Platynota, the group to which living monitor lizards and extinct mosasaurs belong.

Origin and convergent evolution of exendin genes,"['Irwin, DM']",GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY,10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.11.025,JAN 1 2012,5,"Exendins are secretin hormone-like peptides that are components of the toxins from two venomous lizards, Heloderma suspectum (Gila monster) and Heloderma horridium (Mexican bearded lizard). Exendins-1 and -2 are vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-like, both in sequence and function, while exendins-3 and -4 are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-like. The evolutionary origin of these peptides, and the genes that encode them, has been unclear. Recently, genes orthologous to exendin have been identified in reptiles, birds and amphibians. Analysis of the orthologous sequences demonstrates that the Heloderma exendins diversified by gene duplication from a common exendin ancestor on the Heloderma lineage after divergence from other reptiles, including the anole lizard and Burmese python. In addition, the exendin toxin peptide sequences, but not their pro or signal peptides, have evolved very rapidly on the Heloderma lineage, likely as they adapted to their new function as toxins. Exendins-1 and -2 not only evolved rapidly but their sequences have evolved convergently upon that of VIP, resulting in a doubling of its identity with VIP, while exendins-3 and -4 have retained an ancestral property of being more GLP-1-like sequences. These results suggest that the ancestral role of exendin, which is potentially still retained in some species, had greater similarity with proglucagon-derived peptides or GIP. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

"Mast cell chymase reduces the toxicity of Gila monster venom, scorpion venom, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in mice","['Akahoshi, M', 'Song, CH', 'Piliponsky, AM', 'Metz, M', 'Guzzetta, A', 'Abrink, M', 'Schlenner, SM', 'Feyerabend, TB', 'Rodewald, HR', 'Pejler, G', 'Tsai, M', 'Galli, SJ']",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION,10.1172/JCI46139,OCT 2011,40,"Mast cell degranulation is important in the pathogenesis of anaphylaxis and allergic disorders. Many animal venoms contain components that can induce mast cell degranulation, and this has been thought to contribute to the pathology and mortality caused by envenomation. However, we recently reported evidence that mast cells can enhance the resistance of mice to the venoms of certain snakes and that mouse mast cell-derived carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) can contribute to this effect. Here, we investigated whether mast cells can enhance resistance to the venom of the Gila monster, a toxic component of that venom (helodermin), and the structurally similar mammalian peptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Using 2 types of mast cell-deficient mice, as well as mice selectively lacking CPA3 activity or the chymase mouse mast cell protease-4 (MCPT4), we found that mast cells and MCPT4, which can degrade helodermin, can enhance host resistance to the toxicity of Gila monster venom. Mast cells and MCPT4 also can limit the toxicity associated with high concentrations of VIP and can reduce the morbidity and mortality induced by venoms from 2 species of scorpions. Our findings support the notion that mast cells can enhance innate defense by degradation of diverse animal toxins and that release of MCPT4, in addition to CPA3, can contribute to this mast cell function."
Incretin hormones and the expanding families of glucagon-like sequences and their receptors,"['Irwin, DM', 'Prentice, KJ', 'GOLDFISH CARASSIUS-AURATUS']",DIABETES OBESITY & METABOLISM,NA,OCT 2011,10,"Peptide hormones encoded by the proglucagon (Gcg) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (Gip) genes are evolutionarily related glucagon-like sequences and act through a subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. A better understanding of the evolutionary history of these hormones and receptors should yield insight into their biological functions. The availability of a large number of near-complete vertebrate genome sequences is a powerful resource to address questions concerning the evolution of sequences; here, we utilize these resources to examine the evolution of glucagon-like sequences and their receptors. These studies led to the discovery of novel genes for a glucagon receptor-like receptor (Grlr) and a glucagon-like sequence (exendin) in vertebrates. Both exendin and GRLR have ancient origins, early in vertebrate evolution, but have been lost on the ancestral lineage leading to extant mammals. We also show that exendin and GRLR are both expressed in the brain of the chicken and Xenopus tropicals, results that suggest that the products of these genes function in this tissue. The lack of exendin or Grlr genes in mammals suggests that other genes may have acquired the functions of exendin and Grlr during mammalian evolution."
"Hematology, leukocyte cytochemical analysis, plasma biochemistry, and plasma electrophoresis of wild-caught and captive-bred Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum)","['Cooper-Bailey, K', 'Smith, SA', 'Zimmerman, K', 'Lane, R', 'Raskin, RE', 'DeNardo, D']",VETERINARY CLINICAL PATHOLOGY,10.1111/j.1939-165X.2011.00337.x,SEP 2011,5,"Background: The Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum), one of several venomous lizard species in the world, is found within the United States and Mexico and is recognized as an iconic symbol of the American Southwest. Thus, Gila monsters are of growing interest in the captive reptile trade and within zoological and educational institutions.

Objectives: The aims of this study were to determine results for CBCs, describe cytochemical reactions in WBCs, and obtain plasma biochemical and protein electrophoresis results from wild-caught and captive-bred H. suspectum.

Methods: Ventral tail vein blood samples were obtained from 16 captive (14 wild-caught and 2 captive-bred) Gila monsters. CBCs, RBC morphometric analysis, plasma biochemical analysis, and protein electrophoresis were performed. Leukocytes were stained for peroxidase, Sudan black B (SBB), chloroacetate esterase, napthyl butyrate esterase, and leukocyte alkaline phosphatase, and blood smears were examined for the presence of hemoparasites.

Results: The median (range) PCV was 37% (22-50%) and WBC count was 4.6 x 10(3)/mu L (3.3-6.4 x 10(3)/mu L) with approximately 50% heterophils and fewer lymphocytes, basophils, azurophils, and monocytes in decreasing order. Cytochemical reactions were unique among reptiles with strong staining for peroxidase and SBB in monocytes/azurophils. Biochemical results were similar to those of earlier reports with slight increases in uric acid and urea concentrations. Plasma electrophoretic results indicated that albumin was approximately equal to the combined globulin fractions.

Conclusions: Results of blood analysis in healthy wild-caught and captive-bred H. suspectum may be useful for monitoring health status in this species."

Therefore, a properly labeled ligand that binds to GLP-1R could be used for in vivo pancreatic islet imaging. Because native GLP-1 is degraded rapidly by dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), a more stable agonist of GLP-1 such as Exendin-4 is a preferred imaging agent. In this study, DO3A-VS-Cys(40)-Exendin-4 was prepared through the conjugation of DO3A-VS with Cys(40)-Exendin-4. The in vitro binding affinity of DO3A-VS-Cys(40)-Exendin-4 was evaluated in INS-1 cells, which overexpress GLP-1R. After Cu-64 labeling, biodistribution studies and microPET imaging of Cu-64-DO3A-VS-Cys(40)-Exendin-4 were performed on both subcutaneous INS-1 tumors and islet transplantation models. The subcutaneous INS-1 tumor was dearly visualized with microPET imaging after the injection of Cu-64-DO3A-VS-Cys(40)-Exendin-4. GLP-1R positive organs, such as pancreas and lung, showed high uptake. Tumor uptake was saturable, reduced dramatically by a 20-fold excess of unlabeled Exendin-4. In the intraportal islet transplantation models, Cu-64-DO3A-VS-Cys(40)-Exendin-4 demonstrated almost two times higher uptake compared with normal mice. Cu-64-DO3A-VS-Cys(40)-Exendin-4 demonstrated persistent and specific uptake in the mouse pancreas, the subcutaneous insulinoma mouse model, and the intraportal human islet transplantation mouse model.

The natriuretic peptide/helokinestatin precursor from Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum) venom: Amino acid sequence deduced from cloned cDNA and identification of two novel encoded helokinestatins,"['Ma, CB', 'Yang, M', 'Zhou, M', 'Wu, YX', 'Wang, L', 'Chen, TB', 'Ding, AW', 'Shaw, C']",PEPTIDES,10.1016/j.peptides.2011.03.012,JUN 2011,1,"Natriuretic peptides are common components of reptile venoms and molecular cloning of their biosynthetic precursors has revealed that in snakes, they co-encode bradykinin-potentiating peptides and in venomous lizards, some co-encode bradykinin inhibitory peptides such as the helokinestatins. The common natriuretic peptide/helokinestatin precursor of the Gila Monster, Heloderma suspectum, encodes five helokinestatins of differing primary structures. Here we report the molecular cloning of a natriuretic peptide/helokinestatin precursor cDNA from a venom-derived cDNA library of the Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum). Deduction of the primary structure of the encoded precursor protein from this cloned cDNA template revealed that it consisted of 196 amino acid residues encoding a single natriuretic peptide and five helokinestatins. While the natriuretic peptide was of identical primary structure to its Gila Monster (H. suspectum) homolog, the encoded helokinestatins were not, with this region of the common precursor displaying some significant differences to its H. suspectum homolog. The helokinestatin-encoding region contained a single copy of helokinestatin-1, 2 copies of helokinestatin-3 and single copies of 2 novel peptides, (Phe)(5)-helokinestatin-2 (VPPAFVPLVPR) and helokinestatin-6 (GPPFNPPPFVDYEPR). All predicted peptides were found in reverse phase HPLC fractions of the same venom. Synthetic replicates of both novel helokinestatins were found to antagonize the relaxing effect of bradykinin on rat tail artery smooth muscle. Thus lizard venom continues to provide a source of novel biologically active peptides. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc."

Consequently, very little is known about the timings of toxin recruitment events, venom protein molecular evolution, or even the relative physical diversifications of the venom system itself. A multidisciplinary approach was used to examine the evolution across the full taxonomical range of this similar to 130 million-year-old clade. Analysis of cDNA libraries revealed complex venom transcriptomes. Most notably, three new cardioactive peptide toxin types were discovered (celestoxin, cholecystokinin, and YY peptides). The latter two represent additional examples of convergent use of genes in toxic arsenals, both having previously been documented as components of frog skin defensive chemical secretions. Two other novel venom gland-overexpressed modified versions of other protein frameworks were also recovered from the libraries (epididymal secretory protein and ribonuclease). Lectin, hyaluronidase, and veficolin toxin types were sequenced for the first time from lizard venoms and shown to be homologous to the snake venom forms. In contrast, phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the lizard natriuretic peptide toxins were recruited independently of the form in snake venoms. The de novo evolution of helokinestatin peptide toxin encoding do-mains within the lizard venom natriuretic gene was revealed to be exclusive to the helodermatid/anguid subclade. New isoforms were sequenced for cysteine-rich secretory protein, kallikrein, and phospholipase A 2 toxins. Venom gland morphological analysis revealed extensive evolutionary tinkering. Anguid glands are characterized by thin capsules and mixed glands, serous at the bottom of the lobule and mucous toward the apex. Twice, independently this arrangement was segregated into specialized serous protein-secreting glands with thick capsules with the mucous lobules now distinct (Heloderma and the Lanthanotus/Varanus clade). The results obtained highlight the importance of utilizing evolution-based search strategies for biodiscovery and emphasize the largely untapped drug design and development potential of lizard venoms.

A model selection procedure and diagnostic tests indicated that a von Bertalanffy curve with seasonal cessation of growth and a random effect for asymptotic size fit the data best. Young Gila Monsters in our study grew faster than previously reported growth rates from both field and captive animals, and we discuss potential reasons for this discrepancy."

Two different biosynthetic precursors were consistently cloned from a venom-derived cDNA library. The first encoded helokinestatins 1-4 and a single copy of C-type natriuretic peptide, as previously described, whereas the second was virtually identical, lacking only a single prolyl codon as found in the mature attenuated helokinestatin-5 peptide.

Conservation phylogenetics of helodermatid lizards using multiple molecular markers and a supertree approach,"['Douglas, ME', 'Douglas, MR', 'Schuett, GW', 'Beck, DD', 'Sullivan, BK']",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.ympev.2009.12.009,APR 2010,13,"We analyzed both mitochondrial (MT-) and nuclear (N) DNAs in a conservation phylogenetic framework to examine deep and shallow histories of the Beaded Lizard (Heloderma horridum) and Gila Monster (H. suspectum) throughout their geographic ranges in North and Central America. Both MTDNA and intron markers clearly partitioned each species. One intron and MTDNA further subdivided H. horridum into its four recognized subspecies (H. It. alvarezi, charlesbogerti, exasperatum, and horridum). However, the two subspecies of H. suspectum (H. s. suspectum and H. s. cinctum) were undefined. A supertree approach sustained these relationships. Overall, the Helodermatidae is reaffirmed as an ancient and conserved group. Its most recent common ancestor (MRCA) was Lower Eocene [35.4 million years ago (mya)], with a similar to 25 my period of stasis before the MRCA of H. horridum diversified in Lower Miocene. Another similar to 5 my passed before H. h. exasperatum and H. h. horridum diverged, followed by similar to 1.5 my before H. h. alvarezi and H. h. charlesbogerti separated. Heloderma suspectum reflects an even longer period of stasis (similar to 30 my) before diversifying from its MRCA. Both H. suspectum (Mexico) and H. h. alvarezi also revealed evidence of historic range expansion following a recent bottleneck. Our conservation phylogenetic approach emphasizes the origin and diversification of this group, yields information on the manner by which past environmental variance may have impacted its populations and, in turn, allows us to disentangle historic from contemporary impacts that might threaten its long-term persistence. The value of helodermatid conservation resides in natural services and medicinal products, particularly venom constituents, and these are only now being realized.. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

"Seasonal Patterns of Body Condition, Hydration State, and Activity of Gila Monsters (Heloderma suspectum) at a Sonoran Desert Site","['Davis, JR', 'DeNardo, DF']",JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY,NA,MAR 2010,13,"Animals in nature use synergistic behavioral and physiological responses to cope with variation in resource availability. We used a combination of traditional tools (i.e., radiotelemetry, body-condition measurements, plasma osmometry, and direct observation) and contemporary techniques (i.e., implanted temperature loggers and portable ultrasonography) to identify seasonal patterns of body condition, hydration state, and surface activity of 16 free-living Gila Monsters during two active seasons. Despite seasonal drought each year, Gila Monster snout-vent length increased during the study; yet body mass, tail volume, and hydration state decreased. Generally, surface activity was associated with rainy periods, and males were significantly more active than females but only during the reproductive season. Our results indicate that Gila Monsters combine flexible behavioral patterns (i.e., the timing and duration of surface activity), resource storage and economical use, and tolerance of substantial physiological disturbance to endure seasonal resource limitations at a site in the Arizona-Upland subdivision of the Sonoran Desert."

The incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), work together to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia by glucose-dependent insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon release, as well as inhibition of GI motility and gastric emptying. GLP-1 is considered the more effective of the two incretins due to its additional inhibitory effects on GI motility. It is observed that patients on treatment with GLP-1 analogues or exenatide achieve a considerable weight loss during treatment. This is of benefit to improve insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, weight loss per se is of considerable benefit in an even longer health perspective. The weight loss is considered to be due to the inhibition of GI motility. This effect has been studied in animal experimentation, and from there taken to involve studies on GI motility in healthy volunteers and patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Evolving to a phase II study in IBS, the GLP-1 analogue (ROSE-010) was recently shown to be effective for treatment of acute pain attacks in IBS. Taken together, data speak in favor of GI motility as a central component not only in metabolic disorders but also in IBS, be it due to a direct relaxing effect on GI smooth muscle or a slow emptying of gastric contents resulting in a less outspoken nutritional demand on hormonal regulatory functions in the GI tract.

However, the underlying reason for such seasonality can be hard to discern because the rainy season is often associated with shifts in temperature as well as water and food availability. We used a combination of the natural climate pattern of the Sonoran Desert and periodic water supplementation to determine the extent to which water intake influenced both the behavioral ecology and the physiological ecology of a long-lived desert lizard, the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) (Cope 1869). Water-supplemented lizards had lower plasma osmolality (i.e., were more hydrated) and maintained urinary bladder water reserves better during seasonal drought than did control lizards. During seasonal drought, water-supplemented lizards were surface active a significantly greater proportion of time than were controls. This increased surface activity can lead to greater food acquisition for supplemental Gila monsters because tail volume (an index of caudal lipid stores) was significantly greater in supplemented lizards compared with controls in one of the two study years."
Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Activation Modulates Pancreatitis-Associated Gene Expression But Does Not Modify the Susceptibility to Experimental Pancreatitis in Mice,"['Koehler, JA', 'Baggio, LL', 'Lamont, BJ', 'Ali, S', 'Drucker, DJ']",DIABETES,10.2337/db09-0626,SEP 2009,86,"OBJECTIVE-Clinical reports link use of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists exenatide and liraglutide to pancreatitis. However, whether these agents act on the exocrine pancreas is poorly understood.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We assessed whether the antidiabetic agents exendin (Ex)4, liraglutide, the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin, or the biguanide metformin were associated with changes in expression of genes associated with the development of experimental pancreatitis. The effects of Ex-4 when administered before or after the initiation of caerulein-induced experimental pancreatitis were determined. The importance of endogenous GLP-1R signaling for gene expression in the exocrine pancreas and the severity of pancreatitis was assessed in Glp1r(-/-) mice.

RESULTS-Acute administration of Ex-4 increased expression of egr-1 and c-fos in the exocrine pancreas. Administration of Ex-4 or liraglutide for 1 week increased pancreas weight and induced expression of mRNA transcripts encoding the anti-inflammatory proteins pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) (RegIII beta) and RegIII alpha. Chronic Ex-4 treatment of high-fat-fed mice increased expression of PAP and reduced pancreatic expression of mRNA transcripts encoding for the proinflammatory monocyte chemotactic protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3. Sitagliptin and metformin did not significantly change pancreatic gene expression profiles. Ex-4 administered before or after caerulein did not modify the severity of experimental pancreatitis, and levels of pancreatic edema and serum amylase were comparable in caerulein-treated Glp1r(-/-) versus Glp1r(+/+) mice.

CONCLUSIONS-These findings demonstrate that GLP-1 receptor activation increases pancreatic mass and selectively modulates the expression of genes associated with pancreatitis. However, activation or genetic elimination of GLP-1R signaling does not modify the severity of experimental pancreatitis in mice. Diabetes 58:2148-2161, 2009"
The effect of exenatide re-exposure on safety and efficacy,"['Faludi, P', 'Brodows, R', 'Burger, J', 'Ivanyi, T', 'Braun, DK']",PEPTIDES,10.1016/j.peptides.2009.06.026,SEP 2009,12,"Exenatide, a synthetic peptide originally isolated from salivary secretions of Heloderma suspectum, like other subcutaneously injected peptides, can cause antibody formation.

The objective of this multicenter, open-label study was to investigate the response of anti-exenatide antibody formation and the incidence of immune-related and hypersensitivity reactions after exenatide re-exposure. Fifty-eight patients (57% male; 59 +/- 10 years; weight 85 +/- 19 kg; HbA1 c 8.1 +/- 0.9%; duration of diabetes 10 +/- 5 years) were enrolled. At study initiation, 98.3% of patients were taking I or more antidiabetes drugs, including oral medication and various types of insulin. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) at any time during the study were observed in 40 and 47% of patients with positive and negative treatment-emergent antibodies, respectively. Immune-related AEs were observed in 6 patients (4 were antibody positive). These AEs had not been reported in their previous exposure to exenatide. Re-exposure to exenatide did not result in increased hypersensitivity reactions. Overall, 72% of patients had a baseline to endpoint reduction in HbA1c (range -0.1 to -2.8%), and 87% of antibody negative versus 62% of antibody positive patients had an HbA1c endpoint reduction. The study design and the patients' baseline characteristics, including diabetes treatment at study initiation, are confounding factors limiting clinical conclusions on exenatide's glycemic effect in this patient population. The study results indicate that anti-exenatide antibody formation did not increase the incidence of TEAEs in patients re-exposed to exenatide. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
The Extrapancreatic Effects of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 and Related Peptides,"['Abu-Hamdah, R', 'Rabiee, A', 'Meneilly, GS', 'Shannon, RP', 'Andersen, DK', 'Elahi, D']",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM,10.1210/jc.2008-1296,JUN 2009,94,"Context: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 7-36 amide, an insulinotropichormone released from the intestinal L cells in response to nutrient ingestion, has been extensively reviewed with respect to beta-cell function. However GLP-1 receptors are abundant in many other tissues. Thus, the function of GLP-1 is not limited to the islet cells, and it has regulatory actions on many other organs.

Evidence Acquisition: A review of published, peer-reviewed medical literature (1987 to September 2008) on the extrapancreatic actions of GLP-1 was performed.

Evidence Synthesis: The extrapancreatic actions of GLP-1 include inhibition of gastric emptying and gastric acid secretion, thereby fulfilling the definition of GLP-1 as an enterogastrone. Other important extrapancreatic actions of GLP-1 include a regulatory role in hepatic glucose production, the inhibition of pancreatic exocrine secretion, cardioprotective and cardiotropic effects, the regulation of appetite and satiety, and stimulation of afferent sensory nerves. The primary metabolite of GLP-1, GLP-1 (9-36) amide, or GLP-1m, is the truncated product of degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4. GLP-1m has insulinomimetic effects on hepatic glucose production and cardiac function. Exendin-4 present in the salivary gland of the reptile, Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum), is a high-affinity agonist for the mammalian GLP-1 receptor. It is resistant to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4, and therefore has a prolonged half-life.

Conclusion: GLP-1 and its metabolite have important extrapancreatic effects particularly with regard to the cardiovascular system and insulinomimetic effects with respect to glucose homeostasis. These effects may be particularly important in the obese state. GLP-1, GLP-1m, and exendin-4 therefore have potential therapeutic roles because of their diffuse extrapancreatic actions.

Does urbanization influence the spatial ecology of Gila monsters in the Sonoran Desert?,"['Kwiatkowski, MA', 'Schuett, GW', 'Repp, RA', 'Nowak, EM', 'Sullivan, BK']",JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,10.1111/j.1469-7998.2008.00495.x,DEC 2008,7,"To assess whether urbanization influences the spatial ecology of a rare and protected venomous reptilian predator, the Gila monster Heloderma suspectum, we compared home range (HR) size and movement parameters at three sites varying in degree of urbanization in the Sonoran Desert. We predicted that the urban population of H. suspectum would exhibit smaller HRs, avoid human structures and show less movement. Multivariate analysis indicated that males generally exhibited larger HRs and had higher movement rates and activity levels than females at all three sites. Contrary to our predictions, however, HR size and movement parameters did not vary across the sites in relation to the level of urbanization. At the urban site, individuals often crossed narrow roads and regularly used artificial structures as refuges for extended periods. Furthermore, the population sex ratio at the urban site was female-biased, consistent with the expectation that occupation of larger HRs and higher movement rates results in higher mortality for males in urbanized areas. Gila monsters did not appear to alter certain aspects of their spatial ecology in response to low levels of human activity but additional work will be required to assess population viability and possible effects in the long term and with higher levels of urbanization."
An automated temperature-based option for estimating surface activity and refuge use patterns in free-ranging animals,"['Davis, JR', 'Taylor, EN', 'DeNardo, DF']",JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS,10.1016/j.jaridenv.2008.02.018,AUG 2008,5,"Accurately assessing free-ranging animals' patterns of surface activity and refuge use is critical, yet fundamentally challenging for biologists and wildlife managers. We evaluate the accuracy of an automated technique-temperature-based activity estimation (TBAE)-in estimating surface activity and refuge use patterns of two sympatric reptiles, the western diamond-backed rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) and the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) in the Sonoran Desert. TBAE derived from a comparison of body temperature to shaded air temperature was effective in estimating the overall percent surface activity for both rattlesnakes (observed surface activity 51.8%, TBAE estimated surface activity 48.2%) and Gila monsters (observed 22.3%, TBAE 24.5%). There was, however, considerable interspecific difference in the effectiveness of TBAE in predicting surface activity at specific time points; TBAE was far more accurate for Gila monsters than for rattlesnakes (96% vs. 66% time point-specific accuracy, respectively). We assert that, when validated, TBAE can be used to yield concurrent and accurate body temperatures and activity estimates for multiple free-ranging animals, particularly in and environments, which improves our understanding of animal biology and can be used to inform management decisions.

Water storage compromises walking endurance in an active forager: evidence of a trade-off between osmoregulation and locomotor performance,"['Davis, JR', 'DeNardo, DF']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY,10.1007/s00359-008-0342-2,AUG 2008,2,"Trade-offs between locomotor performance and load-carrying in animals are well-established and often result from requisite life processes including reproduction and feeding. Osmoregulation, another necessary process, may involve storage of fluid in the urinary bladder of some species. The purpose of this study was to determine whether storage of urine in the urinary bladder reduces walking endurance in an actively foraging lizard. The results of our paired-design study indicate that the volume of fluid stored in the urinary bladder (36.5 +/- 1.6 ml) contributed a significant load (9.2% of body mass) to the lizards. This load resulted in a disproportionate 24.5 +/- 2.8% decrement in walking endurance. Specifically, Gila monsters walked at a fixed pace for a significantly shorter duration when the urinary bladder contained fluid (26 +/- 2.0 min) compared to when the bladder was empty (34.3 +/- 2.3 min). Since fluid stored in the bladder contributes to osmoregulation in this species, our results indicate the presence of a trade-off between osmoregulation and endurance in Gila monsters. Bearing other loads (e.g., a clutch or meal) influences the evolution of life-history traits and foraging strategy; thus the negative effect of fluid storage on endurance may also have evolutionary implications."
Nucleoside composition of Heloderma venoms,"['Aird, SD']",COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cbpb.2008.02.012,JUN 2008,1,"Venoms of Heloderma horridum and Heloderma suspectum were analyzed for the possible presence of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. Adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, hypoxanthine, inosine, and uridine were found in mu g quantities. These amounts are much smaller than those seen in many elapid or viperine venoms, but greater and more varied than those found in crotaline venoms. While their contribution to the hypotension induced by Heloderma venoms may be minor, venom nucleosides nonetheless act in concert with kallikreins/hemorrhagins, alkaline phosphomonoesterase, 5'-nucleotidase, helodermin, helospectins, helothermine, and serotonin. The use of nucleosides as toxins is therefore a generalized squamate strategy, rather than the exclusive province of snakes. Both Heloderma venoms were found to be devoid of NADase and phosphodiesterase activities. Enzymes to release endogenous purines in the prey, are not significant components of Heloderma venoms.

Ecological interactions between Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum) and desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii),"['Gienger, CM', 'Tracy, CR']",SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST,10.1894/0038-4909(2008)53[265:EIBGMH]2.0.CO;2,JUN 2008,2,"We report on ecological interactions between the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) and the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) in the Mojave Desert of southern Nevada. Eggs of desert tortoises are an important source of food for Gila monsters, and although tortoises are not always successful, they vigorously defend their nests from predation by Gila monsters. Shelters were co-occupied by these two species only during the nesting season for desert tortoises, and Gila monsters occupied shelters almost exclusively with female tortoises, probably because these shelters were nesting sites."
Preparation and characterization of a novel exendin-4 human serum albumin fusion protein expressed in Pichia pastoris,"['Huang, YS', 'Chen, Z', 'Chen, YQ', 'Ma, GC', 'Shan, JF', 'Liu, W', 'Zhou, LF']",JOURNAL OF PEPTIDE SCIENCE,10.1002/psc.942,MAY 2008,20,"A novel recombinant exendin-4 human serum albumin fusion protein (rEx-4/HSA) expressed in Pichia pastoris was prepared and characterized. Ex-4 is a 39-amino acid peptide isolated from the salivary gland of the lizard Heloderma suspectum and is thought to be a novel therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes. But to gain a continued effect, the peptide has to be injected twice a day owing to its short plasma half-life (T-1/2 = 2.4 h). To extend the half-life of Ex-4 molecule in vivo, we designed a genetically engineered Ex-4/HSA fusion protein. Between Ex-4 and HSA, a peptide linker GGGGS was inserted and the fusion protein was expressed in methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris with native HSA secretion signal sequence. The recombinant protein was secreted correctly and was obtained with high purity (typically >98%) by a three-step purification procedure. cAMP assay demonstrated that the fusion protein had a bioactivity similar to Ex-4 for interaction with GLP-1 receptors in vitro. Results from oral glucose tolerance test indicated that rEx-4/HSA could effectively improve glucose tolerance in diabetic db/db mice. Pharmacokinetics studies in cynomologus monkeys also showed that rEx-4/HSA had a much longer plasma half-life. Therefore, rEx-4/HSA fusion protein could potentially be used as a new recombinant biodrug for type 2 diabetes therapy. Copyright (C) 2007 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Helokinestatin: A new bradykinin B-2 receptor antagonist decapeptide from lizard venom,"['Kwok, HF', 'Chen, T', ""O'Rourke, M"", 'Ivanyi, C', 'Hirst, D', 'Shaw, C']",PEPTIDES,10.1016/j.peptides.2007.10.025,JAN 2008,9,"Synthetic bradykinin antagonist peptides/peptoids have been powerful tools for delineating the roles of kinins in both normal physiology and in pathological states. Here, we report the identification of a novel, naturally occurring bradykinin B-2 receptor antagonist peptide, helokinestatin, isolated and structurally characterized from the venoms of helodermatid lizards-the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) and the Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum). The primary structure of the peptide was established by a combination of microsequencing and mass spectroscopy as Gly-Pro-Pro-Tyr-Gln-Pro-Leu-Val-Pro-Arg (M-r 1122.62). A synthetic replicate of helokinestatin was found to inhibit bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation of phenylephrine pre-constricted rat tail artery smooth muscle, mediated by the B-2 receptor sub-type, in a dose-dependent manner. Natural selection, that generates functional optimization of predatory reptile venom peptides, can potentially provide new insights for drug lead design or for normal physiological or pathophysiological processes.
