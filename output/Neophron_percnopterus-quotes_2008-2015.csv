"Identifying key demographic parameters for the viability of a growing population of the endangered Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus
","['Tauler, H', 'Real, J', 'Hernandez-Matias, A', 'Aymerich, P', 'Baucells, J', 'Martorell, C', 'Santandreu, J']",BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL,10.1017/S0959270914000392,DEC 2015,0,"The Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus is a threatened species throughout its worldwide range. The Iberian Peninsula holds 50% of its global population, which has declined by 25% over the last 20 years. Despite this negative global trend, an increase in the number of individuals over the last 25 years has been observed in Catalonia, where it has colonised areas in which it was previously unknown. In this study, we describe the demographic evolution of an increasing population of Egyptian Vultures in central and eastern Catalonia and we apply population models and maximum likelihood procedures to investigate both the main demographic processes driving the observed trends and the viability of the population. The number of pairs in this region increased from one to 22 in the period 1988-2012. The best-supported models suggest that adult survival in this population may be higher than in other Iberian populations and that furthermore, there is a continuous influx of immigrants. Based on the most likely scenarios, Population Viability Analysis predicts that the population will continue to increase. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the adult survival rate has the greatest influence on population dynamics so conservation efforts will be more effective if concentrated on improving this rate."
Population decline and range contraction of the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus in the Balkan Peninsula,"['Velevski, M', 'Nikolov, SC', 'Ben Hallmann', 'Dobrev, V', 'Sidiropoulos, L', 'Saravia, V', 'Tsiakiris, R', 'Arkumarev, V', 'Galanaki, A', 'Kominos, T', 'Stara, K', 'Kret, E', 'Grubac, B', 'Lisicanec, E', 'Kastritis, T', 'Vavylis, D', 'Topi, M', 'Hoxha, B', 'Oppel, S']",BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL,10.1017/S0959270914000343,DEC 2015,1,"The Egyptian Vulture has been classified as Endangered' due to a rapid population decline in India and long term declines in Europe and Africa. Although the species has been reported to be declining in Eastern Europe, no quantitative assessment of the magnitude or the causes for population declines are available. We used monitoring data from the Balkan Peninsula to estimate changes in population size and extent of occurrence of Egyptian Vultures between 1980 and 2013. We quantified population trends in three countries (Bulgaria, Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic [FYR] of Macedonia) to assess whether population declines are similar within the Balkan range states. We found a rapid and consistent decline of the Egyptian Vulture population that was largely similar among the three countries (lambda = 0.940 in FYR of Macedonia, 0.951 in Bulgaria, 0.920 in Greece). As a consequence of population declines, the breeding range of Egyptian Vultures has contracted and the population in the Balkan Peninsula has fragmented into six subpopulations separated by more than 80 km. Population declines may be driven by factors such as poisoning, electrocution, direct persecution and changes in food availability which operate at large spatial scales and affect birds both on breeding grounds as well as during migration and wintering. Because the relative importance of threats to the survival of Egyptian Vultures are poorly understood, there is a critical need for research into causes of mortality and potential conservation actions that may halt and reverse population declines."
Modeling the consequences of the demise and potential recovery of a keystone-species: wild rabbits and avian scavengers in Mediterranean landscapes,"['Cortes-Avizanda, A', 'Colomer, MA', 'Margalida, A', 'Ceballos, O', 'Donazar, JA']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,10.1038/srep17033,NOV 23 2015,0,"Restoration of demised keystone-species populations is an overriding concern in conservation biology. However, since no population is independent of its environment, progress is needed in predicting the efficacy of restoration in unstable ecological contexts. Here, by means of Population Dynamics P-system Models (PDP), we studied long-term changes in the population size of Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) inhabiting a Natural Park, northern Spain, to changes in the numbers of wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), a keystone-species of Mediterranean ecosystems that have suffered >90% population decline after a hemorrhagic disease outbreak. Low availability of rabbit carcasses leads Egyptian vultures to extend their foraging activities to unprotected areas with higher non-natural mortality whereas growing numbers of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus), a dominant competitor, progressively monopolize trophic resources resulting in a focal population decrease. Modeling shows that, even if keystone-species populations recover in core protected areas, the return to the original studied population size may be unfeasible, due to both the high non-natural mortality rates in humanized areas and long-term changes in the scavenger guild structure. Policy decisions aimed to restore keystone-species should rely on holistic approaches integrating the effects of spatial heterogeneity on both producer and consumer populations as well as within-guild processes."
Relative contribution of local demography and immigration in the recovery of a geographically-isolated population of the endangered Egyptian vulture,"['Lieury, N', 'Gallardo, M', 'Ponchon, C', 'Besnard, A', 'Millon, A']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2015.07.008,NOV 2015,0,"In a context of increasing concern for biodiversity conservation but decreasing resources devoted to species management, measuring the impact of actions is critically needed so as to optimise conservation practices. Long-term longitudinal data collected on marked individuals allow for an assessment of the demographic response of a population to conservation actions while accounting for potential confounding factors. This study focused on the recovery of a geographically-isolated population of the endangered Egyptian vulture in south-eastern France, which experienced food shortages induced by major changes in habitat and sanitary legislation limiting the abandonment of dead animals in the field. The survival rates and population dynamics of the Egyptian vulture were computed, following the implementation of supplementary feeding stations, while accounting for the potential variation in environmental conditions on wintering grounds, reproduction and immigration. An integrated population model (IPM) was used to combine capture-resighting data with recoveries of dead birds, breeding surveys and counts of territorial pairs over a 16-year period. Results showed that the implementation of vulture restaurants improved the local survival rates and successfully stabilised the local demography of Egyptian vultures; this despite a reduction in average fecundity due to compensatory density feedback. Moreover, throughout the study period, about two thirds of the new recruits into the breeding population were immigrants, suggesting immigration constantly sustained the Egyptian vulture population in south-eastern France. However, we did not detect any effect of vulture restaurants on the immigration rate, indicating that the improvement of local survival by vulture restaurants remained the main driver of the positive shift in the population dynamics. This study highlights the positive impact of vulture restaurants on Egyptian vulture population restoration by compensating for natural food limitations. It also points out the methodological importance of estimating immigration for understanding population dynamics and that large-scale monitoring and internationally-concerted conservation should be promoted.

Age-dependent survival of island vs. mainland populations of two avian scavengers: delving into migration costs,"['Sanz-Aguilar, A', 'De Pablo, F', 'Donazar, JA']",OECOLOGIA,10.1007/s00442-015-3355-x,OCT 2015,0,"Large terrestrial long-lived birds (including raptors) are typically sedentary on islands, even when they are migratory on the mainland. Density-dependent variation in the age at first breeding has been described as responsible for the long-term persistence of long-lived bird populations on islands. However, sedentary island populations may also benefit from higher survival rates derived from the absence of migration costs, especially for young individuals. Thus, sedentary island populations can mimic a natural experiment to study migration costs. We estimated the age-dependent survival of two sedentary raptors on the island of Menorca (Egyptian vultures Neophron percnopterus and red kites Milvus milvus) and compared these estimates with those reported for other migratory and sedentary populations. In Menorca, Egyptian vultures, but not red kites, showed low levels of human-related mortality resulting in extremely high survival probabilities, probably due to different diet choices and behavioral patterns. Juvenile Egyptian vultures and red kites in the studied population had lower survival probabilities than adults. This difference, however, was smaller than those reported for mainland migrant populations, which showed a lower juvenile survival rate. In fact, between-population comparisons suggested that survival of the young in migrant populations may be triggered by mortality factors in wintering areas. In contrast, adult survival may respond to mortality factors in breeding areas. Our results suggest that raptor species that become sedentary on islands may benefit from higher pre-breeder survival prospects in comparison with their mainland migrant counterparts. This fact, in combination with an earlier age at first reproduction, may facilitate their persistence."
Livestock-driven land use change to model species distributions: Egyptian vulture as a case study,"['Mateo-Tomas, P', 'Olea, PP']",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.05.017,OCT 2015,0,"Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used to predict species ranges and their shifts under future scenarios of global environmental change (GEC). SDMs are thus incorporating key drivers of GEC (e.g. climate, land use) to improve predictions of species' habitat suitability (i.e. as an indicator of species occurrence). Yet, most SDMs incorporating land use only consider dominant land cover types, largely ignoring other key aspects of land use such as land management intensity and livestock. We developed SDMs including main land use components (i.e. land cover, livestock and its management intensity) to assess their relative importance in shaping habitat suitability for the Egyptian vulture, an endangered raptor linked to livestock presence. We modelled current and future (2020 and 2050) habitat suitability for this vulture using an organism-centred approach. This allowed us to account for basic species' habitat needs (i.e. nesting cliff) while gaining insight into our variables of interest (i.e. livestock and land cover). Once nest-site requirements were fulfilled, land use variables (i.e. openland and sheep and goat density) were the main factors determining species' habitat suitability. Current suitable area could decrease by up to 6.81% by 2050 under scenarios with rapid economic growth but no focus on environmental conservation and rural development. Local solutions to environmental sustainability and rural development could double current habitat suitability by 2050. Land use is expected to play a key role in determining Egyptian vulture's distribution through land cover change but also through changes in livestock management (i.e. species and stocking density). Change in stocking densities (sheep and goats/km(2)) becomes thus an indicator of habitat suitability for this vulture in our study area. Abandonment of agro-pastoral practises (i.e. below similar to 15-20 sheep and goats/km(2)) will negatively influence the species distribution. Nonetheless, livestock densities above these values will not further increase habitat suitability. Given the widespread impacts of livestock on ecosystems, the role of livestock and its management intensity in SDMs for other (non-livestock-related) species should be further explored.

Optimization of supplementary feeding programs for European vultures depends on environmental and management factors,"['Moreno-Opo, R', 'Trujillano, A', 'Margalida, A']",ECOSPHERE,10.1890/ES15-00009.1,JUL 2015,0,"Despite the consensus among ecologists and conservationists of the importance of maintaining scavenger feeding patterns based primarily on natural prey sources, human-mediated feeding remains a widely used management tool for threatened wildlife. Thus, it is important to understand the key factors favoring certain species and age-groups at supplementary feeding sites. Through a detailed videomonitored experiment of carrion inputs at different locations in the Iberian Peninsula (home of >90% of European vultures), we assessed how variables related to weather, time, demography, management and alternative food availability influenced the occurrence patterns of different age-classes of vultures at feeding sites. The most threatened and less gregarious species (bearded vulture Gypaetus barbatus and Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus) attended to earlier inputs, thus reducing interspecific competition with the Eurasian griffon vulture Gyps fulvus. The bearded vulture was favored by a larger biomass supply at the feeding sites during the chick-rearing period, while the Egyptian vulture preferred frequent and abundant inputs. Non-adult cinereous vultures Aegypius monachus were favored at times of lower abundance of natural resources and in the densest networks of feeding sites, while adults preferentially attended sites with periodic inputs close to breeding colonies in areas with lower availability of other natural prey. Finally, the Eurasian griffon vulture showed a preference for continued and periodic inputs, and for feeding sites with numerous other feeding sites in the surroundings. Our results help to inform the management of supplementing food provision with the aim of enhancing its value to reverse the unfavorable conservation status of endangered species and to mitigate the negative effects of the current global threats impacting them."

The prevalence and antimicrobial-susceptibility profiles of Salmonella spp. were assessed in 263 cases in wildlife from 22 animal orders from a wildlife rehabilitation center in Catalonia (NE Spain), September 2013 May 2014. Eleven of 263 tested animals were positive for Salmonella spp., representing an overall prevalence of 4.2%. Prevalences by taxonomic categories were 2% in mammals, 4.7% in birds, and 4.5% in reptiles. By species, one each of European hedgehog (Erinaceus europeus; from a sample of n=26), Eurasian Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo; n=2), Barn Owl (Tyto alba; n=3), Tawny Owl (Strix aluco; n=20), Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus; n=1), Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus; n=1), and Hoopoe (Upupa epops; n=2), and two each Common Kestrels (Falco tinnunculus; n=16) and pond sliders (Trachemys scripta; n=25) were positive for Salmonella. By serotyping, seven of eleven isolates were classified as S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, and five of seven belonged to the monophasic variant 4,12:i:-. All the monophasic variants were isolated from birds (4/5 in raptors) and showed a multidrug-resistance (MDR) profile to at least ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and tetracycline (R-type ASSuT), and up to 12 antibiotics. The large proportion of S. Typhimurium monophasic MDR strains detected in wildlife never treated with antibiotics, especially in raptors, adds more complexity to the epidemiologic control of one of the most frequent serovars involved in human and livestock infection."
"Action on multiple fronts, illegal poisoning and wind farm planning, is required to reverse the decline of the Egyptian vulture in southern Spain","['Sanz-Aguilar, A', 'Sanchez-Zapata, JA', 'Carrete, M', 'Benitez, JR', 'Avila, E', 'Arenas, R', 'Donazar, JA']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2015.03.029,JUL 2015,2,"Large body-sized avian scavengers, including the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), are globally threatened due to human-related mortality so guidelines quantifying the efficacy of different management approaches are urgently needed. We used 14 years of territory and individual-based data on a small and geographically isolated Spanish population to estimate survival, recruitment and breeding success. We then forecasted their population viability under current vital rates and under management scenarios that mitigated the main sources of non-natural mortality at breeding grounds (fatalities from wind farms and illegal poisoning). Mean breeding success was 0.68 (SD = 0.17) under current conditions. Annual probabilities of survival were 0.72 (SE = 0.06) for fledglings and 2 yr old non-breeders, 0.73 (SE = 0.04) for non-breeders older than 2 yrs old and 0.93 (SE = 0.04) for breeders. Probabilities of recruitment were 0 for birds aged 1-4, 0.10 (SE = 0.06) for birds aged 5 and 0.19 (SE = 0.09) for older birds. Population viability analyses estimated an annual decline of 3-4% of the breeding population under current conditions. Our results indicate that only by combining different management actions in the breeding area, especially by removing the most important causes of human-related mortality (poisoning and collisions on wind farms), will the population grow and persist in the long term. Reinforcement with captive breeding may also have positive effects but only in combination with the reduction in causes of non-natural mortality. These results, although obtained for a focal species, may be applicable to other endangered populations of long-lived avian scavengers inhabiting southern Europe. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

High juvenile mortality during migration in a declining population of a long-distance migratory raptor,"['Oppel, S', 'Dobrev, V', 'Arkumarev, V', 'Saravia, V', 'Bounas, A', 'Kret, E', 'Velevski, M', 'Stoychev, S', 'Nikolov, SC', 'AUTUMN MIGRATION']",IBIS,10.1111/ibi.12258,JUL 2015,1,"Many populations of long-distance migrants are declining and there is increasing evidence that declines may be caused by factors operating outside the breeding season. Among the four vulture species breeding in the western Palaearctic, the species showing the steepest population decline, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus, is a long-distance migrant wintering in Africa. However, the flyways and wintering areas of the species are only known for some populations, and without knowledge of where mortality occurs, effective conservation management is not possible. We tracked 19 juvenile Egyptian Vultures from the declining breeding population on the Balkan Peninsula between 2010 and 2014 to estimate survival and identify important migratory routes and wintering areas for this species. Mortality during the first autumn migration was high (monthly survival probability 0.75) but mortality during migration was exclusively associated with suboptimal navigation. All birds from western breeding areas and three birds from central and eastern breeding areas attempted to fly south over the Mediterranean Sea, but only one in 10 birds survived this route, probably due to stronger tailwind. All eight birds using the migratory route via Turkey and the Middle East successfully completed their first autumn migration. Of 14 individual and environmental variables examined to explain why juvenile birds did or did not successfully complete their first migration, the natal origin of the bird was the most influential. We speculate that in a declining population with fewer experienced adults, an increasing proportion of juvenile birds are forced to migrate without conspecific guidance, leading to high mortality as a consequence of following sub-optimal migratory routes. Juvenile Egyptian Vultures wintered across a vast range of the Sahel and eastern Africa, and had large movement ranges with core use areas at intermediate elevations in savannah, cropland or desert. Two birds were shot in Africa, where several significant threats exist for vultures at continental scales. Given the broad distribution of the birds and threats, effective conservation in Africa will be challenging and will require long-term investment. We recommend that in the short term, more efficient conservation could target narrow migration corridors in southern Turkey and the Middle East, and known congregation sites in African wintering areas."
Temporally unpredictable supplementary feeding may benefit endangered scavengers,"['Arrondo, E', 'Cortes-Avizanda, A', 'Donazar, JA']",IBIS,10.1111/ibi.12267,JUL 2015,0,"The monitoring of an experimental feeding station established in northernSpainallowed the evaluation of how this type of resource, predictable in space but not in time, was exploited by a guild of avian scavengers in relation to factors such as season, hour of disposal and presence of the dominant species. The presence of Egyptian Vultures Neophron percnopterus at carcasses was more likely during spring, and richness and diversity of avian scavengerswas lower during the summer and when Griffon Vultures Gyps fulvus arrived earlier. The temporal unpredictability of the resource may favour exploitation by smaller and less competitive scavengers. New European regulations may present an opportunity to develop effective conservation measures to support functional scavenger assemblages."
Dynamic integration of sustainability indicators in insular socio-ecological systems,"['Banos-Gonzalez, I', 'Martinez-Fernandez, J', 'Esteve-Selma, MA']",ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.08.014,JUN 24 2015,1,"The sustainability assessment on socio-ecological systems requires a systemic perspective in order to address the close relationships between the environmental and socio-economic processes. This need is especially urgent in the case of arid insular systems where limiting factors, as land and water resources, are more evident. The hyperarid island of Fuerteventura (The Canary Islands, Spain) represents a challenging case due to the need for compatibilizing the rising tourist development with the sustainable management of its natural resources, highly vulnerable due to processes such as the degradation of natural habitats which hosts endemic and endangered species - or the high dependence of allocthonous energy sources for basic processes, including water supply.

In this work we present an integral dynamic model, the Fuerteventura sustainability model (FSM), tested and calibrated for 1996-2011 period. The FSM allows to understand the main components of this socio-ecological system and their changes along time, as well as the interaction between the included sustainability indicators and other factors within the system. Results have shown the existence of potential trade-offs not only between socioeconomic development and conservation options, but also between sustainability goals under different management options. The conservation of the Houbara habitat might require the elimination of traditional agro-systems restoration plans, although these agro-systems offer important environmental functions. Besides, a reduction of cattle herd in order to control the degradation of high quality vegetation might negatively affect the endangered population of scavengers on the island. The water-energy binomial offers another trade-off regarding sustainable development, due to the strong dependency of the water availability on energy consumption. In this sense, the FSM has shown to be a useful tool to improve the comprehensive diagnosis of the system and to identify trade-offs between sustainability indicators to orientate management policies for this insular socio-ecological system.

"Temporal and spatial avian community composition in urban landscapes of the Bengaluru region, India","['Rajashekara, S', 'Venkatesha, MG']",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY,NA,MAY 2015,0,"A study was undertaken to know the abundance, diversity and species richness of bird communities in urban landscapes of Bengaluru region, India. One hundred and eighteen species of birds belonging to 43 families under 78 genera was documented. Of them, Gyps indicus, Neophron percnopterus and Parus nuchalis were critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable species. Among 19 landscapes, the mean population density (number of birds seen/km') was highest at Bannerghatta National Park and lowest at Kempegowda Bus Station. Species diversity, species evenness and richness of bird communities were significantly different between landscapes. Seasonal occurrence of bird species was not significantly different. The mean population density of birds was positively correlated with tree density and negatively correlated with canopy coverage, human population density and buildings."
"Manipulating size, amount and appearance of food inputs to optimize supplementary feeding programs for European vultures","['Moreno-Opo, R', 'Trujillano, A', 'Arredondo, A', 'Gonzalez, LM', 'Margalida, A']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2014.10.022,JAN 2015,3,"Supplementary feeding is one of the most common techniques used to alleviate threats to scavengers species related to the quality and availability of food resources. Because supplementary feeding may have undesired effects, the management of supplementary sites should be optimized from an ecological and conservation perspective. We installed high-resolution videocameras at six Spanish feeding stations recording more that 7500 h of observations at 105 feeding events. We analyzed food preferences in the four European vulture species (Eurasian griffon vulture Gyps fulvus, Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, bearded vulture Gypaetus barbatus and cinereous vulture Aegypiys rnonachus) as they relate to the characteristics of the food remains and carcasses provided at feeding sites. Our results suggest that carrion features (format, scattering, prey species, biomass and items) influence differential selection between species and age-classes. At a species level, large inputs of unscattered carrion increased the abundance of actively feeding griffon vultures. The ratio of the abundance of bearded vultures, Egyptian vultures and cinereous vultures with respect to griffon vultures was favored when less biomass was supplied and when the food provided was not presented as whole carcasses. Thus, using medium-size ungulates (i.e. sheep and goat) presented as small, abundant and scattered pieces favors the consumption of the resource by the most endangered species. Our findings can be used to optimize the supplementary provisioning of vultures in cases where this conservation tool is considered essential for managing targeted species or population groups.

"Trichomonas gypaetinii n. sp., a new trichomonad from the upper gastrointestinal tract of scavenging birds of prey","['Martinez-Diaz, RA', 'Ponce-Gordo, F', 'Rodriguez-Arce, I', 'del Martinez-Herrero, MC', 'Gonzalez, FG', 'Molina-Lopez, RA', 'Gomez-Munoz, MT']",PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH,10.1007/s00436-014-4165-5,JAN 2015,1,"In the context of an epidemiological study carried out by several wildlife recovery centers in Spain, trichomonads resembling Trichomonas gallinae were found in the oropharyngeal cavity of 2 Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) and 14 cinereous vultures (Aegypius monachus) which did not show any symptoms of trichomonosis. In order to characterize them, these isolates along with seven other T. gallinae isolates obtained from different hosts and from different geographical origin were analyzed. Genetic analyses were performed by sequencing the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA) and the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and the 5.8S rRNA regions. The morphological study of the isolates in both light and scanning electron microscopy was also performed. The sequences obtained in the genetic analysis coincide with previously published sequences of an isolate named as Trichomonas sp., obtained from a bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), and showed clear differences to the T. gallinae sequences (97 and 90-91 % homology, respectively, for SSU-rRNA and ITS regions) and display higher similarity with Trichomonas vaginalis and Trichomonas stableri than with T. gallinae. Multivariate statistical analysis of the morphometric study also reveals significant differences between the trichomonads of vultures and the isolates of T. gallinae. The isolates from vultures presented smaller values for each variable except for the length of axostyle projection, which was higher. These results together with the different nature of their hosts suggest the possibility of a new species of trichomonad which we hereby name Trichomonas gypaetinii, whose main host are birds of the subfamily Gypaetinae."
Testing problem solving in turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) using the string-pulling test,"['Ellison, AM', 'Watson, J', 'Demers, E']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-014-0782-8,JAN 2015,1,"To examine problem solving in turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), six captive vultures were presented with a string-pulling task, which involved drawing a string up to access food. This test has been used to assess cognition in many bird species. A small piece of meat suspended by a string was attached to a perch. Two birds solved the problem without apparent trial-and-error learning; a third bird solved the problem after observing a successful bird, suggesting that this individual learned from the other vulture. The remaining birds failed to complete the task. The successful birds significantly reduced the time needed to solve the task from early trials compared to late trials, suggesting that they had learned to solve the problem and improved their technique. The successful vultures solved the problem in a novel way: they pulled the string through their beak with their tongue, and may have gathered the string in their crop until the food was in reach. In contrast, ravens, parrots and finches use a stepwise process; they pull the string up, tuck it under foot, and reach down to pull up another length. As scavengers, turkey vultures use their beak for tearing and ripping at carcasses, but possess large, flat, webbed feet that are ill-suited to pulling or grasping. The ability to solve this problem and the novel approach used by the turkey vultures in this study may be a result of the unique evolutionary pressures imposed on this scavenging species."

Extinction of the globally endangered Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus breeding in SE Bulgaria,"['Milchev, B', 'Georgiev, V']",NORTH-WESTERN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,NA,DEC 2014,1,"The breeding distribution and productivity of the last Egyptian vultures in SE Bulgaria has been studied since 1990. The 13 known localities declined to four by 2000 and no territory has been occupied since 2006. The breeding productivity was below population replacement rate. Clutches with addle eggs were the most important natural factor for decreased breeding success. The frequency of addled eggs increased significantly following the decrease in livestock production. Breeding success rate decreased significantly with this change, but increase in unsuccessful breeding attempts happened due to poaching. Principal losses from human causes were destruction of the nests containing eggs, and shooting to the youngs and to the bird's pairs. The shooting led to 50% extirpation (n=6) of the known nesting sites in the Strandzha Mountains. Actions undertaken to protect pairs based on the National Nature Protection Legislation were not sufficient to save the Egyptian vulture. Construction of the artificial nests and follow-up monitoring were the only actions with positive impact on the breeding population."

Host species in which the parasite has not been previously analysed by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing in Spain are also reported: Columba palumbus, Streptopelia turtur, Pica pica, A. gentilis, Accipiter nisus, Asio otus, Bubo bubo, Buteo buteo, Circus aeruginosus, Circus cyaneus, Falco naumanni, Falco peregrinus, Neophron percnopterus, Otus scops, Pernis apivorus and Strix aluco. Sequence analysis of the ITS1/5.8S/ITS2 region revealed five different genotypes and also some mixed infections. A relationship between genotype and host species was observed, but only two genotypes (ITS-OBT-Tg-1and ITS-OBT-Tg-2) were widely distributed. Genotype ITS-OBT-Tg-1 was most frequently found in predator birds and statistically associated with pathognomonic lesions. Non-strict ornithophagous species were at higher risk to develop disease than ornithophagous ones. Genotypes ITS-OBT-Tcl-1 and ITS-OBT-Tcl-2 are new reports, and ITS-OBT-Tvl-5 is reported for the first time in Spain. They showed higher genetic homology to Trichomonas canistomae and Trichomonas vaginalis than to Trichomonas gallinae, indicating the possibility of new species within this genus."
Effective conservation measures to mitigate the impact of human disturbances on the endangered Egyptian vulture,"['Zuberogoitia, I', 'Zabala, J', 'Martinez, JE', 'Gonzalez-Oreja, JA', 'Lopez-Lopez, P']",ANIMAL CONSERVATION,10.1111/acv.12107,OCT 2014,1,"A consistent body of literature suggests that migratory species, ecological specialists and/or populations living on the borders of their distribution ranges are expected to be among the most seriously affected by alterations in environmental conditions. In this framework, we tested the combined effects of human disturbance and weather conditions on the breeding performance of a long-lived endangered scavenger, the Egyptian vulture, in a study area (Biscay, northern Spain) located close to the edge of its worldwide range. Furthermore, we tested the effect of specific management strategies aimed at preventing the impact of human disturbance on the species' breeding output. Our results showed that the breeding success was negatively correlated with weather conditions, mainly rainfall and number of rainy days in June, that is the rearing period of small nestlings. Importantly, human disturbance was the main factor affecting Egyptian vultures' productivity. In fact, during the study period (2000-2012), we detected cases of high-level disturbance in 59 nests (30.9%) within 17 of the 22 monitored territories, which only produced three fledglings overall. In 2010, we started the application of management actions for preventing human disturbance, first in a few control territories and later, in 2011 and 2012, across the whole study area. The measures were found to be successful, as the breeding success increased to levels similar to those previously detected in non-disturbed nests. Our results showed that management strategies aimed at preventing human disturbance are of paramount importance in order to assure the conservation of this endangered species."
"Congregations of wintering Egyptian Vultures Neophron percnopterus in Afar, Ethiopia: present status and implications for conservation","['Arkumarev, V', 'Dobrev, V', 'Abebe, YD', 'Popgeorgiev, G', 'Nikolov, SC']",OSTRICH,10.2989/00306525.2014.971450,OCT 2014,1,"The Endangered Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus congregates in communal roosts in the wintering areas and where food availability is high, where even a single threat might lead to substantial population declines. Thus, more research on the congregation sites is needed for timely detection of threats and effectively directed conservation measures. We studied bird numbers, use of roosting substrates and roosting habitat of wintering Egyptian Vultures in Ethiopia. Vultures were counted using the road-count technique in 2009, 2010 and 2013 along c. 600 km of roads in the Afar region. Over 1 000 individuals were counted each year and the sites with the highest congregations were identified. Nearly half of the birds were adults and the majority roosted on bird-safe types of electric pylons. Most of the Egyptian Vultures were found below 500 m above sea level, in bare areas, open savannas or grasslands, and their abundance was negatively related to the amount of cover of bush vegetation. The distribution of roosting birds was not affected by distance to human settlements. To avoid disasterous effects on the population of the Egyptian Vultures, we strongly recommend that the sites sheltering the highest numbers of roosting birds should be included in the Important Bird Area network, the use of poisons should be banned, and dangerous power lines should be insulated or substituted with safer types."
Individual repeatability in timing and spatial flexibility of migration routes of trans-Saharan migratory raptors,"['Lopez-Lopez, P', 'Garcia-Ripolles, C', 'Urios, V']",CURRENT ZOOLOGY,NA,OCT 2014,11,"Satellite-tracking technology has allowed scientists to make a quantum leap in the field of migration ecology. Nowadays, the basic description of migratory routes of many species of birds has been reported. However, the investigation of bird migration at individual level (i.e. repeatability in migratory routes and timing) still remains seldom explored. Here, we investigated repeated migratory trips of a trans-Saharan endangered migratory raptor, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus, tracked by GPS satellite telemetry. We compared between-and within-individual variation in migratory routes and timing in order to assess the degree of repeatability (or conversely, the flexibility) in migration. To this end, we analysed a dataset of 48 trips (23 springs and 25 autumns) recorded for six adult birds during 2007-2013. Our results showed consistent migration timing at the individual level, both in spring and autumn. Interestingly, there was a high degree of flexibility in the routes followed by the same individual in different years, probably due to variations in meteorological conditions. Contrary to expectations of a faster migration in spring than in autumn owing to a time-minimization strategy for breeding, birds spent less time in autumn migration (13 +/- 2 days, range = 9-18 d) than in spring migration (19 +/- 3 days, range = 13-26 d), which can be explained by differences in environmental conditions en route. Egyptian vultures showed a consistent clockwise loop migration through western Africa, following more easterly routes in autumn than in spring. Finally, our results provide supporting evidence of low phenotypic plasticity in timing of migration (i.e. strong endogenous control of migration) and high flexibility in routes"
Have population declines in Egyptian Vulture and Red-headed Vulture in India slowed since the 2006 ban on veterinary diclofenac?,"['Galligan, TH', 'Amano, T', 'Prakash, VM', 'Kulkarni, M', 'Shringarpure, R', 'Prakash, N', 'Ranade, S', 'Green, RE', 'Cuthbert, RJ']",BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL,10.1017/S0959270913000580,SEP 2014,3,"Populations of three vulture species of the genus Gyps, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus and Red-headed Vulture Sarcogyps calvus have declined markedly on the Indian subcontinent since the mid-1990s and all are now Critically Endangered or Endangered. Gyps vultures have been killed by the widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, ingested when they feed on carcasses of domesticated ungulates treated with the drug shortly before death. However, it is not known whether Egyptian Vulture and Red-headed Vulture are also sensitive to diclofenac. Veterinary use of diclofenac was banned in India in 2006. Since then, the prevalence and concentration of diclofenac in domesticated ungulates carcasses has decreased and population declines of Gyps vultures have slowed or reversed. Here, we examine counts of Egyptian and Red-headed Vultures obtained on road transects in and near protected areas between 1992 and 2011. We found indications that the declines in both species appear to have slowed and possibly increased after the ban was introduced, though the small numbers of birds counted make this conclusion less robust than that for the Gyps species. These results suggest that both species may have been adversely impacted by diclofenac and that government bans on this drug, which are beginning to take effect, may benefit a wider range of vulture species in the Indian subcontinent than was previously thought."
Phenotypic and Genotypic Characterization of Klebsiella Pneumoniae Obtained from Egyptian Vultures and Steppes Eagles from India,"['Sharma, SK', 'Sharma, P', 'Shringi, BN']",ISRAEL JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE,NA,SEP 2014,0,"Wild migrating Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus percnopterus) and Steppes eagles (Aquila nipalensis) can potentially harbor and spread pathogenic microorganisms and may associated with antibiotic resistance genes over long distances. In the present study, we reported the prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae from feces of wild Egyptian vultures and Steppes eagles, which were sampled for two consecutive winter seasons, at a carcass dump in the state of Rajasthan India, and to the best knowledge of the authors as a first record from the Indian subcontinent. After phenotypic characterization and genotypic confirmation based on 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region showing a prevalence of 11% (n=27), and these isolates displayed resistance to multiple antibiotics including beta-lactams, glycopeptides, macrolides, polypeptides and sulfonamides groups. All isolates were screened for virulence associated serotypes K1, K2 and K5 with serotype specific primers and the potentially pathogenic K5 serotype was confirmed in one isolate obtained from an Egyptian vulture. Occurrence of multiple antibiotic resistance and K5 serotype of K. pneumoniae in endangered Egyptian vultures, and steppe eagles requires further investigations in the context of epidemiology and pathogenicity of K. pneumoniae including concerning effects on population health and conservation context of these scavenging raptors."
Food predictability determines space use of endangered vultures: implications for management of supplementary feeding,"['Lopez-Lopez, P', 'Garcia-Ripolles, C', 'Urios, V']",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,NA,JUL 2014,6,"Understanding space use of free-living endangered animals is key to informing management decisions for conservation planning. Like most scavengers, vultures have evolved under a context of unpredictability of food resources (i.e., exploiting scattered carcasses that are intermittently available). However, the role of predictable sources of food in shaping spatial ecology of vultures has seldom been studied in detail. Here, we quantify the home range of the Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus), a long-lived raptor that has experienced severe population decline throughout its range and is qualified as endangered worldwide. To this end, six adults were tracked by satellite telemetry in Spain during the breeding season, from 2007 to 2012, recording 10 360 GPS locations. Using Resource Utilization Functions, we assessed the topology of the Utilization Distribution, a three-dimensional measure that shows the probability of finding an animal within the home range. Our results showed how food availability, and principally, how food predictability, determines ranging behavior of this species. Egyptian Vultures showed consistent site fidelity across years, measured as the two-and three-dimensional overlap in their home ranges. Space use varied considerably within the home range and remarkably, places located far from nesting sites were used more frequently than some areas located closer. Therefore, traditional conservation measures based on establishing restrictive rules within a fixed radius around nesting sites could be biologically meaningless if other areas within the home range are not protected too. Finally, our results emphasize the importance of anthropogenic predictable sources of food (mainly vulture restaurants) in shaping the space use of scavengers, which is in agreement with recent findings. Hence, measures aimed at ensuring food availability are essential to preserve this endangered vulture, especially in the present context of limiting carrion dumping in the field due to sanitary regulations according to European legislation."
Allometric deviations of plasma carotenoids in raptors,"['Blanco, G', 'Bautista, LM', 'Hornero-Mendez, D', 'Lambertucci, SA', 'Wiemeyer, G', 'Sanchez-Zapata, JA', 'Hiraldo, F', 'Donazar, JA']",IBIS,10.1111/ibi.12155,JUL 2014,0,"Because large species ingest proportionally less food than small ones, it may be predicted that they should incorporate relatively fewer carotenoids to a proportionally equal volume of blood. However, some species may increase their levels of circulating carotenoids by ingesting unusual food. We tested whether the plasma concentration of carotenoids scales to the three-quarter power of mass in nine predatory and scavenger raptor species. No significant allometric relationships were found due to the unusually high concentrations of carotenoids in the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus and the Andean condor Vultur gryphus. To assess whether these two species deviate from the allometric rule through the exploitation of unusual sources of carotenoids, or due to a physiological adaptation to improve the uptake of carotenoids, we determined allometric patterns in individuals of these two species kept in captivity with an exclusive diet of flesh. Our results provided support for the allometric rule because the slope of the allometric equation did not differ from a three-quarter exponent when carotenoid levels of the two outliers were replaced by those of captive birds. This adjustment to the allometric rule suggests a lack of any physiological adaptation to improve the uptake of the low concentrations of carotenoids contained in flesh. Differences between species in carotenoid incorporation into the bloodstream may be ultimately due to contrasting evolutionary history, physiology and associated colour-signalling strategies, but proximately due to the acquisition of these micronutrients from both usual and unusual dietary sources."
Long-term population decrease and recent breeding performance of the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus in Macedonia,"['Grubac, B', 'Velevski, M', 'Avukatov, V']",NORTH-WESTERN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,NA,JUN 2014,4,"The distribution, population size and breeding density of the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus in Macedonia have been studied in two periods, 1983-1991 and 2003-2011. Results show that its population experienced decline of about 83% for the period of 30 years, counting only 22-23 pairs in 2011. The decrease has been steepest for the period 1991-2002 (-60.4%), and is mostly owing to single mass poisoning incident. Based on the overlap of the home ranges, breeding territories were grouped in clusters, and were non-randomly distributed within the clusters. Within the largest cluster, the nearest neighbor distance has significantly increased between the beginning and end of the study (from 2668.88 m to 7231.74 m in averages), and breeding density fell from 1.29 to 0.60 pairs/100 km(2). Breeding parameters (2006-2011) were similar to the previous studies - productivity (0.84 +/- 0.2), breeding success (0.93 +/- 0.2) and the fledging rate (1.19 +/- 0.16). Poisoning is considered as the primary reason for population decrease, and posed the most serious threat for the breeding population. It was also noted that some of the pairs do not return to the breeding territories, indicating possible losses along migration routes and/or in wintering regions. Urgent conservation measures are needed to safeguard the species in Macedonia, primarily by restricting the use of poison baits, which are the most important non-natural mortality factor."
Towards the identification of a new taphonomic agent: An analysis of bone accumulations obtained from modern Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) nests,"['Serra, AS', 'Margalef, CR', 'Perez, JVM', 'Ripoll, MP', 'Cunat, CT', 'Marco, YC', 'Jorda, GP', 'Gomez, AR', 'Marques, JB', 'Bonilla, VV']",QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL,10.1016/j.quaint.2013.10.047,APR 30 2014,1,"This paper presents the results of a study of bones recovered in various current Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) nests in a Mediterranean region of the Iberian Peninsula. The Egyptian vulture, a diurnal, scavenging, rupicolous bird of prey, is one of four vulture species that currently inhabit the Iberian Peninsula. An analysis of the remains found in the nests confirms that it has a heterogeneous diet that includes remains from human activities (butchery and food production) and the carcasses of dead animals, although it is possible that they also prey on small-sized taxa. The taphonomic study determines these birds' capability of transporting, accumulating and altering bone remains. Some of the elements show marks caused by beak and/or claw impacts brought about primarily during feeding, which have characteristic typologies. Despite the fact that this is not a bone-eating vulture, it can also be seen that some bones are swallowed. The characteristics of the bone set studied here are important for establishing the origin of bone accumulations on archaeological sites. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved."
The role of the Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus) as a bone accumulator in cliff rock shelters: an analysis of modern bone nest assemblages from North-eastern Iberia,"['Lloveras, L', 'Nadal, J', 'Moreno-Garcia, M', 'Thomas, R', 'Anglada, J', 'Baucells, J', 'Martorell, C', 'Vilasis, D']",JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE,10.1016/j.jas.2014.01.018,APR 2014,5,"The Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus) is one of the smallest vultures in the Old World. Today, this vulture is seasonal in Europe, spending winter in North Africa and returning to Europe in spring; however, some permanent populations reside in the south of the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands. These birds feed mainly on carrion but are opportunistic and will prey on small mammals, birds and reptiles. The remains of Egyptian Vultures have been found on archaeological sites dated to the Pleistocene and Holocene, raising the possibility that they may have been active bone accumulating agents in caves and shelters, a practice evidenced by contemporary observation. Taphonomic studies on prey remains consumed by this vulture are very scarce and its role as an agent responsible for bone accumulations on archaeological sites is not fully understood. In this paper, we analyse bone remains recovered from three well known Egyptian Vulture nests situated in cliff rock shelters from Osona and Ripolles regions (Northeast Spain) with the aim of characterising their accumulations. Specifically, we detail taxonomic and anatomical representation, bone breakage, beak marks and digestion damage. Results show that very diverse taxonomic groups can be accumulated in Egyptian Vulture nest assemblages. The anatomical representation pattern varies greatly depending on the size of prey. Skeletal remains show a low degree of fragmentation and digestion, whilst the proportion of beak marked bones is high. Comparisons with other agents of bone accumulation (birds of prey and terrestrial mammalian carnivores) reveal that the taphonomic signature of Egyptian Vultures differs from most predators.

Population Viability Analysis of the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus in Macedonia and Implications for Its Conservation,"['Velevski, M', 'Grubac, B', 'Tomovic, L']",ACTA ZOOLOGICA BULGARICA,NA,MAR 2014,1,"We used VORTEX 9.99 to run 21 simulations on the viability of the population of the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus in Macedonia. Our baseline scenario indicated that there is a high probability of total extinction of the Egyptian Vulture from Macedonia within 50 years, with mean and median time periods to first extinctions being 26 and 25 years, respectively. Productivity rates have little influence on the persistence of the population, and conservation actions should be focused on reduction in the mortality rate not only in the breeding regions but also along the migration routes and in the wintering quarters. The possible supplementation of population would be justified only if the programme is accomplished together with some in-situ conservation measures. The number of the released juveniles in such a programme will have a clear effect on the viability of the population. Further research is urgently needed in order to identify the migration routes and wintering areas of the birds that breed or fledge in Macedonia, as well as to determine the actual mortality rates among the different age classes, since our results have indicated that the numbers used in this study may be considered too optimistic. Great care in planning of the future infrastructural and touristic development of the country and more efforts to control the illegal use of poison are also needed in order to protect the Egyptian Vulture from extinction in Macedonia. Currently, the species should be considered as Critically Endangered at national level."
Living in risky landscapes: delineating management units in multithreat environments for effective species conservation,"['Olea, PP', 'Mateo-Tomas, P']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,10.1111/1365-2664.12176,FEB 2014,3,"Managing threatened species to reduce their extinction risk is a widely used, yet challenging, means of halting biodiversity loss. Species show complex spatial patterns of extinction risk, due to spatial variation in both threats and vulnerability across their ranges. Conservation practitioners, however, rarely consider this spatial variation and routinely apply uniform conservation schemes, either throughout the species' ranges, or following administrative borders that do not match ecological boundaries. Most of these schemes are experience-based (e.g. expert opinion) and thus difficult to replicate. We accounted for spatial variation in species' threats by using multivariate techniques [i.e. cluster analyses and multidimensional scaling (MDS)] to delineate management units for more effective conservation. We grouped breeding territories of the endangered Egyptian vulture, according to interterritory similarity in presence and intensity of their threats. The first three MDS axes explained 62% of the data variation. The first axis separated territories in protected areas, with low human presence, but high risk of illegal poisoning from areas highly dominated by humans. The second axis classified territories regarding the density of sheep/goats and griffon vultures and the presence of wind farms. The third axis confronted territories in protected areas with those in unprotected areas with wind farms. We obtained 18 statistically supported groups (i.e. management units) including 86% of the territories. Territories within the same group were geographically close, agreeing with the underlying spatial autocorrelation of threats. However, six groups (33%) were distributed over more than one administrative region, which will require inter-regional coordination for cost-effective conservation.Synthesis and applications. Our results show wide spatial variation for species' threats and suggest incorporation of this heterogeneity into conservation schemes. We demonstrate how multivariate statistics, coupled with uncertainty analysis, can be employed in a systematic and repeatable way to deal with the heterogeneous landscapes of risk that species face across their ranges. Our approach allows researchers and managers to delineate management units according to similarity in species' threats for any targeted organization level (e.g. individuals, territories, populations). The results can be visualized in Euclidean and geographical spaces for better interpretation, allowing managers to design more effective conservation actions.

The importance of Besh Barmag bottleneck (Azerbaijan) for Eurasian migrant birds,"['Heiss, M', 'AUTUMN']",ACTA ORNITHOLOGICA,10.3161/000164513X678900,WIN 2013,0,"Migrating birds are known to avoid topographical barriers. At these barriers, the local environmental conditions often lead to a high concentration of migrants at certain corridors or points usually referred to as 'bottlenecks'. The Greater Caucasus and the Caspian Sea are such barriers for migrating birds in south-western Asia. A narrow coastal plain between the Greater Caucasus and the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan (Besh Barmag bottleneck) provides excellent conditions for studying bird migration of a poorly known region. Here, surveys were carried out in autumn 2011 and spring 2012 to count raptor, passerine and waterbird migration from three different observation points. Data for fixed block of six hours continual observations together with random counting hours have been interpolated by a special calculation to obtain estimated grand totals per species. In total, 278 bird species were recorded, eight of which are red-listed as globally threatened by the IUCN (i.e. Sociable Lapwing Vanellus gregarius, White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala, Saker Falcon Falco cherrug, Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus, Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus, Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus, Eastern Imperial Eagle Aquila heliaca, Greater Spotted Eagle Aquila clanga), another eight as 'near threatened'. Calculations indicated 1.24-1.51 million visible migrants in autumn 2011 and 0.65-0.82 million in spring 2012. For four species (Eurasian Skylark Alauda arvensis, Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris, Rosy Starling Sturnus roseus, Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax), the mean passage estimates exceeded 100,000 individuals. 15 species meet or are well within the range of the criterion of 1% of the world population. For a further 19 species they exceed the criterion of 1% of the flyway population. Dalmatian Pelican and Little Bustard were observed in great numbers representing 33-57% and 41-48% of the world population, respectively. Both species and, additionally, raptor and waterbird migration are discussed. The results presented here serve to underline the importance of Azerbaijan for migrating bird species in general, and to highlight in particular the great potential of the study area as a location for long-term monitoring studies in a remote and little-studied region."
"Who Are We Feeding? Asymmetric Individual Use of Surplus Food Resources in an Insular Population of the Endangered Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus
","['Garcia-Heras, MS', 'Cortes-Avizanda, A', 'Donazar, JA']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0080523,NOV 11 2013,6,"Supplementary feeding stations, or ""vulture restaurants"", are common conservation management tools. While a number of studies have investigated the consequences of surplus food on the population dynamics of scavengers, relatively little is known about the effects of such practices at the individual level. Within the long-term monitored breeding population of Canarian Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus majorensis) we investigated individual bird's patterns of use of a supplementary feeding station at Fuerteventura (Canary Islands), over the course of breeding (2001, 2002; 2004-2011) and non-breeding seasons (2000-2010). Our results show that during the breeding season the individual use of the supplementary feeding station was inversely related to the distance to the breeding territory, which suggests the existence of central-place foraging constraints. In addition, larger birds of poor body-condition and individuals that ultimately failed to fledge young were detected more frequently at the feeding station. During the non-breeding season, and because most breeding birds abandoned the breeding territories, the overall abundance of Egyptian vultures at the feeding station grew. Moreover, the only variable increasing the probability of presence of individuals was poor body condition so that birds with lower wing residual visited the feeding station more frequently. Supplementary feeding may benefit individuals who would otherwise have been subject to selective pressures. From our results it follows that this conservation strategy must be used with caution because it can have consequences on an individual level and thus potentially affect the viability of endangered populations."
Reinventing mutualism between humans and wild fauna: insights from vultures as ecosystem services providers,"['Gangoso, L', 'Agudo, R', 'Anadon, JD', 'de la Riva, M', 'Suleyman, AS', 'Porter, R', 'Donazar, JA']",CONSERVATION LETTERS,10.1111/j.1755-263X.2012.00289.x,JUN 2013,4,"In parallel with economic and social changes, mutualism in human-vulture relations has virtually disappeared worldwide. Here, we describe the mutualistic relationship between humans and the globally threatened Egyptian vulture in Socotra, Yemen. By analyzing both the spatial distribution of vultures and the amount of human byproducts they consume, we show that human activities enable the maintenance of the densest population of this rare scavenger, whereas vultures provide a key regulating service by disposing of up to 22.4% of the organic waste annually produced in towns. Globalization is impacting the archipelago, and therefore policies that better integrate societal needs and biodiversity conservation are urgently needed. We propose a win-win solution that relies on the restructuring of the mutualism, shifting from regulating services toward cultural services. Our study highlights the necessity of reconciling trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and economic development in a framework of global change affecting Middle Eastern countries."
Stressful conditions experienced by endangered Egyptian vultures on African wintering areas,"['Carrete, M', 'Bortolotti, GR', 'Sanchez-Zapata, JA', 'Delgado, A', 'Cortes-Avizanda, A', 'Grande, JM', 'Donazar, JA']",ANIMAL CONSERVATION,10.1111/acv.12001,JUN 2013,8,"Among European breeding birds, those wintering in the Sahel region have undergone a sustained and severe decline. Long-term data show that variation in primary production of the Sahelian staging area significantly affects survival of many species, a relationship probably mediated by trophic resource availability. However, the physiological, hormonal and behavioural responses underlying this relationship remain unexplored. We present a potential explanation for the importance of prevailing conditions during winter to understand the population ecology and current trends of migratory species. We measured corticosterone levels in feathers of Egyptian vultures Neophron percnopterus grown in Africa and Europe, showing how conditions faced by birds during wintering periods result in the release of more corticosterone over time than when those individuals were on their summering grounds. This pattern was concordant with home-range size differences (c. 33 times larger in Africa than in Europe). We suggest that as wintering habitat of Egyptian vultures in the Sahel region has degraded during recent times, food availability has also been reduced. An increase in corticosterone during winter with a consequent increase in locomotor activity, for example, food searching behaviour, may normally be adaptive. However, enlarging home ranges could be futile if conditions are not better in the dispersal area, and costs of the higher corticosterone level, including energy expenditure from enhanced activity, may pose a significant trade-off. These physiological responses may be characteristic of other European trans-Saharan migrant birds that have undergone significant population declines."
Sex Determination in 58 Bird Species and Evaluation of CHD Gene as a Universal Molecular Marker in Bird Sexing,"['Vucicevic, M', 'Stevanov-Pavlovic, M', 'Stevanovic, J', 'Bosnjak, J', 'Gajic, B', 'Aleksic, N', 'Stanimirovic, Z']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21010,MAY-JUN 2013,3,"The aim of this research was to test the CHD gene (Chromo Helicase DNA-binding gene) as a universal molecular marker for sexing birds of relatively distant species. The CHD gene corresponds to the aim because of its high degree of conservation and different lengths in Z and W chromosomes due to different intron sizes. DNA was isolated from feathers and the amplification of the CHD gene was performed with the following sets of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers: 2550F/2718R and P2/P8. Sex determination was attempted in 284 samples of 58 bird species. It was successful in 50 bird species; in 16 of those (Alopochen aegyptiacus, Ara severus, Aratinga acuticaudata, Bucorvus leadbeateri, Cereopsis novaehollandiae, Columba arquatrix, Corvus corax, C. frugilegus, Cyanoliseus patagonus, Guttera plumifera, Lamprotornis superbus, Milvus milvus, Neophron percnopterus, Ocyphaps lophotes, Podiceps cristatus, and Poicephalus senegalus), it was carried out for the first time using molecular markers and PCR. It is reasonable to assume that extensive research is necessary to define the CHD gene as a universal molecular marker for successful sex determination in all bird species (with exception of ratites).

Evaluating the Connectivity of a Protected Areas' Network under the Prism of Global Change: The Efficiency of the European Natura 2000 Network for Four Birds of Prey,"['Mazaris, AD', 'Papanikolaou, AD', 'Barbet-Massin, M', 'Kallimanis, AS', 'Jiguet, F', 'Schmeller, DS', 'Pantis, JD']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0059640,MAR 19 2013,8,"Climate and land use changes are major threats to biodiversity. To preserve biodiversity, networks of protected areas have been established worldwide, like the Natura 2000 network across the European Union (EU). Currently, this reserve network consists of more than 26000 sites covering more than 17% of EU terrestrial territory. Its efficiency to mitigate the detrimental effects of land use and climate change remains an open research question. Here, we examined the potential current and future geographical ranges of four birds of prey under scenarios of both land use and climate changes. By using graph theory, we examined how the current Natura 2000 network will perform in regard to the conservation of these species. This approach determines the importance of a site in regard to the total network and its connectivity. We found that sites becoming unsuitable due to climate change are not a random sample of the network, but are less connected and contribute less to the overall connectivity than the average site and thus their loss does not disrupt the full network. Hence, the connectivity of the remaining network changed only slightly from present day conditions. Our findings highlight the need to establish species-specific management plans with flexible conservation strategies ensuring protection under potential future range expansions. Aquila pomarina is predicted to disappear from the southern part of its range and to become restricted to northeastern Europe. Gyps fulvus, Aquila chrysaetos, and Neophron percnopterus are predicted to locally lose some suitable sites; hence, some isolated small populations may become extinct. However, their geographical range and metapopulation structure will remain relatively unaffected throughout Europe. These species would benefit more from an improved habitat quality and management of the existing network of protected areas than from increased connectivity or assisted migration."
Persistent electrocution mortality of Egyptian Vultures Neophron percnopterus over 28 years in East Africa,"['Angelov, I', 'Hashim, I', 'Oppel, S']",BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL,10.1017/S0959270912000123,MAR 2013,11,"Electrocution on poorly designed power poles is increasingly shown to pose a threat for the populations of many large raptors. Here we document that a power line in Sudan continues to cause mortality of Egyptian Vultures Neophron percnopterus, a problem that was first identified in 1984. We suggest that this power line may have caused the death of sufficient Egyptian Vultures to partially explain population declines in the Middle East, from where the electrocuted birds may originate. This report highlights the urgent need to plan and retro-fit power lines in Africa with non-lethal support structures."
Scavengers on the Move: Behavioural Changes in Foraging Search Patterns during the Annual Cycle,"['Lopez-Lopez, P', 'Benavent-Corai, J', 'Garcia-Ripolles, C', 'Urios, V']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0054352,JAN 23 2013,16,"Background: Optimal foraging theory predicts that animals will tend to maximize foraging success by optimizing search strategies. However, how organisms detect sparsely distributed food resources remains an open question. When targets are sparse and unpredictably distributed, a Levy strategy should maximize foraging success. By contrast, when resources are abundant and regularly distributed, simple Brownian random movement should be sufficient. Although very different groups of organisms exhibit Levy motion, the shift from a Levy to a Brownian search strategy has been suggested to depend on internal and external factors such as sex, prey density, or environmental context. However, animal response at the individual level has received little attention.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We used GPS satellite-telemetry data of Egyptian vultures Neophron percnopterus to examine movement patterns at the individual level during consecutive years, with particular interest in the variations in foraging search patterns during the different periods of the annual cycle (i.e. breeding vs. non-breeding). Our results show that vultures followed a Brownian search strategy in their wintering sojourn in Africa, whereas they exhibited a more complex foraging search pattern at breeding grounds in Europe, including Levy motion. Interestingly, our results showed that individuals shifted between search strategies within the same period of the annual cycle in successive years.

Conclusions/Significance: Results could be primarily explained by the different environmental conditions in which foraging activities occur. However, the high degree of behavioural flexibility exhibited during the breeding period in contrast to the non-breeding period is challenging, suggesting that not only environmental conditions explain individuals' behaviour but also individuals' cognitive abilities (e. g., memory effects) could play an important role. Our results support the growing awareness about the role of behavioural flexibility at the individual level, adding new empirical evidence about how animals in general, and particularly scavengers, solve the problem of efficiently finding food resources."
Lead toxicosis of captive vultures: case description and responses to chelation therapy,"['Pikula, J', 'Hajkova, P', 'Bandouchova, H', 'Bednarova, I', 'Adam, V', 'Beklova, M', 'Kral, J', 'Ondracek, K', 'Osickova, J', 'Pohanka, M', 'Sedlackova, J', 'Skochova, H', 'Sobotka, J', 'Treml, F', 'Kizek, R']",BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH,10.1186/1746-6148-9-11,JAN 16 2013,2,"Background: Lead, a serious threat for raptors, can hamper the success of their conservation. This study reports on experience with accidental lead intoxication and responses to chelation therapy in captive Cinereous (Aegypius monachus) and Egyptian (Neophron percnopterus) Vultures.

Results: Soil contamination by lead-based paint sanded off the steel aviary resulted in poisoning of eight Cinereous and two Egyptian Vultures. A male Egyptian Vulture developed signs of apathy, polydipsia, polyuria, regurgitation, and stupor, and died on the next day. Liver, kidney and blood lead concentrations were 12.2, 8.16 and 2.66 mu g/g, respectively. Laboratory analyses confirmed severe liver and kidney damage and anaemia. Blood Pb levels of Pb-exposed Cinereous Vultures were 1.571 +/- 0.510 mu g/g shortly after intoxication, decreased to 0.530 +/- 0.165 mu g/g without any therapy in a month and to 0.254 +/- 0.097 mu g/g one month after CaNa(2)EDTA administration. Eight months later, blood lead levels decreased to close to the background of the control group. Blood parameters of healthy Pb-non-exposed Cinereous Vultures were compared with those of the exposed group prior to and after chelation therapy. Iron levels in the lead-exposed pre-treatment birds significantly decreased after chelation. Haematocrit levels in Pb-exposed birds were significantly lower than those of the controls and improved one month after chelation. Creatine kinase was higher in pre-treatment birds than in the controls but normalised after therapy. Alkaline phosphatase increased after chelation. A marked increase in the level of lipid peroxidation measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive species was demonstrated in birds both prior to and after chelation. The ferric reducing antioxidant power was significantly lower in pre-treatment vultures and returned to normal following chelation therapy. Blood metallothionein levels in lead-exposed birds were higher than in controls. Reduced glutathione dropped after CaNa2EDTA therapy, while oxidised glutathione was significantly lower in both pre- and post-treatment birds. A chick in an egg produced by a Cinereous Vulture female two months after lead toxicosis died on day 40 of artificial incubation. Lead concentrations in foetal tissues were consistent with levels causing avian mortality.

Conclusions: The reported blood parameters and reproduction impairment in captive birds may have implications for professionals dealing with lead exposure in wild birds."

Diet of the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) after livestock reduction in Eastern Bulgaria,"['Milchev, B', 'Spassov, N', 'Popov, V']",NORTH-WESTERN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,NA,DEC 2012,3,"The diet of six Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus breeding pairs has been studied in E Bulgaria since the sharp decline of livestock husbandry. The feeding range was based on 1694 remains and included mainly mammals (67.5% +/- 7.3), birds (15.6% +/- 4.9) and reptiles (14.3% +/- 5.6). Domesticated mammals comprised 46.7% +/- 10.5 (range 31.8-58.2%) of the total diet, and wild mammals 20.8% +/- 14.7 (range 9.0-44.9%). When livestock numbers decreased in the Strandzha Mountains, the share. of livestock carrion and carnivore prey remains dropped in the vultures' diet. Vultures feeding shifted to scale reptiles. The occurrence of wild animals in vulture's diets differed between years, but the importance of domestic animals remained relatively constant (range 53.5-67.2%). Human food remains were the Main origin of livestock's bones (up to 87.5%). By contrast, in the open habitats of Mt Sakar and nearby the town of Varna, Egyptian vultures took more frequently carnivores and wild birds, and less ungulates and scale reptiles. An important part of the diet is formed by the small and medium sized wild animals, but overall their utilization was low. Young tortoises were taken alive to only one nest. The changes in the food availability and subsequent changes in diets were not the decisive factor for the extinction of the Egyptian vulture in the Strandzha Mountains and Mt Sakar."
Genetic diversity at neutral and adaptive loci determines individual fitness in a long-lived territorial bird,"['Agudo, R', 'Carrete, M', 'Alcaide, M', 'Rico, C', 'Hiraldo, F', 'Donazar, JA']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rspb.2011.2606,AUG 22 2012,16,"There is compelling evidence about the manifest effects of inbreeding depression on individual fitness and populations' risk of extinction. The majority of studies addressing inbreeding depression on wild populations are generally based on indirect measures of inbreeding using neutral markers. However, the study of functional loci, such as genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), is highly recommended. MHC genes constitute an essential component of the immune system of individuals, which is directly related to individual fitness and survival. In this study, we analyse heterozygosity fitness correlations of neutral and adaptive genetic variation (22 microsatellite loci and two loci of the MHC class II, respectively) with the age of recruitment and breeding success of a decimated and geographically isolated population of a long-lived territorial vulture. Our results indicate a negative correlation between neutral genetic diversity and age of recruitment, suggesting that inbreeding may be delaying reproduction. We also found a positive correlation between functional (MHC) genetic diversity and breeding success, together with a specific positive effect of the most frequent pair of cosegregating MHC alleles in the population. Globally, our findings demonstrate that genetic depauperation in small populations has a negative impact on the individual fitness, thus increasing the populations' extinction risk."

Colonies possessed the typical fried-egg appearance and electron micrographs revealed a pleomorphic cellular morphology with the lack of a cell wall. The isolates hydrolysed arginine and required sterol for growth but did not ferment glucose or hydrolyse urea.

In this study, whole-blood samples taken from 25 apparently healthy griffon vultures at various stages of maturity were examined to investigate whether the vultures are being excessively exposed to environmental contaminants that might deleteriously affect their reproduction. Five groups of environmental contaminants, comprising toxic elements, organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and perfluorinated compounds, were monitored in dried blood spots. Results of the analyses showed low levels of exposure of griffon vultures to environmental contaminants compared with the sparse data available on griffon vultures and other diurnal raptors in other countries."
"Long-term relationship between diet breadth and breeding success in a declining population of Egyptian Vultures Neophron percnopterus
","['Margalida, A', 'Benitez, JR', 'Sanchez-Zapata, JA', 'Avila, E', 'Arenas, R', 'Donazar, JA']",IBIS,10.1111/j.1474-919X.2011.01189.x,JAN 2012,15,"Between 2000 and 2009 we studied the diet and breeding success of Egyptian Vultures Neophron percnopterus in southern Spain. Wild species accounted for 74.9% of prey items (n = 1071) with a predominance of mammals (62.3%), followed by birds (20.8%) and reptiles (13.1%). Spatially, the diet was highly varied and not restricted to carcasses of livestock; wild Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus accounted for 54% of the overall remains. The spatial variability may reflect regional and local disparity in the availability of main prey. The temporal relationship between variation in trophic diversity and Vulture nesting productivity (both values showing a long-term decrease) might suggest a causal link between variation in diet and reproductive output. We hypothesize that high turnover rates could explain productivity variation as a consequence of the recruitment of less experienced individuals to the breeding population. This could in turn generate covariation between diet and reproductive output."
"Integrating effects of supplementary feeding, poisoning, pollutant ingestion and wind farms of two vulture species in Spain using a population viability analysis","['Garcia-Ripolles, C', 'Lopez-Lopez, P']",JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY,10.1007/s10336-011-0671-8,OCT 2011,9,"Population viability analyses (PVAs) are a useful technique in risk-assessment studies aimed at determining which demographic parameters are most influential in population persistence. Here, we incorporate demographic and environmental stochasticity in the construction of individual-based models integrating the effects of different scenarios in a PVA of the Eurasian Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus) and the endangered Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus) in Spain. Scenarios were based on reasonable options of population management, including effects of supplementary feeding (decreasing mortality and increasing fecundity), extensive wind farm development (increasing mortality), and catastrophic events such as poisoning (decreasing fecundity and survival) or pollutant ingestion (decreasing fecundity but no effect on survival). Our results show that those measures affecting survival show higher negative effects on population growth rate than those affecting fecundity. The outcomes were different and highly depend on the initial conditions and the species considered, with stronger negative effects on Egyptian Vulture populations. For both species, under similar conditions, the effects of massive poisoning, even occurring at low time frequency, had stronger negative consequences in population trends than the pollutant accumulation, or other actions affecting survival, such as installation of wind farms. Measures aimed at improving survival and fecundity such as supplementary feeding at vulture restaurants give rise to positive population trends. The establishment of management actions aimed at improving the birds' survival and increasing breeding success will probably boost the scavengers' populations into an upward trend, which is particularly important in the case of the endangered Egyptian Vulture."
Microsatellite based ovine parentage testing to identify the source responsible for the killing of an endangered species,"['Rendo, F', 'Iriondo, M', 'Manzano, C', 'Estonba, A']",FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL-GENETICS,10.1016/j.fsigen.2010.09.009,AUG 2011,4,"In this study, we present an animal forensic genetics case in which we applied ovine microsatellite based parentage testing to the resolution of an act against protected wildlife. The aim was to identify the origin of the animal responsible for the death of an Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) that had been poisoned through consumption of a Latxa Blond Face breed lamb. Thus, we carried out a 22 microsatellite based parentage test in order to identify the parents of the lamb in the flock which grazes in the same place where the vulture's remains were found. Multiple parentage analysis revealed two possible parents, one ewe and one ram, with a combined paternity/maternity index (PI) higher than 9.09E9 and a likelihood (W) value of 99.9999%, assuming 50% probability a priori. This result confirmed the flock of origin of the poisoned lamb and shows that the microsatellite panel described herein is a potentially useful tool for the resolution of animal forensic cases.

"Spatially explicit estimation of occupancy, detection probability and survey effort needed to inform conservation planning","['Olea, PP', 'Mateo-Tomas, P']",DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,10.1111/j.1472-4642.2011.00777.x,JUL 2011,16,"Aim It is increasingly recognized the importance of accounting for imperfect detection in species distribution modelling and conservation planning. However, the integration of detectability into a spatially explicit frame has received little attention. We aim (1) to show how to develop distribution maps of both detection probability and survey effort required to reliably determine a species presence/absence and (2) to increase awareness of the spatial variation of detection error inherent in studies of species occurrence.

Location North-western Spain.

Methods We registered the presence/absence of the endangered Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) in 213 surveys performed in 40 of 104 territories once known to be occupied. We model simultaneously both detection probability and occurrence, using site occupancy modelling. With the resulting regression equations, we developed distribution maps of both detection probability and required sampling effort throughout the area.

Results Of the studied territories, 72.5% were detected as occupied, but after accounting for imperfect detection, the proportion of sites truly occupied was 79%. Detectability decreased in territories with higher topographical irregularity and increased with both the time of day of the survey and the progress of the season. Spatial distribution of detectability showed a mainly north-south gradient following the distribution of slope in the area. The likelihood of occupancy increased with rockier, less forested surface and less topographical irregularity within the territory. A minimum of five surveys, on average, are needed to assess, with 95% probability, the occupancy status of a site, ranging from <= 3 to > 24 visits/territory depending on survey-and site-specific features.

Main conclusions Accounting for detectability and its sources of variation allows us to elaborate distribution maps of detectability-based survey effort. These maps are useful tools to reliably assess (e.g. with 95% probability) occupancy status throughout a landscape and provide guidance for species conservation planning."
"POPULATION ESTIMATES FOR THE DIVERSE RAPTOR ASSEMBLAGE OF DADIA NATIONAL PARK, GREECE","['Poirazidis, K', 'Schindler, S', 'Kakalis, E', 'Ruiz, C', 'Bakaloudis, DE', 'Scandolara, C', 'Eastham, C', 'Hristov, H', 'Catsadorakis, G']",ARDEOLA,NA,JUN 2011,6,"Population estimates for the diverse raptor assemblage of Dadia National Park, Greece. Dadia National Park, which is situated in north-eastern Greece, close to the border with Bulgaria and Turkey, is characterised by one of the most diverse arrays of breeding raptorial species in Europe. The first raptor survey was undertaken in the 1970s, but until 1999 most surveys were circumstantial and nonsystematic. Considering some of these species are globally endangered and included in Annex 1 of the Birds Directive, and that raptors in general are considered key indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem health, a systematic raptor monitoring programme was established by WWF Greece in 2000. This paper presents the results of this programme including the population status, trends and breeding densities of raptors from 2001 to 2005. Some 18-19 species bred in the area regularly, at densities ranging from one pair per 100 km(2) (e.g. long-legged buzzard Bute rufinus and peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus) to 30 pairs per 100 km(2) (common buzzard Buteo buteo). The total number of raptor territories was stable with an average of 321 +/- 15.5 territories (77 territories/100 km(2)) with no overall trend and little fluctuation. Although the population size has increased for several species since the mid 1990s, data from the first surveys in the 1970s suggest that some species are still recovering from the decline suffered in the 1980s. The populations of six species have remained stable since the 1970s, whilst five species, including the Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, have shown a gradual decline. The black vulture Aegypius monachus was the only species with a confirmed increase, a further three species showing a probable increase. The long-term trend for four species, including the common buzzard, is unknown due to insufficient data from the 1970s."
Major histocompatibility complex variation in insular populations of the Egyptian vulture: inferences about the roles of genetic drift and selection,"['Agudo, R', 'Alcaide, M', 'Rico, C', 'Lemus, JA', 'Blanco, G', 'Hiraldo, F', 'Donazar, JA']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05107.x,JUN 2011,17,"Insular populations have attracted the attention of evolutionary biologists because of their morphological and ecological peculiarities with respect to their mainland counterparts. Founder effects and genetic drift are known to distribute neutral genetic variability in these demes. However, elucidating whether these evolutionary forces have also shaped adaptive variation is crucial to evaluate the real impact of reduced genetic variation in small populations. Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are classical examples of evolutionarily relevant loci because of their well-known role in pathogen confrontation and clearance. In this study, we aim to disentangle the partial roles of genetic drift and natural selection in the spatial distribution of MHC variation in insular populations. To this end, we integrate the study of neutral (22 microsatellites and one mtDNA locus) and MHC class II variation in one mainland (Iberia) and two insular populations (Fuerteventura and Menorca) of the endangered Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus). Overall, the distribution of the frequencies of individual MHC alleles (n = 17 alleles from two class II B loci) does not significantly depart from neutral expectations, which indicates a prominent role for genetic drift over selection. However, our results point towards an interesting co-evolution of gene duplicates that maintains different pairs of divergent alleles in strong linkage disequilibrium on islands. We hypothesize that the co-evolution of genes may counteract the loss of genetic diversity in insular demes, maximize antigen recognition capabilities when gene diversity is reduced, and promote the co-segregation of the most efficient allele combinations to cope with local pathogen communities."
Set a thief to catch a thief: brown-necked raven (Corvus ruficollis) cooperatively kleptoparasitize Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus),"['Yosef, R', 'Kabesa, S', 'Yosef, N']",NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN,10.1007/s00114-011-0777-0,MAY 2011,2,"Our study describes how brown-necked ravens (Corvus ruficollis) are able to take advantage of an ordinarily inaccessible, high-quality food source by relying upon their innovative and manipulative thinking capabilities to exploit methods used by Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) to overcome the problem. In five observed interactions, the ravens were first seen in the vicinity of an abandoned clutch of ostrich eggs (Struthio camelus). The area was frequented by a pair of Egyptian vultures that bred on the cliffs across the road from the nature reserve. The Egyptian vulture exhibits tool use in birds, and is able to crack the hard shells of ostrich eggs by lifting a rock in the beak and pounding at the egg till it breaks open or cracks. If the egg is only cracked, the vulture inserts its narrow bill into the fissure and widens it by opening the mandibles. Pieces of eggshell are removed from around the crack in order to further open the egg. This is the point at which the pair of ravens attacked the vulture and harassed it till it abandoned the egg and left the area. The ravens then jointly enjoyed the contents of the egg which was otherwise inaccessible to them because of the strong egg shell."
Status assessment of raptors in Cape Verde confirms a major crisis for scavengers,"['Hille, SM', 'Collar, NJ', 'MILVUS-MILVUS-FASCIICAUDA']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605310000682,APR 2011,3,"Scavenging raptors have been postulated to be declining at a rate far higher than predatory raptors. To test this hypothesis we reviewed the historical and present status of the seven raptor species-three scavengers (two kites and a vulture), one partial scavenger (a buzzard) and three species (osprey and two falcons) that take live prey-that breed on the Cape Verde islands. Scavenging raptors have experienced steeper declines and more local extinctions than non-scavengers in Cape Verde, with the partial scavenger midway between the two groups. Causes of scavenger decline include incidental poisoning, direct persecution and declines in the availability of carcasses and other detritus. These findings, which highlight the conservation importance of the island of Santo Antao, indicate the priority that needs to be accorded to scavengers, particularly in Europe where many insular populations are reaching unsustainable levels."
On the evolutionary and ontogenetic origins of tool-oriented behaviour in New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides),"['Kenward, B', 'Schloegl, C', 'Rutz, C', 'Weir, AAS', 'Bugnyar, T', 'Kacelnik, A']",BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01613.x,APR 2011,8,"New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides) are prolific tool users in captivity and in the wild, and have an inherited predisposition to express tool-oriented behaviours. To further understand the evolution and development of tool use, we compared the development of object manipulation in New Caledonian crows and common ravens (Corvus corax), which do not routinely use tools. We found striking qualitative similarities in the ontogeny of tool-oriented behaviour in New Caledonian crows and food-caching behaviour in ravens. Given that the common ancestor of New Caledonian crows and ravens was almost certainly a caching species, we therefore propose that the basic action patterns for tool use in New Caledonian crows may have their evolutionary origins in caching behaviour. Noncombinatorial object manipulations had similar frequencies in the two species. However, frequencies of object combinations that are precursors to functional behaviour increased in New Caledonian crows and decreased in ravens throughout the study period, ending 6 weeks post-fledging. These quantitative observations are consistent with the hypothesis that New Caledonian crows develop tool-oriented behaviour because of an increased motivation to perform object combinations that facilitate the necessary learning.

Defining favourable reference values for bird populations in Italy: setting long-term conservation targets for priority species,"['Brambilla, M', 'Gustin, M', 'Celada, C']",BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL,10.1017/S0959270910000407,MAR 2011,7,"Setting favourable reference values (FRV) for conservation targets may help in assessing the conservation status of species and habitats. FRVs should be expressed through population size or demographic parameters that are likely to ensure the long-term persistence of a species across its range. We developed a conceptual framework for defining FRVs for Italian birds included in Annex I of the European Union's Wild Birds Directive 79/409/CEE. The approach was based on demographic trends, current population size and the minimum viable population concept. We subdivided bird species according to abundance at the national scale, spatial distribution in discrete isolated populations and/or biogeographic categories. FRVs based on population viability analysis (PVA) were provided for populations of less than 2,500 pairs. For species with more than 2,500 pairs and a wide, more or less continuous range, the FRV was expressed in terms of breeding density at different spatial scales for non-colonial species. Out of the 88 species considered, we were able to formulate FRVs based on PVA for 47 populations belonging to 21 species, and breeding density for 15 further species; lack of adequate data prevented us from defining FRVs for the remaining species. Further work should focus on the translation of FRV density values into population size and on the definition of reference values for range and habitat."
Distribution of persistent organochlorine chemical residues in blood plasma of three species of vultures from India,"['Dhananjayan, V', 'Muralidharan, S', 'Jayanthi, P']",ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,10.1007/s10661-010-1424-5,FEB 2011,8,"The presence of persistent organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined in blood plasma of white-backed vulture Gyps bengalensis, Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, and griffon vulture Gyps fulvus collected from Ahmedabad, India. All the samples had varying levels of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs. Statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences among species were detected for beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (5-HCH), HCH, and dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT). The mean concentration of HCH, EDDT, and EPCBs among plasma ranged from 43.7 to 136, 8.8 to 64.8, and 226 to 585 ng/ml, respectively. Among the various OCPs analyzed, 1,1-dichloro2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE) was detected most frequently. The concentrations of cyclodiene insecticides detected were lower than the other organochlorine residues. The levels of pesticides measured in plasma samples of three species of vulture were comparable to the results documented for a number of avian species and were lower than those reported to have deleterious effects on survival or reproduction of birds. Although no threat is posed by any of the organochlorine pesticides detected, continuous monitoring of breeding colonies is recommended. This study is also the first account of a comprehensive analysis of toxicants present in blood plasma of vulture species in India. The values reported in this study can serve as guidelines for future research in general as well as control values during the analysis of samples obtained from birds in the event of suspected organochlorine poisoning."

Evidence of connectivity between continental and differentiated insular populations in a highly mobile species,"['Agudo, R', 'Rico, C', 'Hiraldo, F', 'Donazar, JA']",DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00724.x,JAN 2011,9,"Aim

Genetically differentiated insular populations are candidates for independent units for conservation. However, occasional immigration to reduced island populations may occur and potentially have important consequences in their future viability and evolutionary potential. In this study, we investigate the conservation implications of population structure and connectivity of insular and continental populations of a migratory raptor as determined using genetic tools and satellite tracking.

Western European populations in the Iberian Peninsula and two insular populations in the Mediterranean Sea (Balearic Islands) and Atlantic Ocean (Canary Islands).

Methods

We genotyped 22 microsatellite loci in 96 Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) from the Iberian Peninsula, 36 from Menorca (Balearic archipelago) and 242 (85% of the current population) from Fuerteventura (Canary Islands). We analysed genetic variation to estimate structure, gene flow, genetic diversity, effective size and recent demographic history of the populations. Additionally, 19 vultures were marked with satellite transmitters to track their migration routes.

Results

Insular populations were genetically differentiated from those of the mainland. We detected immigration in the insular populations and within the continental counterpart. We found similar levels of genetic variability between the continent and the islands, and a bottleneck analysis indicated recent sharp population declines in both archipelagos but not on the continent.

Main conclusions

Our study provides evidence that, in spite of significant differentiation, insular populations of highly mobile species may remain connected with the mainland. Conservation programmes should take into account population connectivity and integrate differentiated units of management within complex units of conservation that can best maintain processes and potential for evolutionary change."
The role of humans in the diversification of a threatened island raptor,"['Agudo, R', 'Rico, C', 'Vila, C', 'Hiraldo, F', 'Donazar, JA']",BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1186/1471-2148-10-384,DEC 13 2010,11,"Background: Anthropogenic habitat modifications have led to the extinction of many species and have favoured the expansion of others. Nonetheless, the possible role of humans as a diversifying force in vertebrate evolution has rarely been considered, especially for species with long generation times. We examine the influence that humans have had on the colonization and phenotypic and genetic differentiation of an insular population of a long-lived raptor species, the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus).

Results: The morphological comparison between the Canarian Egyptian vultures and the main and closest population in Western Europe (Iberia) indicated that insular vultures are significantly heavier (16%) and larger (about 3%) than those from Iberia. Bayesian and standard genetic analyses also showed differentiation (F(ST) = 0.11, p < 0.01). The inference of changes in the effective size of the Canarian deme, using two likelihood-based Bayesian approaches, suggested that the establishment of this insular population took place some 2500 years ago, matching the date of human colonization. This is consistent with the lack of earlier fossils.

Conclusions: Archaeological remains show that first colonizers were Berber people from northern Africa who imported goats. This new and abundant food source could have allowed vultures to colonize, expand and adapt to the island environment. Our results suggest that anthropogenic environmental change can induce diversification and that this process may take place on an ecological time scale (less than 200 generations), even in the case of a long-lived species."
FIRST CASE OF ALBINISM IN EGYPTIAN VULTURES,"['Cortes-Avizanda, A', 'Ceballos, O', 'Urmeneta, A', 'Donazar, JA']",JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH,10.3356/JRR-10-12.1,DEC 2010,1,NA
"Diclofenac Residues in Blood Plasma and Tissues of Vultures Collected from Ahmedabad, India","['Muralidharan, S', 'Dhananjayan, V']",BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY,10.1007/s00128-010-0109-7,OCT 2010,2,"The study reports residues of diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug, in tissues of 11 White-backed Vulture, Gyps bengalensis collected between 2005 and 2007 and blood plasma of 12 White-backed Vulture, four Egyptian Vulture, Neophron percnopterus and two Griffon Vulture, Gyps fulvus collected during 2005. Samples were analysed using High Performance Liquid Chromatograhy (HPLC) equipped with UV detector. One of the White-backed Vultures collected during 2005 had substantial urate deposits on its viscera and diclofenac was detected in its liver (1.42 ppm wet weight) and kidney (1.18 ppm wet weight), which is suggestive of diclofenac exposure and intoxication. Although uric acid crystals were not observed in the remaining birds received during 2005, the residues of diclofenac detected were at levels higher than the toxic limits (0.25-1 ppm). No residues were detected in any of the tissues of birds collected during 2006 and 2007 (6 birds). About 89% (16 of 18) of plasma samples collected during 2005 had diclofenac residues (White-backed vulture: BDL to 0.17 ppm; Egyptian vulture: BDL to 0.09 ppm; Griffon vulture: 0.07-0.14 ppm). However, plasma diclofenac concentrations were less than the concentrations reported to be toxic. Although use of diclofenac for treating cattle has been banned in India, regular monitoring is recommended to assess the effectiveness of the ban on the drug in support of the conservation of these species."
Anticipating Knowledge to Inform Species Management: Predicting Spatially Explicit Habitat Suitability of a Colonial Vulture Spreading Its Range,"['Mateo-Tomas, P', 'Olea, PP', 'AUTOCORRELATION']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0012374,AUG 25 2010,10,"Background: The knowledge of both potential distribution and habitat suitability is fundamental in spreading species to inform in advance management and conservation planning. After a severe decline in the past decades, the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) is now spreading its breeding range towards the northwest in Spain and Europe. Because of its key ecological function, anticipated spatial knowledge is required to inform appropriately both vulture and ecosystem management.

Methodology/Findings: Here we used maximum entropy (Maxent) models to determine the habitat suitability of potential and current breeding distribution of the griffon vulture using presence-only data (N = 124 colonies) in north-western Spain. The most relevant ecological factors shaping this habitat suitability were also identified. The resulting model had a high predictive performance and was able to predict species' historical distribution. 7.5% (similar to 1,850 km(2)) of the study area resulted to be suitable breeding habitat, most of which (similar to 70%) is already occupied by the species. Cliff availability and livestock density, especially of sheep and goats, around 10 km of the colonies were the fundamental factors determining breeding habitat suitability for this species.

Conclusions/Significance: Griffon vultures could still spread 50-60 km towards the west, increasing their breeding range in 1,782 km(2). According to our results, 7.22% of the area suitable for griffon vulture will be affected by wind farms, so our results could help to better plan wind farm locations. The approach here developed could be useful to inform management of reintroductions and recovery programmes currently being implemented for both the griffon vulture and other threatened vulture species."
Dietary shifts in two vultures after the demise of supplementary feeding stations: consequences of the EU sanitary legislation,"['Donazar, JA', 'Cortes-Avizanda, A', 'Carrete, M']",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,10.1007/s10344-009-0358-0,AUG 10 2010,30,"Among vertebrates, specialization in scavenging has appeared only in ""true"" Gyps vultures, which usually base their diet almost exclusively on carcasses of medium and large-sized mammals, whereas all other scavengers rely on broader ranges of prey. The availability of food for scavengers in Western Europe has not been limited during recent decades permitting the existence and growth of huge vulture populations. From 2000 onwards, however, EU sanitary legislation has progressively limited the abandonment of dead animals in the field resulting in a sudden reduction of food availability with unknown ecological and conservation consequences. Here, we examine the dietary response of a tandem of carrion eaters, the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) and the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), showing different degrees of dietary specialization. Our results showed that after the reduction in numbers of supplementary feeding stations (vulture restaurants) the niche breadth of the griffon vulture has broadened and now includes significant amounts of wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and garbage. The diet of the Egyptian vulture, on the contrary, did not vary substantially. The diet overlap showed patterns probably conditioned by interspecific competition and the progressive exploitation of unpredictable carcasses. On a short-term scale, consequences for smaller scavengers could be negative due to the monopolization of resources by the dominant and much more abundant griffon vulture, however in the long-term all guild species would benefit from the exploitation of unpredictable carcasses, which could enhance the possibilities of coexistence."
Diagnosing the causes of territory abandonment by the Endangered Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus: the importance of traditional pastoralism and regional conservation,"['Mateo-Tomas, P', 'Olea, PP']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605310000189,JUL 2010,8,Identifying threats to declining species and prescribing ways of preventing their extinction are basic challenges for biodiversity conservation. We analysed the causes underlying the loss of territories of the Endangered Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus in a key population at the north-western edge of its distribution in Europe by developing multi-scale models that combined factors from nest site to landscape. We used generalized linear models and an information-theoretic approach to identify the optimal combination of scales and resolutions that could explain territorial abandonment. Those models combining nest-site and landscape scales considerably improved prediction ability compared to those considering only one scale. The best combined model had a high predictive ability (96.9% of correctly classified cases). Small cliffs at high altitudes in rugged areas with declining livestock (especially of sheep and goats) increased the likelihood of territory abandonment. Our findings highlight the importance of developing region-specific multi-scale models to determine reliably the factors driving territory loss and of designing effective conservation strategies accordingly. Conservation measures for the studied population should be developed at two spatial scales. At the smaller scale it is necessary to closely control nest sites to avoid direct disturbances. At a larger scale it is essential to implement policies that can support traditional pastoralism.
"Status of the Endangered Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus in the Cantabrian Mountains, Spain, and assessment of threats","['Mateo-Tomas, P', 'Olea, PP', 'Fombellida, I']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605310000505,JUL 2010,10,"The Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus is categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, as well as on the European and Spanish Red Lists. Spain is home to the most important breeding population of Egyptian vultures in Europe but this population has differing trends at a regional scale. We present data for the Egyptian vulture population in the Cantabrian Mountains, north-west Spain, during the last 3 decades and assess the main threats to the species there. The Egyptian vulture population in the Cantabrian Mountains was estimated to be 175 breeding pairs in 2008, which comprised 13-14% of the Spanish population. This population has been stable, or increasing slightly, since 2000. During 2000-2008 4.3% of the Cantabrian Egyptian vulture population was affected by the use of illegal poison. During the same period the number of sheep and goats reared (which contributes to the maintenance of Egyptian vulture territories) was reduced by 27.4%, which could lead to food shortages for the vultures in the near future. Currently 32 breeding pairs (18.3% of the population) have wind turbines within their foraging areas, with an average of 59 wind turbines per territory (range 1-176). During the next few years this number will increase to 110 turbines per territory within 69 vulture territories (39.4% of the population). Nearly a third (32.6%) of breeding territories are located outside protected areas. Better coordination between administrative areas is needed to guarantee the conservation of the Cantabrian Mountains population of Egyptian vultures through effective surveillance and protection in the numerous existing protected areas."

A total of 2611 birds of prey, belonging to nine falconiform diurnal raptor and four strigiform species, were admitted. The Eurasian Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) and the Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) were the species most commonly admitted and jointly made tip 85.6% of admissions. The most frequent causes of admission to the wildlife rehabilitation center were collisions (with cars, high-voltage electric transmission towers, etc.; 42.2%), starvation (5.1%) and entanglement in glue traps intended for rodents (4.7%). Poisoning and shooting were recorded for 2.4 and 1.5% of the birds admitted, respectively. Only collisions increased during the study period. A total of 1010 birds (44.4% of the total) were released to the wild following rehabilitation. We recommend more financial support. for rehabilitation centers to develop detailed analytical diagnoses and rehabilitation services."

Large scale risk-assessment of wind-farms on population viability of a globally endangered long-lived raptor,"['Carrete, M', 'Sanchez-Zapata, JA', 'Benitez, JR', 'Lobon, M', 'Donazar, JA', 'PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2009.07.027,DEC 2009,57,"Wind-farms receive public and governmental support as an alternative energy source mitigating air pollution. However, they can have adverse effects on wildlife, particularly through collision with turbines. Research on wind-farm effects has focused on estimating mortality rates, behavioural changes or interspecific differences in vulnerability. Studies dealing with their effects on endangered or rare species populations are notably scarce. We tested the hypothesis that wind-farms increase extinction probability of long-lived species through increments in mortality rates. For this purpose, we evaluate potential consequences of wind-farms on the population dynamics of a globally endangered long-lived raptor in an area where the species maintains its greatest stronghold and wind-farms are rapidly increasing. Nearly one-third of all breeding territories of our model species are in wind-farm risk zones. Our intensive survey shows that wind-farms decrease survival rates of this species differently depending on individual breeding status. Consistent with population monitoring, population projections showed that all subpopulations and the meta-population are decreasing. However, population sizes and, therefore, time to extinction significantly decreased when wind-farm mortality was included in models. Our results represent a qualitative warning exercise showing how very low reductions in survival of territorial and non-territorial birds associated with wind-farms can strongly impact population viability of long-lived species. This highlights the need for examining long-term impacts of wind-farms rather than focusing on short-term mortality, as is often promoted by power companies and some wildlife agencies. Unlike other non-natural causes of mortality difficult to eradicate or control, wind-farm fatalities can be lowered by powering down or removing risky turbines and/or farms, and by placing them outside areas critical for endangered birds.

Poison-related mortality effects in the endangered Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) population in Spain,"['Hernandez, M', 'Margalida, A']",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,10.1007/s10344-009-0255-6,AUG 2009,46,"A total of 211 poisoning incidents registered over the period 1990-2007 and affecting 294 Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) were studied to address the impact of poison-related mortality in the Spanish population. Poison-related mortality mainly affected the birds on an individual level, with low numbers of individuals being found in each incident (mean 1.39) with 94.9% being adults. Deaths were largely recorded (81.8%) during the breeding season, with mortality peaking during May and June (52.1%). In contrast with other raptor species, a high proportion of adult individuals (74.2%) were found in the nest or its surroundings. Age-related differences in the poisoning rate are probably related with different feeding and behavioral strategies between age classes. The illegal use of poison to control predators was the main cause of mortality (93.8%), and particularly in small hunting reserves (74.9%), since the kind of food resources that adults exploit are coincident with the type of baits employed to illegally control predators and the preferred habitat coincides with areas of small game hunting. Our results suggest that poisoning is probably one of the main causes of Egyptian vulture mortality in Spain. The eradication of the illegal use of poisoning and supplementary feeding in specific territories to provide safe food seems priority for its conservation."
Combining scales in habitat models to improve conservation planning in an endangered vulture,"['Mateo-Tomas, P', 'Olea, PP']",ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,10.1016/j.actao.2009.03.004,JUL-AUG 2009,17,"Predictive modelling of species' distributions has been successfully applied in conservation ecology, but effective conservation requires predictive and accurate models. The combination of different scales to build habitat models might improve their predictive ability and hence their usefulness for conservation, but this approach has rarely been evaluated. We developed habitat-occupancy models combining scales from nest-site to landscape for a key population at the northwestern edge of the distribution of the globally endangered Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus). We used generalised linear models (GLM) and an information-theoretic approach to identify the best combination of scales and resolutions for explaining occurrence. Those models that combined nest-site and landscape scales improved the predictive ability compared with the scale-specific ones. The best combined model had a very high predictive ability when used against an independent dataset (92% correct classifications). Egyptian vultures preferred to nest in caves with vegetation at the entrance that were situated at the base of long cliffs, provided that these cliffs are embedded within low-lying, heterogeneous areas with little topographic irregularity and with little human disturbance. The density of sheep around the nest positively influenced Egyptian Vulture presence. Conservation of the studied population should focus on minimising human disturbance and on promoting sustainable development through conservation of traditional pastoralism. Our findings highlight the importance of developing region-specific multiscale models in order to design effective conservation strategies. The approach described here may be applied similarly in other Populations and species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."
Cellular and humoral immunodepression in vultures feeding upon medicated livestock carrion,"['Lemus, JA', 'Blanco, G']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rspb.2009.0071,JUN 22 2009,9,"Veterinary pharmaceuticals contained in dead livestock may be ingested by avian scavengers and negatively affect their health and consequently their population dynamics and conservation. We evaluated the potential role of antibiotics as immunodepressors using multiple parameters measuring the condition of the cellular and humoral immune system in griffon (Gyps fulvus), cinereous (Aegypius monachus) and Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus). We confirmed the presence of circulating antimicrobial residues, especially quinolones, in nestlings of the three vulture species breeding in central Spain. Individuals ingesting antibiotics showed clearly depressed cellular and humoral immune systems compared with nestlings from the control areas, which did not ingest antibiotics. Within central Spain, we found that individuals with circulating antibiotics showed depressed cellular (especially CD4(+) and CD8(+)T-lymphocyte subsets) and humoral (especially acellular APV complement and IL8-like) immune systems compared with nestlings without circulating antibiotics. This suggests that ingestion of antibiotics together with food may depress the immune system of developing nestlings, temporarily reducing their resistance to opportunistic pathogens, which require experimental confirmation. Medicated livestock carrion should be considered inadequate food for vultures due to their detrimental consequences on health derived from the ingestion and potential effects of the veterinary drugs contained in them and for this reason rejected as a management tool in conservation programmes."
Wind power plants and the conservation of birds and bats in Spain: a geographical assessment,"['Telleria, JL']",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,10.1007/s10531-008-9558-2,JUN 2009,14,"The number of wind power plants installed in Spain has increased dramatically, and many are located in important wildlife areas. This paper explores the geographical overlap of wind power plants with the ranges of flying vertebrate species. The list of animals studied includes bats, soaring birds, and other birds that may be killed by turbines. Results show that the 10 x 10 km UTM squares occupied by wind power plants fell within the range of more bat and bird species than squares free of these infrastructures. For species included in the Spanish Red List, there were more wind power plants than expected inside the range of two raptors (Neophron percnopterus and Circus pygargus) and less than expected in six species (Ciconia nigra, Aquila adalberti, Hieraetus fasciatus Myotis capaccinii, Rhinolophus mehelyi and Myotis myotis). The rest of endangered species (15) had a range occupation similar to that predicted by random sampling, a result that reflects a poor strategy to prevent the overlap. These patterns may be explained by the small amount of overlap of the range of many of these animals with the windiest areas in Spain, where wind power plants are concentrated today. However, this situation is changing rapidly with the densification and expansion of wind power plants promoted under the Spanish Plan of Renewable Energies. This may produce the occupation of many areas important to bird and bat conservation, and therefore preventive measures should be implemented to protect these species and their habitats."

Survival in a long-lived territorial migrant: effects of life-history traits and ecological conditions in wintering and breeding areas,"['Grande, JM', 'Serrano, D', 'Tavecchia, G', 'Carrete, M', 'Ceballos, O', 'Diaz-Delgado, R', 'Tella, JL', 'Donazar, JA']",OIKOS,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17218.x,APR 2009,55,"Despite its key role in population dynamics and evolutionary ecology, little is known about factors shaping survival in long-lived territorial species. Here, we assessed several hypotheses that might explain variability in survival in a migratory Spanish population of a long-lived territorial species, the Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, using a 16-year monitoring period and live-encounter histories of 835 individually marked birds. Cormack-Jolly-Seber capture-recapture models showed no evidence for effects of sex or nestling body condition on survival. However, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; an indicator of primary productivity) of natal territories had positive effects on juvenile survival, indicating that environmental conditions experienced early in life can determine survival prospects. Survival increased with age (0.73 +/- 0.02 in the first 2 years to 0.78 +/- 0.03 in years 3 and 4) to later decrease when birds were five years old (0.60 +/- 0.05), the age at which they acquire the adult plumage, abandon the communal lifestyle of juveniles, and may look for a breeding territory. At older ages, survival was higher for non-breeding (0.75 +/- 0.02) and breeding adults (0.83 +/- 0.02). Among the latter, birds that recruited into better territories had higher survival prospects. Age-specific variation in survival in this species may be related to behavioural changes linked to dispersal and recruitment into the breeding population, while survival prospects of adult birds strongly depend on breeding territory selection. These results suggest a tradeoff between recruiting soon, and thus reducing mortality costs of a long and extensive dispersal period, and trying to recruit into a good quality territory. Finally, annual survival rates for birds of all age classes were positively related with the NDVI in their African wintering grounds. Although this relationship was probably mediated by food availability, further research is needed to properly identify the limiting factors that are affecting trans-Saharan migrants, especially in light of global climate change."
LONG-TERM TRENDS IN POPULATION SIZE AND BREEDING SUCCESS IN THE EGYPTIAN VULTURE (NEOPHRON PERCNOPTERUS) IN NORTHERN SPAIN,"['Cortes-Avizanda, A', 'Ceballos, O', 'Donazar, JA']",JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH,10.3356/JRR-08-24.1,MAR 2009,16,"The Egyptian Vulture (Neophrorr percnopterus) is considered a globally endangered avian scavenger. In the 1980s, Bardenas Reales Natural Park in northern Spain held the densest populations in Europe. There, the population of the wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), the main prey of this culture, decreased dramatically after the arrival of the rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) in 1989, and did not recover. We monitored the population of Egyptian Vultures in Bardenas Reales from 1989-2007. During the study period, the number of breeding territories decreased front 56 to 26 (-54%). In contrast, the percentage of occupying pairs that laid eggs, the number of fledglings per pair, anti the number of fledglings per successful nest remained stable, suggesting that the population decline was not attributable to reduced productivity. However, we found 34 dead birds, most of them poisoned, particularly in III( second half of the study period (in 1996-1997 and 2004-2007), suggesting that high mortality rates could be contributing to the decline of this species. The fact that poisoning events mainly occurred outside the park suggested that the reduction in numbers of wild rabbits in Bardenas Reales Natural Park forced Egyptian Vultures to move into areas with greater human populations and higher mortality risks. We recommend implementing management measures and environmental education programs to prevent the illegal use of poisoned baits in the area surrounding the park."

In this paper we gain insights into the sublethal effects of lead contamination on Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus). Our approach was done on the comparison of two populations (Canary Islands and Iberian Peninsula) differing in exposures to the ingestion of lead ammunition. Blood lead levels were higher in the island population (Canary Islands range: 5.10-1780 mu g L(-1) n = 137; Iberian Peninsula range: 5.60-217.30 mu g L(-1) n = 32) showing clear seasonal trends, peaking during the hunting season. Moreover, males were more susceptible to lead accumulation than females. Bone lead concentration increased with age, reflecting a bioaccumulation effect. The bone composition was significatively altered by this contaminant: the mineralization degree decreased as lead concentration levels increased. These results demonstrate the existence of long-term effects of lead poisoning, which may be of importance in the declines of threatened populations of long-lived species exposed to this contaminant.

Effect of human activities on Egyptian vulture breeding success,"['Zuberogoitia, I', 'Zabala, J', 'Martinez, JA', 'Martinez, JE', 'Azkona, A']",ANIMAL CONSERVATION,10.1111/j.1469-1795.2008.00184.x,AUG 2008,18,"Habitat loss, electrocution on power poles and persecution by humans are the main threats to birds of prey. Nevertheless, the effects of human disturbance on endangered species are becoming notorious due to the increasing recreational use of the natural environment. We evaluated the effects of human disturbances on Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus breeding success and developed conservation measures based on minimum distance of effect and buffer areas in a high human density area of northern Spain. A total of 100 breeding attempts of 15 breeding pairs were monitored over 8 years. Human disturbances affected 42 of the breeding attempts. Those disturbances related to and originating in forestry work had the most severe effect on breeding success, being associated with the loss of 100% of 13 breeding attempts, while human disturbances related to free-time activities caused 44% failures in 25 breeding attempts by four pairs, two of them within Natural Parks. The breeding success was significantly less in territories affected by disturbances than in those free of disturbances. Some pairs affected by disturbances changed their nest site, increasing breeding success. Adults were prevented from entering the nest to feed chicks when anyone was detected at an average distance of 307 m, while an average distance of 837.5 m allowed them access. The maximum alert distance was estimated at 605 m and the buffer area was 57 ha. We discuss the application of our results for management schemes and conservation of this species."

We studied the effect of factors that vary both spatially and temporally on the nest site distribution of the Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus in northeast Portugal, and influence the population dynamics of these cliff-dwelling birds. Several demographic parameters were studied in the field, and the age structure of the population was determined. Additionally we investigated how food availability affected population fluctuations. The vulture population was most sensitive to juvenile mortality according to our model results. Our models showed that a decrease in the present food supply resulted in a decrease in vulture abundance and, moreover, negatively affected the spatial distribution of the species by decreasing the number of breeding pairs per colony. The total quantity of sheep and goat biomass, a greater distance to the nearest unpaved road, and the presence of Egyptian Vultures Neophron percnopterus at the breeding colonies showed a significant positive relationship to the numbers of Griffon Vulture breeding pairs. It is recommended that the available food supply in the most important foraging areas should be monitored and protected. Furthermore, to manage the community of cliff breeding raptors adequately, future research should identify and protect the most suitable breeding areas for each species. Human disturbance should be kept to a minimum by protecting breeding areas, especially in an area like Riba-Coa where species such as the Egyptian Vulture, Bonelli's Eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus and Griffon Vulture breed so close to each other."
Antibiotics Threaten Wildlife: Circulating Quinolone Residues and Disease in Avian Scavengers,"['Lemus, JA', 'Blanco, G', 'Grande, J', 'Arroyo, B', 'Garcia-Montijano, M', 'Martinez, F']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0001444,JAN 16 2008,35,"Antibiotic residues that may be present in carcasses of medicated livestock could pass to and greatly reduce scavenger wildlife populations. We surveyed residues of the quinolones enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics (amoxicillin and oxytetracycline) in nestling griffon Gyps fulvus, cinereous Aegypius monachus and Egyptian Neophron percnopterus vultures in central Spain. We found high concentrations of antibiotics in the plasma of many nestling cinereous (57%) and Egyptian (40%) vultures. Enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were also found in liver samples of all dead cinereous vultures. This is the first report of antibiotic residues in wildlife. We also provide evidence of a direct association between antibiotic residues, primarily quinolones, and severe disease due to bacterial and fungal pathogens. Our results indicate that, by damaging the liver and kidney and through the acquisition and proliferation of pathogens associated with the depletion of lymphoid organs, continuous exposure to antibiotics could increase mortality rates, at least in cinereous vultures. If antibiotics ingested with livestock carrion are clearly implicated in the decline of the vultures in central Spain then it should be considered a primary concern for conservation of their populations."
Isolation and characterization of 18 microsatellite loci in the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus),"['Agudo, R', 'Roques, S', 'Galarza, JA', 'Rico, C', 'Hiraldo, F', 'Donazar, JA']",CONSERVATION GENETICS,10.1007/s10592-007-9486-9,2008,4,"We developed 18 new microsatellite loci for the endangered Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus). Microsatellite loci were screened for variation in two different populations belonging to separate subspecies: the nominal N. p. percnopterus and the Canarian N. p. majorensis. Mean expected heterosygosities were respectively 0.51 and 0.46, while the mean number of alleles per locus was 4.7 and 3.9. These new markers allow further genetic studies for the endangered Canarian Egyptian Vulture."
