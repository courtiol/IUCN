Gorilla society: Conflict, compromise and cooperation between the sexes","['Brosnan, SF']",NATURE,10.1038/4501160a,DEC 20 2007,0,NA
The role of Pleistocene refugia and rivers in shaping gorilla genetic diversity in central Africa,"['Anthony, NM', 'Johnson-Bawe, M', 'Jeffery, K', 'Clifford, SL', 'Abernethy, KA', 'Tutin, CE', 'Lahm, SA', 'White, LJT', 'Utley, JF', 'Wickings, EJ', 'Bruford, MW']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0704816105,DEC 18 2007,88,"The role of Pleistocene forest refugia and rivers in the evolutionary diversification of tropical biota has been the subject of considerable debate. A range-wide analysis of gorilla mitochondrial and nuclear variation was used to test the potential role of both refugia and rivers in shaping genetic diversity in current populations. Results reveal strong patterns of regional differentiation that are consistent with refugial hypotheses for central Africa. Four major mitochondrial haplogroups are evident with the greatest divergence between eastern (A, B) and western (C, D) gorillas. Coalescent simulations reject a model of recent east-west separation during the last glacial maximum but are consistent with a divergence time within the Pleistocene. Microsatellite data also support a similar regional pattern of population genetic structure. Signatures of demographic expansion were detected in eastern lowland (B) and Gabon/Congo (D3) mitochondrial haplogroups and are consistent with a history of postglacial expansion from formerly isolated refugia. Although most mitochondrial haplogroups are regionally defined, limited admixture is evident between neighboring haplogroups. Mantel tests reveal a significant isolation-by-distance effect among western lowland gorilla populations. However, mitochondrial genetic distances also correlate with the distance required to circumnavigate intervening rivers, indicating a possible role for rivers in partitioning gorilla genetic diversity. Comparative data are needed to evaluate the importance of both mechanisms of vicariance in other African rainforest taxa."
"Investigation of the protein osteocalcin of Camelops hesternus: Sequence, structure and phylogenetic implications","['Humpula, JF', 'Ostrom, PH', 'Gandhi, H', 'Strahler, JR', 'Walker, AK', 'Stafford, TW', 'Smith, JJ', 'Voorhies, MR', 'Corner, RG', 'Andrews, PC']",GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA,10.1016/j.gca.2007.09.003,DEC 15 2007,7,"Ancient DNA sequences offer an extraordinary opportunity to unravel the evolutionary history of ancient organisms. Protein sequences offer another reservoir of genetic information that has recently become tractable through the application of mass spectrometric techniques. The extent to which ancient protein sequences resolve phylogenetic relationships, however, has not been explored. We determined the osteocalcin amino acid sequence from the bone of an extinct Camelid (21 ka, Camelops hesternus) excavated from Isleta Cave, New Mexico and three bones of extant camelids: bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus); dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) and guanaco (Llama guanacoe) for a diagenetic and phylogenetic assessment. There was no difference in sequence among the four taxa. Structural attributes observed in both modern and ancient osteocalcin include a post-translation modification, Hyp(9), deamidation of Gln(35) and Gln(39), and oxidation of Met(36). Carbamylation of the N-terminus in ancient osteocalcin may result in blockage and explain previous difficulties in sequencing ancient proteins via Edman degradation.

A phylogenetic analysis using osteocalcin sequences of 25 vertebrate taxa was conducted to explore osteocalcin protein evolution and the utility of osteocalcin sequences for delineating phylogenetic relationships. The maximum likelihood tree closely reflected generally recognized taxonomic relationships. For example, maximum likelihood analysis recovered rodents, birds and, within hominins, the Homo-Pan-Gorilla trichotomy. Within Artiodactyla, character state analysis showed that a substitution of Pro(4) for His(4) defines the Capra-Ovis clade within Artiodactyla. Homoplasy in our analysis indicated that osteocalcin evolution is not a perfect indicator of species evolution. Limited sequence availability prevented assigning functional significance to sequence changes. Our preliminary analysis of osteocalcin evolution represents an initial step towards a complete character analysis aimed at determining the evolutionary history of this functionally significant protein. We emphasize that ancient protein sequencing and phylogenetic analyses using amino acid sequences must pay close attention to post-translational modifications, amino acid substitutions due to diagenetic alteration and the impacts of isobaric amino acids on mass shifts and sequence alignments.

Habituation of western gorillas: The process and factors that influence it,"['Doran-Sheehy, DM', 'Derby, AM', 'Greer, D', 'Mongo, P']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20442,DEC 2007,19,"Habituation of western gorillas to human presence is generally an expensive, lengthy and difficult process. Here we describe the habituation process for two groups of western gorillas at the Mondika Research Center, with the hope that the lessons we learned will facilitate future gorilla studies. We expand upon earlier studies by describing the process through complete habituation for both males and females, and for more than one group. The major obstacle to habituation was developing sufficient tracking skills to follow gorilla trail on a daily basis. Once this was achieved, the silverback became semi-habituated (i.e. ignoring human presence during half of contacts) within a year, although the majority of group females continued to avoid humans. As female presence at contacts increased, a period of male recidivism followed, requiring an additional year before his complete habituation was reached. Habituating the females took longer than the male, but we found, contrary to earlier studies, that it consisted of the same stages, including avoidance, aggression, and curiosity before habituation. We compare results between groups and across sites and discuss how factors such as tracking abilities, group size and cohesion, population density and home range overlap, and the manner of approaching gorillas during contacts influence the habituation process."
"Interspecific and temporal variation of ant species within Acacia drepanolobium ant domatia, a staple food of patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas) in Laikipia, Kenya","['Isbell, LA', 'Young, TP']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20444,DEC 2007,14,"The ants that live in the swollen thorns (domatia) of Acacia drepanolobium are staple foods for patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas). To obtain a better understanding of these insects as resources for patas monkeys, we sampled the contents of 1,051 swollen thorns (ant domatia) over a 22-month period from December 1999 to September 2001, in Laikipia, Kenya. First, we confirmed that of the four species of ants that live on A. drepanolobium, Crematogaster sjostedti, the competitively dominant ant in this system, does not rear significant brood in the swollen thorns and is therefore not a major food item of patas monkeys. Second, across the other three species that do use swollen thorns for rearing their brood, C. nigriceps, C. mimosae, and Tetraponera penzigi, the number of worker ants per swollen thorn increased with increasing competitive dominance. Third, although there was considerable month-to-month variation in the number of workers, immatures, and especially alates (winged reproductives) within species, there was less variation across species because ant production was asynchronous. Variation in domatia contents was poorly related to rainfall for each of the three species. Finally, distal thorns held more alates and fewer workers than interior thorns, and branches higher off the ground held more alates and more workers than lower branches. For the numerically dominant C. mimosae, higher branches held significantly more immature ants than did lower branches. Ants are reliable food resources for patas monkeys, and are probably more reliable than many plant resources in this highly seasonal environment. We estimate that patas monkeys may get as much as a third of their daily caloric needs from these ants year-round. As ants and other insects are widely consumed by primates, we suggest that greater consideration be given to species differences in animal food choices and that further studies be conducted to examine the degree to which ants influence energy intake and reproduction in other primates."
"Intergroup encounters in mountain gorillas of bwindi impenetrable National Park, Uganda","['Robbins, MM', 'Sawyer, SC']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/156853907782512146,DEC 2007,10,"The aim of this study was to examine the influence of frugivory and social factors on behaviour during intergroup encounters in the mountain gorillas of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. Frugivory was associated with an increase in the frequency of intergroup encounters, but had no impact on the length of the encounter, or on the type of behaviour exhibited, suggesting that while neighbouring groups may be attracted to limited fruit patches, there was no indication of between group feeding competition. Encounters with solitary males were more likely to elicit more avoidance, less tolerance, more herding behaviour, and a trend towards more aggression than encounters with groups. The number of potential migrant females and the number of silverbacks had no impact on the type of behaviour exhibited. However, an older dominant male was less likely to be aggressive towards the opposing group when a subordinate male was present, suggesting a collective action problem rather than cooperation in multi-male groups. Combined these results suggest that between group competition is linked more to mate defence and acquisition than resource defence. This study contributes to our understanding of the relationship among intergroup encounters, feeding ecology, reproductive strategies and social structure in gorillas."
Manipulating decay time for efficient large-mammal density estimation: gorillas and dung height,"['Kuehl, HS', 'Todd, A', 'Boesch, C', 'Walsh, PD']",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,10.1890/06-0934.1,DEC 2007,12,"Large-mammal surveys often rely on indirect signs such as dung or nests. Sign density is usually translated into animal density using sign production and decay rates. In principle, such auxiliary variable estimates should be made in a spatially unbiased manner. However, traditional decay rate estimation methods entail following many signs from production to disappearance, which, in large study areas, requires extensive travel effort. Consequently, decay rate estimates have tended to be made instead at some convenient but unrepresentative location. In this study we evaluated how much bias might be induced by extrapolating decay rates from unrepresentative locations, how much effort would be required to implement current methods in a spatially unbiased manner, and what alternate approaches might be used to improve precision. To evaluate the extent of bias induced by unrepresentative sampling, we collected data on gorilla dung at several central African sites. Variation in gorilla dung decay rate was enormous, varying by up to an order of magnitude within and between survey zones. We then estimated what the effort-precision relationship would be for a previously suggested ""retrospective'' decay rate (RDR) method, if it were implemented in a spatially unbiased manner. We also evaluated precision for a marked sign count (MSC) approach that does not use a decay rate. Because they require repeat visits to remote locations, both RDR and MSC require enormous effort levels in order to gain precise density estimates. Finally, we examined an objective criterion for decay (i.e.,dung height). This showed great potential for improving RDR efficiency because choosing a high threshold height for decay reduces decay time and, consequently, the number of visits that need to be made to remote areas. The ability to adjust decay time using an objective decay criterion also opens up the potential for a ""prospective'' decay rate (PDR) approach. Further research is necessary to evaluate whether the temporal bias inherent in such an approach is small enough to ignore, given the 10 -20-fold increases in precision promised by a PDR approach."
Evolutionary consequences of fallback foods,"['Marshall, AJ', 'Wrangham, RW']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-007-9218-5,DEC 2007,21,"Primatologists use the term fallback foods to denote resources of relatively low preference that are used seasonally when preferred foods are unavailable. We examine the assumption that fallback foods play an important role in shaping morphological adaptations, behavior, and socioecology in primates. We discuss operational definitions of preferred and fallback foods and suggest that the evolutionary importance of fallback foods applies more to adaptations for processing than for harvesting foods. Equally, we propose that preferred resources tend to drive adaptations for harvesting foods. We distinguish 2 classes of fallback foods according to their roles in the diet and their evolutionary effects. Staple fallback foods are available year-round, tend to be eaten throughout the year, and seasonally can constitute up to 100% of the diet. Filler fallback foods never constitute 100% of the diet, and may be completely avoided for weeks at a time. We suggest that the availability of the 2 classes of fallback foods have different effects on the socioecology of primate species."
Handedness and grooming in Pan troglodytes: Comparative analysis between findings in captive and wild individuals,"['Hopkins, WD', 'Russell, JL', 'Remkus, M', 'Freeman, H', 'Schapiro, SJ']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-007-9221-x,DEC 2007,19,"Grooming is a complex set of motor actions, common in highly social primates. We tested for asymmetries in hand use during unimanual and bimanual allogrooming in 215 captive chimpanzees. In addition to hand use, we coded in the ethogram whether the manual grooming action co-occurred with the use of the mouth. Overall, grooming did not elicit strong handedness at the individual level, but there is a small yet significant population-level right-hand bias for bimanual grooming. Mouth use during grooming had no influence on hand use. A comparison of the findings with previously published data on handedness for grooming in wild chimpanzees suggests that wild apes are more right-handed than captive individuals are for allogrooming. Collectively, the results suggest that role differentiation of the hands is an important factor in the assessment of handedness for grooming, and perhaps additional manual actions of chimpanzees and other primates."
Effects of ecology on the gastrointestinal parasites of Alouatta pigra,"['Vitazkova, SK', 'Wade, SE']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-007-9229-2,DEC 2007,20,"We examined the effects of demographic and ecological variables on the prevalence of intestinal parasites in free-ranging black howlers, Alouatta pigra, from Belize and Mexico. We collected 253 fecal samples from 50 individually identified monkeys during 2003. We processed all samples via standard centrifugation concentration techniques with sugar and zinc sulfate as flotation media. We used antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to detect protozoa. We analyzed data for each season separately. The most important factor in predicting whether an Alouatta pigra would be infected with a parasite was its membership in a particular social troop. It was not possible to isolate the effects of human presence, forest fragmentation, primate density, and the absence of Ateles geoffroyi on the prevalence of parasites in Alouatta pigra because the factors covaried. We detected few species of gastrointestinal parasites, possibly due to Alouatta pigra's arboreal and herbivorous lifestyle and small geographic range. The prevalence of each parasite had a different pattern, with Controrchis sp. (presumed to be C. biliophilus), a fluke, tending to be more prevalent in Alouatta pigra that inhabited disturbed habitats, and Trypanoxyuris minutus, a pinworm, tending to be more prevalent in primates from undisturbed habitats. Giardia sp. tended to be more prevalent in primates at high densities. These results indicated that it is important to examine each parasite's infection pattern separately to obtain a more accurate representation of the dynamics among the host, parasites, and ecology."
"Parasite prevalence, abundance, and diversity in a semi-free-ranging colony of Mandrillus sphinx","['Setchell, JM', 'Bedjabaga, IB', 'Goossens, B', 'Reed, P', 'Wickings, EJ', 'Knapp, LA']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-007-9225-6,DEC 2007,12,"We examined parasite prevalence, abundance of protozoan cysts and helminth eggs in the feces, and number of parasitic taxa in a population of mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) in semi-free-ranging conditions in their habitat range, with respect to the annual cycle, sex, age, dominance rank, and female reproductive status. We identified 3 taxa of amebic protozoa (Entamoeba coli, E. histolytica/dispar complex, and Endolimax nana), 1 ciliate protozoa (Balantidium coli), and various nematodes. Prevalence ranged from 1 observation in 874 samples for Trichuris and Mammomonogamus (nematodes) to 100% for Entamoeba coli and Endolimax nana. Daily observation, consistency of fecal samples, and periodic veterinary examination indicated that the mandrills were all healthy, suggesting that the presence of intestinal parasites in the provisioned population is well tolerated. Parasite prevalence, abundance in the feces, and number of taxa varied significantly across the annual cycle. Nematode egg prevalence and abundance were lowest during the dry season. We found no sexual difference and no influence of female dominance rank on parasitic infections. Nematode prevalence increased significantly with age in females, but not in males. There was no influence of age on prevalence of other taxa, abundance in the feces, or number of taxa. Abundance of nematode eggs in the feces was higher in pregnant than in lactating or cycling females. However, births are seasonal in the mandrill colony, and pregnant females were present during the months when nematode egg abundance was also higher in males, suggesting that this may be an influence of climatic seasonality in addition to, or instead of, female status."
"Sleeping parties and nest distribution of chimpanzees in the savanna woodland, ugalla, tanzania","['Ogawa, H', 'Idani, G', 'Moore, J', 'Pintea, L', 'Hernandez-Aguilar, A']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-007-9210-0,DEC 2007,27,"We conducted ecological studies of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in the Ugalla area, western Tanzania. Ugalla is one of the driest habitats of chimpanzees and the Ugalla River is the eastern boundary of chimpanzee distribution. Most of Ugalla is occupied by savanna woodlands dominated by deciduous trees of Brachystegia and Julbernardia. Chimpanzees tended not to make nests in riverine forests in plains, but in small patchy forests dominated by Monopetalanthus richardsiae and valley forests dominated by Julbernardia unijugata on slopes in mountainous areas. We estimated population density of chimpanzees to be 7-9x10(-2) individuals/km(2) based on nest censuses, suggesting that 2-3x10(2) individuals inhabited the 3352 km(2) area of Ugalla. The size of the largest nest cluster (n=23) suggests that 1 unit group (community) comprised 30-35 individuals. In the daytime, chimpanzees formed small feeding parties (mean 2.0 individuals), but larger ones in the evening (mean 4.8 individuals and 5.2 individuals based on fresh nest clusters). The pattern might reduce the predation risk from large nocturnal carnivores such as lions and leopards. The sleeping sites may function as both a safe sleeping site and a meeting point for chimpanzees with a huge home range that may have difficulty in finding other members of their unit group."
Relative strength of the tibia and fibula and locomotor behavior in hominoids,"['Marchi, D', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.05.007,DEC 2007,15,"The fibula has rarely been considered in comparative morphological studies, probably due to its relatively minor role in carrying mechanical loads. However, some differences in morphology (and inferred function) of the fibula between humans and apes, and within apes, have been noted and related to differences in positional behavior. Therefore, the study of tibiofibular relations may be useful in characterizing such differences. This study examines cross-sectional geometric (CSG) properties (cortical area and polar section modulus, Z(p)) of the tibia and fibula at mid-diaphysis across a sample (n = 87) of humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons. The fibula is compared against the tibia in the different taxa. The results indicate that the robusticity of the fibula relative to that. of the tibia can be explained in terms of differences in positional behavior. In particular, hominoids that are more arboreal (i.e., gibbons, orangutans, and chimpanzees) possess a relatively more robust fibula than do hominoids that are more terrestrial (i.e., gorillas and humans). The difference appears to be a consequence of the more mobile fibula and more adducted position of the hindlimb necessary in an arboreal environment. Apart from providing the first CSG data on the fibula, these results may be helpful in reconstructing the locomotor behavior of fossil hominoids. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Age-related differences in the performance, diffusion, and maintenance of stone handling, a behavioral tradition in Japanese macaques","['Leca, JB', 'Gunst, N', 'Huffman, MA']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.05.009,DEC 2007,19,"Identifying the sources of behavioral diversity in non-human primates is vital to understanding the evolution of human behavior. Stone handling (SH, hereafter) is a form of object play consisting of the manipulation of stones by performing various behavioral patterns. This behavior is socially transmitted from generation to generation in Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), as a behavioral tradition. SH behavior in particular may reflect on the origin and evolution of stone-too] material culture. The objective of this study was to assess how group size, age structure, and age- and sex-related differences may account for the substantial intra- and inter-troop variations in SH reported in ten troops of Japanese macaques. Our results supported the hypothesis that patterns of variation in SH across troops reflected variability in group size and composition in age classes. We found that troop size was correlated with the proportion of troop members exhibiting SH simultaneously. The effect of troop size on the synchronized performance of SH may reveal the contagious nature of play. Our results suggest that the age structure of the group may affect the diffusion of SH. As predicted by the surplus energy hypothesis, a major functional hypothesis about play, intra-group variation in SH reflected more age- than sex-related differences. SH mainly occurred and was more frequent in younger than in older individuals, whereas no significant sex differences were found. SH episodes were shorter, more vigorous, and SH patterns were more diverse and less complex in immature than in mature individuals. The present findings reveal that age-related factors and group size may constrain the performance, diffusion, and maintenance of SH within a troop. Contrary to most other socially transmitted stone-tool using behaviors in non-human primates and early hominids, there is no optimal SH pattern. Provided some form of social learning, the non-adaptive nature of SH may allow particular SH pattern preferences to emerge at the group level. Our findings urge the use of an inter-populational comparative approach based on multivariate analyses when addressing the question of the evolution of behavioral traditions in primate and human populations.

Extended male growth in a fossil hominin species,"['Lockwood, CA', 'Menter, CG', 'Moggi-Cecchi, J', 'Keyser, AW']",SCIENCE,10.1126/science.1149211,NOV 30 2007,39,"In primates that are highly sexually dimorphic, males often reach maturity later than females, and young adult males do not show the size, morphology, and coloration of mature males. Here we describe extended male development in a hominin species, Paranthropus robustus. Ranking a large sample of facial remains on the basis of dental wear stages reveals a difference in size and robusticity between young adult and old adult males. Combined with estimates of sexual dimorphism, this pattern suggests that male reproductive strategy focused on monopolizing groups of females, in a manner similar to that of silverback gorillas."

Genetic diversity and phylogeographic clustering of SIVcpzPtt in wild chimpanzees in Cameroon,"['Van Heuverswyn, F', 'Li, Y', 'Bailes, E', 'Neel, C', 'Lafay, B', 'Keele, BF', 'Shaw, KS', 'Takehisa, J', 'Kraus, MH', 'Loul, S', 'Butel, C', 'Liegeois, F', 'Yangda, B', 'Sharp, PM', 'Mpoudi-Ngole, E', 'Delaporte, E', 'Hahn, BH', 'Peeters, M']",VIROLOGY,10.1016/j.virol.2007.06.018,NOV 10 2007,64,"It is now well established that the clade of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting west central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) comprises the progenitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In this study, we have greatly expanded our previous molecular epidemiological survey of SIVcpz in wild chimpanzees in Cameroon. The new results confirm a wide but uneven distribution of SIVcpzPtt in P. t. troglodytes throughout southern Cameroon and indicate the absence of SIVcpz infection in Pan troglodytes vellerosus. Analyzing 725 fecal samples from 15 field sites, we obtained partial nucleotide sequences from 16 new SlVcpzPtt strains and determined full-length sequences for two of these. Phylogenetic analyses of these new viruses confirmed the previously reported phylogeographic clustering of SIVcpzPtt lineages, with viruses related to the ancestors of HIV-1 groups M and N circulating exclusively in southeastern and south central P. t. troglodytes communities, respectively. Importantly, the SIVcpzPtt strains from the southeastern corner of Cameroon represent a relatively isolated clade indicating a defined geographic origin of the chimpanzee precursor of HIV-1 group M. Since contacts between humans and apes continue, the possibility of ongoing transmissions of SIV from chimpanzees (or gorillas) to humans has to be considered. In this context, our finding of distinct SIVcpzPtt envelope V3 sequence clades suggests that these peptides may be useful for the serological differentiation of SIVcpzPtt and HIV-1 infections, and thus the diagnosis of new cross-species transmissions if they occurred.

Using photogrammetry and color scoring to assess sexual dimorphism in wild Western Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla),"['Breuer, T', 'Robbins, MM', 'Boesch, C']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20678,NOV 2007,25,"Investigating sexual dimorphism is important for our understanding of its influence on reproductive strategies including male-male competition, mate choice, and sexual conflict. Measuring physical traits in wild animals can be logistically challenging and disruptive for the animals. Therefore body size and ornament variation in wild primates have rarely been quantified. Gorillas are amongst the most sexually dimorphic and dichromatic primates. Adult males (silverbacks) possess a prominent sagittal crest, a pad of fibrous and fatty tissue on top of the head, have red crest coloration, their saddle appears silver, and they possess a silverline along their stomach. Here we measure levels of sexual dimorphism and within male variation of body length, head size, and sexual dichromatism in a population of wild western gorillas using photogrammetry. Digital photogrammetry is a useful and precise method to measure sexual dimorphism in physical traits yielding sexual dimorphism indices (ISD), similar to those derived from traditional measurements of skeletal remains. Silverbacks were on an average 1.23 times longer in body length than adult females. Sexual dimorphism of head size was highest in measures of crest size (max ISD: 60.4) compared with measures of facial height (max ISD: 24.7). The most sexually dimorphic head size measures also showed the highest within-sex variation. We found no clear sex differences in crest coloration but there was large sexual dichromatism with high within male variation in saddle coloration and silverline size. Further studies should examine if these sexually dimorphic traits are honest signals of competitive ability and confer an advantage in reproductive success."
A comparative volumetric analysis of the amygdaloid complex and basolateral division in the human and ape brain,"['Barger, N', 'Stefanacci, L', 'Semendeferi, K']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20684,NOV 2007,26,"The amygdaloid complex functions to facilitate effective appraisal of the social environment and is an essential component of the neural systems subserving social behavior. Despite its critical role in mediating social interaction, the amygdaloid complex has not attracted the same attention as the isocortex in most evolutionary analyses. We performed a comparative analysis of the amygdaloid complex in the hominoids to address the lack of comparative information available for this structure in the hominoid brain. We demarcated the amygdaloid complex and the three nuclei constituting its basolateral division, the lateral, basal, and accessory basal nuclei, in 12 histological series representing all six hominoid species. The volumes obtained for these areas were subjected to allometric analyses to determine whether any species deviated from expected values based on the other hominoids. Differences between groups were addressed using nonparametric comparisons of means. The human lateral nucleus was larger than predicted for an ape of human brain size and occupied the majority of the basolateral division, whereas the basal nucleus was the largest of the basolateral nuclei in all ape species. In orangutans the amygdala and basolateral division were smaller than in the African apes. while the gorilla had a smaller than predicted lateral nucleus, its basal and accessory basal nuclei were larger than predicted. These differences may reflect volumetric changes occurring in interconnected cortical areas, specifically the temporal lobe and orbitofrontal cortex, which also subserve social behavior and cognition, suggesting that this system may be acted upon in hominoid and hominid evolution."
Tool use during display behavior in wild Cross River gorillas,"['Wittiger, L', 'Sunderland-Groves, JL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20436,NOV 2007,10,"During the course of a 3-year ecological study on Cross River gorillas (Gorilla gorilla diehli) at the Kagwene Mountain in Cameroon, we observed three cases of tool use which may be unique to the gorillas of this region and possibly learned through interactions with humans. A non-habituated group of Cross River gorillas threw fistfuls of grass toward humans in display contexts. An individual gorilla was also observed to throw a detached branch toward researchers during another encounter. The third encounter occurred between the focal group and a local man, in which the man threw stones at the gorillas and they reacted by throwing fistfuls of grass back at him. We describe these observations and speculate that this sub-population of gorillas developed this display behavior as a response to particular local conditions."

Hominoid lineage specific amplification of low-copy repeats on 22q11.2 (LCR22s) associated with velo-cardio-facial/digeorge syndrome,"['Babcock, M', 'Yatsenko, S', 'Hopkins, J', 'Brenton, M', 'Cao, Q', 'de Jong, P', 'Stankiewicz, P', 'Lupski, JR', 'Sikela, JM', 'Morrow, BE']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/ddm197,NOV 2007,17,"Segmental duplications or low-copy repeats (LCRs) constitute similar to 5% of the sequenced portion of the human genome and are associated with many human congenital anomaly disorders. The low-copy repeats on chromosome 22q11.2 ( LCR22s) mediate chromosomal rearrangements resulting in deletions, duplications and translocations. The evolutionary mechanisms leading to LCR22 formation is unknown. Four genes, USP18, BCR, GGTLA and GGT, map adjacent to the LCR22s and pseudogene copies are located within them. It has been hypothesized that gene duplication occurred during primate evolution, followed by recombination events, forming pseudogene copies. We investigated whether gene duplication could be detected in non-human hominoid species. FISH mapping was performed using probes to the four functional gene loci. There was evidence for a single copy in humans but additional copies in hominoid species. We then compared LCR22 copy number using LCR22 FISH probes. Lineage specific LCR22 variation was detected in the hominoid species supporting the hypothesis. To independently validate initial findings, real time PCR, and screening of gorilla BAC library filters were performed. This was compared to array comparative genome hybridization data available. The most striking finding was a dramatic amplification of LCR22s in the gorilla. The LCR22s localized to the telomeric or subtelomeric bands of gorilla chromosomes. The most parsimonious explanation is that the LCR22s became amplified by inter-chromosomal recombination between telomeric bands. In summary, our results are consistent with a lineage specific coupling between gene and LCR22 duplication events. The LCR22s thus serve as an important model for evolution of genome variation."
Phylogenetic diversity and the conservation biogeography of African primates,"['McGoogan, K', 'Kivell, T', 'Hutchison, M', 'Young, H', 'Blanchard, S', 'Keeth, M', 'Lehman, SM']",JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01759.x,NOV 2007,11,"Aim Phylogenetics has an important role in conservation biogeography. However, there are few data on the phylogenetic diversity of African primates. The phylogenetic diversity (PD) of a species is a measure of its taxonomic distinctness and can be estimated by looking at the phylogenetic relationships among taxa. Species-specific metrics on PD can then be used to determine conservation priorities at various biogeographical scales. We used PD metrics to rank 55 African primate species according to their conservation priorities at the country level and within six African biogeographical regions. We also addressed the following question: are there differences in conservation rankings between the IUCN Red List and our PD metrics?

Location Africa.

Methods We created a consensus phylogeny for all African primate clades based on genetic studies. Analyses of species distributions were determined using presence/absence scores at two levels: country and biogeographical region. A node-based method that standardizes for widespread taxa and endemicity was used to calculate PD indices. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to convert one of the standardized, phylogenetic indices into three clusters that could be ranked and compared with the main IUCN conservation rankings of endangered, vulnerable, and lower risk.

Results At the country and region levels, the top-priority species in terms of PD are Pan paniscus, Macaca sylvanus, Arctocebus calabarensis, Gorilla beringei, Arctocebus aureus, Allenopithecus nigroviridis, Gorilla gorilla, Procolobus verus, Cercopithecus solatus, Cercocebus galeritus, Colobus angolensis, Theropithecus gelada, Galagoides zanzibaricus, Galagoides granti, and Procolobus (Piliocolobus) badius. Geographic rankings were highest for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (country level) and Central Africa (region level). Although there were no overall differences between IUCN conservation ranks and the PD rankings, there were significant differences between the two systems for vulnerable and endangered primate taxa.

Main conclusions There are few ecological and behavioural data on populations of some of the African primates that represent the highest levels of phylogenetic diversity. Studies of primate taxa with high PD rankings should focus on identifying sites suitable for intensive studies of population densities, feeding ecology, and reproductive behaviour. We suggest that PD metrics can serve as an important, complementary data set in the IUCN ranking system for primates."
Mast cell alpha and beta tryptases speciation and evolved from changed rapidly during primate gamma-like transmembrane peptidases in ancestral vertebrates,"['Trivedi, NN', 'Tong, Q', 'Raman, K', 'Bhagwandin, VJ', 'Caughey, GH']",JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY,NA,NOV 1 2007,18,"Human mast cell tryptases vary strikingly in secretion, catalytic competence, and inheritance. To explore the basis of variation, we compared genes from a range of primates, including humans, great apes (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan), Old- and New-World monkeys (macaque and marmoset), and a prosimian (galago), tracking key changes. Our analysis reveals that extant soluble tryptase-like proteins, including alpha- and beta-like tryptases, mastins, and implantation serine proteases, likely evolved from membrane-anchored ancestors because their more deeply rooted relatives (gamma tryptases, pancreasins, prostasins) are type I transmembrane peptidases. Function-altering mutations appeared at widely separated times during primate speciation, with tryptases evolving by duplication, gene conversion, and point mutation. The a-tryptase Gly(216)Asp catalytic domain mutation, which diminishes activity, is present in macaque tryptases, and thus arose before great apes and Old World monkeys shared an ancestor, and before the alpha beta split. However, the Arg(-3)Gln processing mutation appeared recently, affecting only human a. By comparison, the transmembrane gamma-tryptase gene, which anchors the telomeric end of the multigene tryptase locus, changed little during primate evolution. Related transmembrane peptidase genes were found in reptiles, amphibians, and fish. We identified soluble tryptase-like genes in the full spectrum of mammals, including marsupial (opossum) and monotreme (platypus), but not in nonmammalian vertebrates. Overall, our analysis suggests that soluble tryptases evolved rapidly from membrane-anchored, two-chain peptidases in ancestral vertebrates into soluble, single-chain, self-compartmentalizing, inhibitor-resistant oligomers expressed primarily by mast cells, and that much of present numerical, behavioral, and genetic diversity of a- and beta-like tryptases was acquired during primate evolution."
Nutritional composition of the diet of the gorilla (Gorilla beringei): a comparison between two montane habitats,"['Rothman, JM', 'Plumptre, AJ', 'Dierenfeld, ES', 'Pell, AN']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,10.1017/S0266467407004555,NOV 2007,36,"The mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) lives in two geographically separated populations, Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda and in three national parks spanning the Virunga mountain region in Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda. The altitude, climate and plant composition of these habitats differ. Our goal was to compare the diets of gorillas living in each of these habitats. The nutrients in staple foods and in the diets of individuals in a group of gorillas in Bwindi (N = 12 individuals) and a group in the Virungas (N = 7 individuals) were compared to determine if differences in dietary composition affected concentrations of nutrients in their diets. At both sites gorilla diets consisted primarily of herbaceous leaves, but the diet of Bwindi gorillas contained more tree leaves, fruit, pith and dry wood, and fewer stems. Despite differences in habitat and dietary composition, the nutrient concentrations in both gorilla diets were remarkably similar. On a dry matter basis, the diets and staple foods of Bwindi and Virunga gorillas contained similar concentrations of crude protein (CP), fibre (NDF) and non-structural carbohydrates (TNC). Bwindi gorillas ate diets containing 18%, CP, 430% NDF and 19% TNC on a dry-matter basis, while the diets of the Virunga gorillas contained 17% CP, 41% NDF and 181% TNC. Our results demonstrate that gorillas consume diets that differ by plant species and part, but contain similar concentrations of nutrients. This suggests that classifying animals by broad dietary strategy (e.g. frugivory and folivory) does not provide a reliable indicator of the nutritional quality of their diet, and that our previous assumptions about these categories should be re-evaluated."

"The evolutionary origins of obstructed labor: Bipedalism, encephalization, and the human obstetric dilemma","['Wittman, AB', 'Wall, LL']",OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY,NA,NOV 2007,35,"Obstructed labor is a common complication of human childbirth. In parts of the world where access to emergency obstetric services is limited, obstructed labor is a major cause of maternal mortality. Women who survive the ordeal of prolonged obstructed labor often end up suffering from an obstetric vesicovaginal fistula or another serious birth injury that leaves them crippled for life. Compared with the other higher primates (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans), these problems are uniquely human. This article reviews the evolutionary origins of the human obstetric dilemma with special reference to the changes imposed on pelvic architecture by the assumption of upright, bipedal posture and locomotion. The subsequent development of progressively increasing brain size (encephalization) in hominins led to the present human obstetrical conundrum: how to balance the evolutionary advantage of bigger babies with larger brains against the presence of a narrow pelvis that is difficult for a fetus to traverse during labor."
"Comparative ocular anatomy of the western lowland gorilla
","['Knapp, S', 'McCulley, JP', 'Alvarado, TP', 'Hogan, RN']",VETERINARY OPHTHALMOLOGY,10.1111/j.1463-5224.2007.00568.x,NOV-DEC 2007,4,"Objective To examine the lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) eye and determine similarities to and differences between the mountain gorilla (Gorilla gorilla, beringei) and the human eye. In addition, we compare our findings of G. g. gorilla to previous reports on the eye of this subspecies.

Procedures A 13-year-old deceased male lowland gorilla and a 34-year-old deceased female lowland gorilla were included in the study. Gross and microscopic examinations of the formalin-fixed right eyeball of each gorilla were carried out.

Results Globe dimensions of G. g. gorilla were similar to G. g. beringei and to humans. The limbal conjunctival epithelium and the choroid were densely pigmented. However, the distribution of the conjunctival pigment ring was different to that of G. g. beringei and the melanocytes of the choroid were unusually round. There were deep crypts in the anterior border layer of the iris, and the epithelium of the pars plana was uniquely irregular. Vertical corneal diameter was observed to be equal or greater than horizontal diameter in G. g. gorilla, which is in contrast to humans and to previous findings for G. g. beringei. Corneal thickness was closer to that of humans than to G. g. beringei. Posterior lens capsule thickness was noticeably greater than that of humans.

Conclusions Although some variation between the ocular anatomy of G. g. gorilla and G. g. beringei does exist, the gross and microscopic findings closely resemble each other in these two subspecies. In addition, the eye of Gorilla appears remarkably similar to the human eye. However, comparison of measurements with those in humans is somewhat limited because formalin-fixation can introduce tissue shrinkage and artifact."

Functional evidence for differences in sperm competition in humans and chimpanzees,"['Anderson, MJ', 'Chapman, SJ', 'Videan, EN', 'Evans, E', 'Fritz, J', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Dixson, AF', 'Gagneux, P']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20674,OCT 2007,20,"more males compete for opportunities to fertilize a given set of ova. Previous studies have demonstrated that certain morphological characteristics are affected by sperm competition intensity (e.g. relative testes size and sperm midpiece volume). This study examined whether aspects of sperm energetics may also be affected by sexual selection. We compared the membrane potential of mitochondria in live sperm between H. sapiens (single partner mating system) and R troglodytes (multiple partner mating system). Flow cytometry of sperm stained with the carbocyanine fluorescent dye JC-1 (an assay for mitochondrial membrane potential) revealed marked differences in red fluorescence intensity. R troglodytes sperm showed significantly higher mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitochondria provide a substantial part of the energy required for sperm motility. A higher mitochondrial loading may therefore be associated with enhanced sperm motility and/or longevity. Additionally, examination of JC-1 red fluorescence levels before and after in vitro capacitation revealed further differences. Whereas chimpanzee sperm showed maintenance of membrane potential after capacitation (in some cases even an increase), sperm from humans consistently showed reduction in membrane potential. These results indicate that the sperm of human beings and chimpanzees exhibit marked differences in mitochondrial function, which are affected by selection pressures relating to sperm competition and that these pressures differ significantly between humans and chimpanzees."
Dog-logic: inferential reasoning in a two-way choice task and its restricted use,"['Erdohegyi, A', 'Topal, J', 'Viranyi, Z', 'Miklosi, A']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.03.004,OCT 2007,59,"Three experiments were designed to test whether adult pet dogs are able to show inferential reasoning when searching for their toy in a series of two-way choice tasks. The experimenter placed a toy under one of two identical containers and then provided some information by manipulating the covers: either both containers were lifted or just the empty or baited one. There were other trials when the experimenter not only revealed the corresponding container but manipulated also the other one without showing its content. In the second experiment the same conditions were used except that the content of the containers was revealed by strings without any human manipulation. Results of the two studies show that dogs are able to use inferential reasoning by exclusion (i.e. they can find the hidden toy if they have seen where the toy was missing). However, dogs were able to solve the reasoning task only when they could not rely on social-communicative cues ( directional gesture and gaze cues) or could not use any other simple discriminative stimuli ( movement of a container) for making decisions. This suggests that dogs are often prevented from showing reasoning abilities by pre-existing biases for social or movement cues. Results of the third experiment also support the primary importance of social cueing because in another object-choice task, individuals preferred to choose the 'socially marked' container ( touching, gaze alternation) to the remotely moved one when they had no visual information about the location of the toy."
Mental representation of symbols as revealed by vocabulary errors in two bonobos (Pan paniscus),"['Lyn, H']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-007-0086-3,OCT 2007,9,"Error analysis has been used in humans to detect implicit representations and categories in language use. The present study utilizes the same technique to report on mental representations and categories in symbol use from two bonobos (Pan paniscus). These bonobos have been shown in published reports to comprehend English at the level of a two-and-a-half year old child and to use a keyboard with over 200 visuographic symbols (lexigrams). In this study, vocabulary test errors from over 10 years of data revealed auditory, visual, and spatio-temporal generalizations (errors were more likely items that looked like sounded like, or were frequently associated with the sample item in space or in time), as well as hierarchical and conceptual categorizations. These error data, like those of humans, are a result of spontaneous responding rather than specific training and do not solely depend upon the sample mode (e.g. auditory similarity errors are not universally more frequent with an English sample, nor were visual similarity errors universally more frequent with a photograph sample). However, unlike humans, these bonobos do not make errors based on syntactical confusions (e.g. confusing semantically unrelated nouns), suggesting that they may not separate syntactical and semantic information. These data suggest that apes spontaneously create a complex, hierarchical, web of representations when exposed to a symbol system."
Apes know that hidden objects can affect the orientation of other objects,"['Call, J']",COGNITION,10.1016/j.cognition.2006.08.004,OCT 2007,19,"Four bonobos, seven gorillas, and six orangutans were presented with two small rectangular boards on a platform. One of the boards had a piece of food under it so that it acquired an inclined orientation whereas the other remained flat on the platform. Subjects preferentially selected the inclined board. In another experiment, subjects were initially presented with two inclined boards and a transformation took place in which one of the boards fell flat to the platform while the other remained inclined. Subjects also preferred the board that remained inclined. Two additional experiments highlighted some of the possible limitations of their reasoning in this task. Presented with two inclined boards, one of which was visibly supported by a piece of wood, they failed to systematically select the unsupported one whose only reason for being inclined was the presence of the reward. Another experiment presented two rewards in each trial (instead of the customary one) in one of the following two combinations: large banana vs. small carrot or small banana vs. large carrot. Prior to the test, E presented both rewards to the subject and then hid each of them under one of the boards so that both boards were differentially inclined due to the different sizes of the rewards involved. Although subjects selected the board that showed a greater inclination (thus securing the larger reward), they disregarded the type of food that was involved. This often meant that they chose the large carrot over the small banana even though they reversed such a choice when the rewards were not occluded by the boards. Providing subjects with a 'reminder' of the type of reward hidden under the boards did not alter the original results. There was no evidence of learning throughout the various experiments and control tests ruled out the possibility of inadvertent cuing by the experimenter, poor performance due to a lack of motivation, or good performance due to a predisposition to select objects with sloped surfaces. It is concluded that subjects made some inferences about the reason for the inclined orientation of the boards, and not simply associated an inclined orientation with the presence of the reward.

A new approach to estimate parameters of speciation models with application to apes,"['Becquet, C', 'Przeworski, M']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.6409707,OCT 2007,153,"How populations diverge and give rise to distinct species remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology, with important implications for a wide range of fields, from conservation genetics to human evolution. A promising approach is to estimate parameters of simple speciation models using polymorphism data from multiple loci. Existing methods, however, make a number of assumptions that severely limit their applicability, notably, no gene flow after the populations split and no intralocus recombination. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate parameters of an isolation- migration model. The approach uses summaries of polymorphism data at multiple loci surveyed in a pair of diverging populations or closely related species and, importantly, allows for intralocus recombination. To illustrate its potential, we applied it to extensive polymorphism data from populations and species of apes, whose demographic histories are largely unknown. The isolation- migration model appears to provide a reasonable fit to the data. It suggests that the two chimpanzee species became reproductively isolated in allopatry similar to 850 Kya, while Western and Central chimpanzee populations split similar to 440 Kya but continued to exchange migrants. Similarly, Eastern and Western gorillas and Sumatran and Bornean orangutans appear to have experienced gene flow since their splits similar to 90 and over 250 Kya, respectively."

It is interesting to note that human leptin shares a very high degree of homology with gorilla, chimpanzee, and orangutan indicative of a common function of leptin in them.

Experiment 1 showed that dogs were able to spontaneously locate a disappearing object in a detour situation. In Experiments 2 and 3, dead reckoning and allocentric spatial information were put in conflict. Results revealed that dogs simultaneously encoded both sources of information when they had to bypass an obstacle to locate a hidden object. Experiment 3 also revealed that, over the course of testing, dogs gradually learned to rely predominantly on allocentric cues when the detour involved several reorientations. The current study reveals that spatial memory of dogs for hidden objects in a detour task was guided by flexibility in processing spatial information. Dogs could simultaneously encode dead reckoning and allocentric information to locate a disappearing object and used them hierarchically according to the complexity of the detour they encountered in the environment."
Inactivation of MOXD2 and S100A15A by Exon deletion during human evolution,"['Hahn, Y', 'Jeong, S', 'Lee, B']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msm146,OCT 2007,15,"We devised a bioinformatics method for systematic identification of putative human-specific exon-deletion mutations that occurred after the divergence of human and chimpanzee and experimentally verified 2 of the predicted mutations in MOXD2 and S100A15A genes. MOXD2 gene encodes a monooxygenase that is highly conserved in mammals and is mostly expressed in the olfactory epithelium in mouse. The presence of a deletion of the last 2 exons and a polymorphic nonsense mutation in exon 6 suggests that MOXD2 gene is inactive in humans. S100A15A is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, the mouse ortholog of which is expressed during epidermal maturation. Human S100A15A gene is likely to be inactive because the start codon-bearing exon is deleted in human. We propose that modification or inactivation of MOXD2 and S100A15A genes have contributed to the loss of certain smell sense in humans and to the development of human skin."

For about 23% of our genome, we share no immediate genetic ancestry with our closest living relative, the chimpanzee. This encompasses genes and exons to the same extent as intergenic regions. We conclude that about 1/3 of our genes started to evolve as human-specific lineages before the differentiation of human, chimps, and gorillas took place. This explains recurrent findings of very old human-specific morphological traits in the fossils record, which predate the recent emergence of the human species about 5-6 MYA. Furthermore, the sorting of such ancestral phenotypic polymorphisms in subsequent speciation events provides a parsimonious explanation why evolutionary derived characteristics are shared among species that are not each other's closest relatives."

The trapezometacarpal articulation is a saddle joint with a trapezial concavity according to its great oblique axis directed at 45 degrees with respect to a sagittal plan for the whole of the simian primates, with a trapezoidal concavity according to a great axis directed in a sagittal plan for the loridae, the galagonidae and the daubentonidae and with a counter fort supported by a mediopalmar apophysis or a sesamoid bone for the lemurpides. The whole of the mediopalmar ligaments is inserted distally on the medial tubercle at the basis of the first metacarpus. This insertion was fibrocartilaginous for the gorilla. The mediopalmar ligaments are very more developed than the laterodorsal ligaments in all the hominidae and the catarhinious. The both groups are equivalent for the platyrhinious and the prosimious. An intracapsular ligament may reinforce the laterodorsal by the lemoridae. The cuneometatarsal articulation presents a sagittal great axis. It was in fact a spiral trochoid joint with a cuneiform convexity in all the simian primates except for the humans. In this late case, the articular surface was less high, more narrow, with less marked relief. The form of this articulation is that of a saddle with a sagittal concavity in the prosimious with a strong lateral and palmar cuneiform tuberosity and a big lateral opposite apophysis at the basis of the first metatarsus. The tendon of the long lateral fibular muscle and one fascicle of the tendon of the anterior tibialis is fixed on the both side of the basis of the first metatarsus, except for human beings in which the tendon was undivided and was principally inserted of the navicular bone. The disposition of the cuneometatarsal ligaments is similar to that of the trapezometacarpal ligaments. The distal insertions of the lateral ligaments are fibrocarlilaginous in the cerpopithecidae. All the metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal are condylar, except for the metacarpophalangeal of the humans which looks like bicondylar; the interphalangeal articulations are bicondylar. The ligamentous devices include the glenoidal and collateral ligaments with their metacarpal- and metatarsophalangeal fascicles and their interphalangeal and phalangeoglenoidal fascicles."

Mean bonobo densities ranged from 0.27 individuals km(-2) in the vicinity of Lake Tumba to 2.2 individuals km(-2) in the Malebo-Nguomi area. In the latter they appear to be living at a higher density than reported for any other site. This may be due to the area's forest-savannah mosaic habitat, which may provide year-round fruit sources, with bonobos falling back on savannah fruits when forest resources are scarce. The bonobos of the Bolombo-Losombo area and the Bosobele-Lubengo chimpanzees have low relative abundances and live in marginal habitats of islands of terra firma within inundated forests."
Alu recombination-mediated structural deletions in the chimpanzee genome,"['Han, K', 'Lee, J', 'Meyer, TJ', 'Wang, J', 'Sen, SK', 'Srikanta, D', 'Liang, P', 'Batzer, MA']",PLOS GENETICS,10.1371/journal.pgen.0030184,OCT 2007,55,"With more than 1.2 million copies, Alu elements are one of the most important sources of structural variation in primate genomes. Here, we compare the chimpanzee and human genomes to determine the extent of Alu recombination-mediated deletion (ARMD) in the chimpanzee genome since the divergence of the chimpanzee and human lineages (similar to 6 million y ago). Combining computational data analysis and experimental verification, we have identified 663 chimpanzee lineage-specific deletions (involving a total of similar to 771 kb of genomic sequence) attributable to this process. The ARMD events essentially counteract the genomic expansion caused by chimpanzee-specific Alu inserts. The RefSeq databases indicate that 13 exons in six genes, annotated as either demonstrably or putatively functional in the human genome, and 299 intronic regions have been deleted through ARMDs in the chimpanzee lineage. Therefore, our data suggest that this process may contribute to the genomic and phenotypic diversity between chimpanzees and humans. In addition, we found four independent ARMD events at orthologous loci in the gorilla or orangutan genomes. This suggests that human orthologs of loci at which ARMD events have already occurred in other nonhuman primate genomes may be ``at-risk'' motifs for future deletions, which may subsequently contribute to human lineage-specific genetic rearrangements and disorders."

Between August 2004 and April 2006, 910 faecal samples were collected from 222 animals housed in 39 groups. The 31 species involved were representatives of prosimians, New World (NW) monkeys, Old World (OW) monkeys and apes. Because individual sampling was impossible, a statistical simulation was performed to estimate a sufficient sample size. All samples were, microscopically examined after an acetic acid-ether concentration. Differences in host species susceptibility were examined by non-parametric tests. Entamoeba spp. (44%) and Giardia spp. (41%) were the most prevalent species. Other parasites detected were Endolimax nana (36%), Chilomastix mesnili (21%), Balantidium coli (13%), Trichuris spp. (10%), Iodamoeba butschlii (5%) and Strongyloides spp. (5%). Parasites for which a significant difference in susceptibility at the level of host taxonomy was noted were Entamoeba spp. (p < 0.001) and C. mesnili (p < 0.05).

"Interspecies hybridization on DNA resequencing microarrays: efficiency of sequence recovery and accuracy of SNP detection in human, ape, and codfish mitochondrial DNA genomes sequenced on a human-specific MitoChip","['Flynn, SMC', 'Carr, SM']",BMC GENOMICS,10.1186/1471-2164-8-339,SEP 25 2007,8,"Background: Iterative DNA ""resequencing"" on oligonucleotide microarrays offers a high-throughput method to measure intraspecific biodiversity, one that is especially suited to SNP-dense gene regions such as vertebrate mitochondrial (mtDNA) genomes. However, costs of single-species design and microarray fabrication are prohibitive. A cost-effective, multi-species strategy is to hybridize experimental DNAs from diverse species to a common microarray that is tiled with oligonucleotide sets from multiple, homologous reference genomes. Such a strategy requires that cross-hybridization between the experimental DNAs and reference oligos from the different species not interfere with the accurate recovery of species-specific data. To determine the pattern and limits of such interspecific hybridization, we compared the efficiency of sequence recovery and accuracy of SNP identification by a 15,452-base human-specific microarray challenged with human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and codfish mtDNA genomes.

Results: In the human genome, 99.67% of the sequence was recovered with 100.0% accuracy. Accuracy of SNP identification declines log-linearly with sequence divergence from the reference, from 0.067 to 0.247 errors per SNP in the chimpanzee and gorilla genomes, respectively. Efficiency of sequence recovery declines with the increase of the number of interspecific SNPs in the 25b interval tiled by the reference oligonucleotides. In the gorilla genome, which differs from the human reference by 10%, and in which 46% of these 25b regions contain 3 or more SNP differences from the reference, only 88% of the sequence is recoverable. In the codfish genome, which differs from the reference by >30%, less than 4% of the sequence is recoverable, in short islands >= 12b that are conserved between primates and fish.

Conclusion: Experimental DNAs bind inefficiently to homologous reference oligonucleotide sets on a resequencing microarray when their sequences differ by more than a few percent. The data suggest that interspecific cross-hybridization will not interfere with the accurate recovery of species-specific data from multispecies microarrays, provided that the species' DNA sequences differ by > 20% (mean of 5b differences per 25b oligo). Recovery of DNA sequence data from multiple, distantly-related species on a single multiplex gene chip should be a practical, highly-parallel method for investigating genomic biodiversity."
"Scaling of neuron number and volume of the pulvinar complex in new world primates: Comparisons with humans, other primates, and mammals","['Chalfin, BP', 'Cheung, DT', 'Muniz, JAPC', 'Silveira, LCD', 'Finlay, BL']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY,10.1002/cne.21406,SEP 2 2007,18,"The lateral posterior nucleus and pulvinar (LP-pulvinar complex) are the principal thalamic nuclei associated with the elaborate development of the dorsal and ventral streams of the parietal cortex in primates. In humans, a novel site of origin for a subpopulation of pulvinar neurons has been observed, the ganglionic eminence of the telencephalon. This additional site of neuron origin has been proposed to contribute to the pulvinar's evolutionary expansion (Letinic and Rakic [20011 Nat Neurosci 4:930-936). Studies of neuron number in the LP-pulvinar complex in gibbon, chimpanzee, and gorilla compared to humans, however, did not show that the human LP-pulvinar was unexpectedly large (Armstrong [198 11 Am J Phys Anthropol 55:369-383). Here we enlarge the allometric basis for comparison by determining neuron number in the LP-pulvinar complex of six New World primates (Cebus apella, Saimiri ustius, Saguinus midas niger, Alouatta caraya, Aotus azarae, and Callicebus moloch) as well as measuring LP-pulvinar volume in a further set of 24 species including additional primates, carnivores, and rodents. The volume of the LP-pulvinar complex scaled with positive allometry with respect to brain volume across all species examined. The scaling of the number of neurons in the LP-pulvinar complex was extremely similar in New World primates and anthropoid apes, with the human LP-pulvinar value close to the regression line. Comparison of the relative volumes of the LP-pulvinar in the larger sample confirmed this observation, and further demonstrated that both primates and carnivores showed a ""grade shift"" in its size compared to rodents, with the pulvinar comprising a greater proportion of total brain volume across the board. Diurnal, nocturnal, or crepuscular niche did not discriminate LP-pulvinar size across taxa."
Maintenance of imprinting and nuclear architecture in cycling cells,"['Teller, K', 'Solovei, I', 'Buiting, K', 'Horsthemke, B', 'Cremer, T']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0704285104,SEP 18 2007,29,"Dynamic gene repositioning has emerged as an additional level of epigenetic gene regulation. An early example was the report of a transient, spatial convergence (<= 2 mu m) of oppositely imprinted regions (""kissing""), including the Angelman syndrome/Prader-Willi syndrome (AS/PWS) locus and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome locus in human lymphocytes during late S phase. It was argued that kissing is required for maintaining opposite imprints in cycling cells. Employing 3D-FISH with a BAC contig covering the AS/PWS region, light optical, serial sectioning, and quantitative 3D-image analysis, we observed that both loci always retained a compact structure and did not form giant loops. Three-dimensional distances measured among various, homologous AS/PWS segments in 393 human lymphocytes, 132 human fibroblasts, and 129 lymphoblastoid cells from Gorilla gorilla revealed a wide range of distances at any stage of interphase and in Go. At late S phase, 4% of nuclei showed distances <= 2 mu m, 49% showed distances > 6 mu m, and 18% even showed distances > 8 mu m. A similar distance variability was found for Homo sapiens (HSA) 15 centromeres in a PWS patient with a deletion of the maternal AS/PWS locus and for the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome loci in human lymphocytes. A transient kiss during late S phase between loci widely separated at other stages of the cell cycle seems incompatible with known global constraints of chromatin movements in cycling cells. Further experiments suggest that the previously observed convergence of AS/PWS loci during late S phase was most likely a side effect of the convergence of nucleolus organizer region-bearing acrocentric human chromosomes, including HSA 15."

However, other factors, such as constraints on group size or a shortage of potential mates, may promote female dispersal even when female kin associations would be beneficial. In these cases, female kin associations might develop, not through female philopatry, but through female emigration to the same group. To date, little attention has been focused on the potential for kin-biased behaviour between females in female-dispersing species. Here we investigate the genetic relationships among adults in eight wild groups of unhabituated western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) at the Mondika Research Center using microsatellite genotyping of DNA collected from hair and faeces. We found that almost half (40%) of adult females had an adult female relative in the same group and average within-group relatedness among females was significantly higher than that expected under a model of random dispersal. This provides the first genetic evidence that females can maintain social associations with female relatives in spite of routine natal and secondary dispersal. In addition, we show that females appear to avoid related silverback males when making dispersal decisions, suggesting that a strategy of non-random female dispersal may also function to avoid inbreeding."

The biological association of Dioscorea species in eleven research sites of Nteko, Rubuguri, Nyabwishenya, Buhoma, Mpungu, Mushorero, Kagote, Migyera, Kitariro, Ntendure and Rwanju was ascertained. The success of this study was aided by the collaboration with the indigenous community of pygmies (Abayanda). This entailed the interpretation, description, analysis and identification of the data and voucher specimens of the Dioscorea species encountered in the research area. The study focused on the wild yams, a delicacy among the indigenous Abayanda people of Bwindi and Mgahinga forests presently known as Mgahinga Gorilla National Park (MGNP). These two Afromontane forests are known to be rich in plant diversity. The study of Dioscorea species was confined to BINP forest where the numbers of Abayanda are more than those around MGNP and Echuya forest reserves."
Mark tests for mirror self-recognition in Capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) trained to touch marks,"['Roma, PG', 'Silberberg, A', 'Huntsberry, ME', 'Christensen, CJ', 'Ruggier, AM', 'Suomi, SJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20404,SEP 2007,10,"In Experiment 1, three capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) were exposed to a mirror in their home cage for 3 days and then given food treats for touching orange marks located on the surface of an experimental chamber. Following training, a mirror was added to the chamber to see if the monkeys would use it to guide non-reinforced contacts with an orange mark on their foreheads that was only visible as a mirror reflection (mark test). Two monkeys touched the head-mark more often with the mirror present than absent, but no mark touches were emitted while looking at the mirror. In Experiment 2, the monkeys were rewarded for touching orange marks on their bodies that were directly visible, followed by another head-mark test. Again, two monkeys touched the mark more often with the mirror present than absent, but these contacts were not emitted while looking at the mirror. Since facing the mirror while mark touching was not required for reinforcement during training, Experiment 3 further tested the possibility that increased mark touching in the presence of the mirror during Experiments 1 and 2 was the result of a memorial process. For this, a final, novel mark test was conducted using an orange mark on the neck that was only visible as a reflection (Experiment 3). No monkeys passed this test. These are the first mark tests given to capuchin monkeys. The results are consistent with the finding that no monkey species is capable of spontaneous mirror self-recognition. The implications of sequential training and mark testing for comparative evaluations of mirror self-recognition capacity are discussed."

The cluster described is the largest ever recorded in a single center. Cynomolgus monkeys were very susceptible and constituted the monkey species at highest risk, indicating that this species could act as a sentinel animal for the transmission of alveolar echinococcosis in zoological gardens or similar institutions."
The effects of personality of keepers and tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) on their behaviour in an interactive zoo exhibit,"['Phillips, C', 'Peck, D']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2007.01.007,SEP 2007,14,"Personalities can be determined for individual animals from their distinctive patterns of behaviour, providing that they are consistent across time and situations. Although there have been no previous studies of the role of personality in keeper:tiger interactions in zoos/wildlife parks, previous research has determined that cat personality can be reliably assessed from their attributed feelings in social interactions. We asked tiger keepers to rate the personality of their tigers from a list of adjectives, and they consistently used terms relating to three domains representing extroversion, agreeableness and youthfulness. These did not correlate well with simple records of tiger behaviour taken over a short period of time. However, self assessed keeper personalities correlated well with keeper behaviour during interactions with the tigers, which mainly involved intercepting fighting tigers, clapping their hands to elicit a change in behaviour and pushing them to make them move. It is concluded that keeper, but not tiger, personality has strong connections to the interactive behaviour between the two in an interactive zoo exhibit. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Simian foamy virus (SFV) infections have been reported in persons occupationally exposed to nonhuman primates and in a few hunters in Cameroon. To better understand this retroviral zoonosis in natural settings, we studied persons who lived in southern Cameroon, near nonhuman primate habitats. First we studied a general population of 1,164 adults; 4 were SFV positive according to serologic and molecular assays. Then we studied 85 persons who reported having been bitten or scratched by nonhuman primates; 7/29 (24.1 %) of those who had contact with apes (gorillas or chimpanzees) were SFV positive, compared with only 2/56 (3.6%) of those who had had contact with monkeys. These data demonstrate efficient transmission of SFVs to humans in natural settings in central Africa, specifically following ape bites, and viral persistence in the human host."
Spontaneously occurring mother-infant swapping and the relationships of infants with their biological and foster mothers in a captive group of lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Nakarnichi, M', 'Silldorff, A', 'Bingham, C', 'Sexton, P']",INFANT BEHAVIOR & DEVELOPMENT,10.1016/j.infbeh.2006.11.004,SEP 2007,2,"The present study describes spontaneously occurring infant-mother swapping and the relationships of infants with their biological and foster mothers after swapping in a captive social group of lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). After infant-swapping took place between a primparous mother with a neonate and a multiparous mother with a 10-month-old infant, the mothers provided appropriate maternal care, including nursing, to their adopted infants, but the older infant still sought refuge with its biological mother more frequently than with its foster mother. Almost 2 years later, the younger infant who was weaned by its foster mother began nursing from its biological mother; the latter subsequently weaned her adopted infant. Thereafter, the older infant who was weaned exhibited an abnormal hair-plucking behavior. These results indicate that it was psychologically stressful for the gorilla infant to quickly transfer its attachment figure from the mother to another adult female when the mother continued to remain in the Group.

Molecular relationship of hylobates based on Alu elements of the Y chromosome,"['Hong, KW', 'Huh, JW', 'Kim, DS', 'Ha, HS', 'Kim, HS']",KOREAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS,NA,SEP 2007,3,"The phylogenetic relationship among the subgenus Hylobates has been debated by morphological and molecular data. We examined such relationship by comparing nucleotide sequences of a Y chromosomal gene, translation initiation factor 1A Y chromosome (EIF1AY), in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and five species of gibbons (white-handed gibbon, agile gibbon, kloss's gibbon, muller's gibbon, pileated gibbon) using PCR amplification and sequencing. Among hominoid primates, gibbons alone contained Alu elements in their EIF1AY gene of the Y chromosome. In addition, new diagnostic mutation sites named AluYHy as new Alu member were identified in gibbons. Phylogenetic analysis of AluYHy sequences indicated a sister relationship between H. lar and H. klossii. These suggest that the new AluYHy of Y chromosome can be use for understanding gibbon phylogeny and evolution."

A new species of great ape from the late Miocene epoch in Ethiopia,"['Suwa, G', 'Kono, RT', 'Katoh, S', 'Asfaw, B', 'Beyene, Y', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS']",NATURE,10.1038/nature06113,AUG 23 2007,71,"With the discovery of Ardipithecus, Orrorin and Sahelanthropus(1-7), our knowledge of hominid evolution before the emergence of Pliocene species of Australopithecus(8,9) has significantly increased, extending the hominid fossil record back to at least 6 million years (Myr) ago. However, because of the dearth of fossil hominoid remains in sub-Saharan Africa spanning the period 12-7 Myr ago, nothing is known of the actual timing and mode of divergence of the African ape and hominid lineages. Most genomic-based studies suggest a late divergence date-5-6 Myr ago and 6-8 Myr ago for the human-chimp and human-gorilla splits, respectively(10-14)-and some palaeontological and molecular analyses hypothesize a Eurasian origin of the African ape and hominid clade(15,16). We report here the discovery and recognition of a new species of great ape, Chororapithecus abyssinicus, from the 10-10.5-Myr-old deposits of the Chorora Formation at the southern margin of the Afar rift. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first fossils of a large-bodied Miocene ape from the African continent north of Kenya. They exhibit a gorilla-sized dentition that combines distinct shearing crests with thick enamel on its 'functional' side cusps. Visualization of the enamel-dentine junction by micro-computed tomography reveals shearing crest features that partly resemble the modern gorilla condition. These features represent genetically based structural modifications probably associated with an initial adaptation to a comparatively fibrous diet. The relatively flat cuspal enamel-dentine junction and thick enamel, however, suggest a concurrent adaptation to hard and/or abrasive food items. The combined evidence suggests that Chororapithecus may be a basal member of the gorilla clade, and that the latter exhibited some amount of adaptive and phyletic diversity at around 10-11 Myr ago."
A note on the effect of olfactory stimulation on the behaviour and welfare of zoo-housed gorillas,"['Wells, DL', 'Hepper, PG', 'Coleman, D', 'Challis, MG']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2006.07.010,AUG 2007,10,"Olfactory stimulation has been shown to influence the behaviour of a wide variety of species and is now considered a useful form of environmental enrichment for many captive animals. To date, the effect of odour introduction on the behaviour of primates has been subject to little attention. This study thus investigated the behaviour of six zoo-housed western lowland gorillas in response to five odours (no odour [control], orange, vanilla, almond, peppermint) introduced individually on cloths into the animals' exhibit for a period of 5 days per stimulus. The gorillas' behaviour was recorded in each condition using a scan-sampling technique. Analysis showed that the gorillas sniffed the odour-impregnated cloths slightly (although not significantly) more frequently than the control cloths. There was no significant effect of olfactory stimulation on the gorillas' general behaviour (P > 0.05 for all behaviours). Overall, findings suggest that olfactory stimulation in the form of odour-impregnated cloths has little effect on the behaviour of captive gorillas. This raises questions over the value of olfactory stimulation as a useful method of environmental enrichment for this species. Further research using different odours, methods of olfactory presentation, and larger numbers of animals is required, however, before firm conclusions regarding the value of olfactory stimulation for the great apes can be reached.

Opportunities for such studies in primates should increase with the developing population genetic studies used for management and conservation purposes."
Competition coalitions and conflict interventions among captive female gorillas,"['Scott, J', 'Lockard, JS']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-007-9161-5,AUG 2007,2,"Like mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei), western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Howletts Wild Animal Park in Kent, England, intervene in conflicts on behalf of kin. However, in each of the 3 study groups, the female gorillas also appeared to form political alliances: all members of the group almost exclusively supported familiar adult females, i.e., the ones with the greatest group tenure, and their offspring in conflicts involving adult females, the silverback, and immatures. The long-term resident high-status females (HSFs) appeared to form a supportive clique, providing effective competition against low-status females (LSFs). The former maintained dominance status over younger, less familiar adult females that were more recent to the group. Such a pattern is not typical of mountain gorillas in the wild-the subspecies for which data on female relationships are available- except perhaps when groups are unusually large, possibly because mountain gorillas experience little competition over food resources that are widely distributed and relatively freely available. In contrast, the Howletts gorillas had periodic and irregular access to high-energy/-nutrient food resources, for which dominant individuals were able to monopolize the limited available feeding spots. The pattern of agonistic alliances of Howletts females show some similarities with that of some female-philopatric cercopithecines, which also compete over defendable food resources. In female-transfer species, such as gorillas, long-term resident female cliques may be equivalent to matrilines in cercopithecines when resources are patchily distributed, highly nutritious, and defendable."
Subacromial space in african great apes and subacromial impingement syndrome in humans,"['Potau, JM', 'Bardina, X', 'Ciurana, N']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-007-9167-z,AUG 2007,4,"The subacromial space is the anatomical region limited superiorly by the acromion and the coracoacromial ligament and inferiorly by the glenoid fossa and the humeral head. In humans, the main tissues that form it and that can be affected by subacromial impingement syndrome are the subacromial bursa and the supraspinatus tendon. The syndrome is the most common degenerative pathology affecting the human shoulder, and it is characterized by an uncertain etiopathogenesis. We compared different anatomical parameters of the scapula related to the subacromial impingement syndrome in humans, between modern humans and 2 species of African apes (Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla). The 3 species we studied are orthograde primates and they present a similar structural pattern of the scapula and subacromial space, but anatomical differences exist owing to different types of locomotion used. The main differences indicate that African apes present a more curved and tilted acromion than humans, which does not, however, imply a difference in the relative size of the subacromial space among the 3 species studied. Humans also have a lower value of the relative size of the supraspinatus fossa than African great apes, and in human females have a relative lower value than males. We studied the anatomical structures of the shoulder in African apes that researchers have related to subacromial syndrome in humans to achieve a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of the syndrome."

In Experiment 1, subjects had to choose the larger of 2 quantities presented in 2 separate dishes either simultaneously or I dish after the other. Representatives of all species were capable of selecting the larger of 2 quantities in both conditions, even when the quantities were large and the numerical distance between them was small. In Experiment 2, subjects had to select between the same food quantities sequentially dropped into 2 opaque cups so that none of the quantities were ever viewed as a whole. The authors found some evidence (albeit weaker) that subjects were able to select the larger quantity of items. Furthermore, the authors found no performance breakdown with the inclusion of certain quantities. Instead, the ratio between quantities was the best performance predictor. The authors conclude that quantity-based judgments rely on an analogical system, not a discrete object file model or perceptual estimation mechanism, such as subitizing."
The ontogeny of sexual dimorphism in the facial skeleton of the African apes,"['Cobb, SN', ""O'Higgins, P""]",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.03.006,AUG 2007,29,"This paper aims to test the contribution of ontogenetic scaling to sexual dimorphism of the facial skeleton in the African apes. Specifically, it addresses whether males and females of each species share a common postnatal ontogenetic shape trajectory for the facial skeleton. Where trajectories are found to differ, it is tested whether male and female trajectories: 1) diverge early, or 2) diverge later after sharing a common trajectory earlier in the postnatal period. Where ontogenetic shape trajectories are found to be shared, it is also tested whether males and females are ontogenetically scaled. This study uses geometric morphometric analyses of 28 landmarks from the facial skeletons of 137 G. g. gorilla (62 adults; 75 juveniles), 95 P. paniscus (34 adults; 61 juveniles), and 115 P. t. troglodytes (58 adults; 57 juveniles). On average, males and females share a common ontogenetic shape trajectory until around the eruption of the second permanent molars. In addition, for the same period, males and females in each species share a common ontogenetic scaling trajectory. After this period, males and females diverge both from each other and from the common juvenile ontogenetic shape and scaling trajectories within each species. Thus, the male and female facial skeleton shows ontogenctic scaling until around the point of the eruption of the second molar (i.e., around puberty and the development of secondary sexual characteristics), but subsequent sexual dimorphism occurs via divergent trajectories and not via ontogenetic scaling.

Lessons from naked apes and their infections,"['Weiss, RA']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1111/j.1600-0684.2007.00235.x,AUG 2007,3,"Human infections come from two main sources. Our 'family heirlooms' have co-evolved with the host as we diverged from the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees, and these are often vertically transmitted. Our 'new acquisitions' come from cross-species infections, and these are typically horizontally transmitted. Compared with other apes, naked apes harbor a larger variety of pathogens, acquired from the domesticated and commensal non-primate species which share our habitat, as well as from exotic species. Thus we are nouveaux riches in our collection of infections or 'metagenome' and this is reviewed with particular reference to retroviruses. Nakedness poses a challenge to ectoparasites which is discussed in relation to the origin and evolution of human lice from those of the great apes. As humans have acquired infections horizontally from our closest living relatives, the chimpanzee and the gorilla, might we also have exchanged pathogens with other hominid species?"
Rethinking incisor size and diet in anthropoids: Incisor wear and incisor breadth in the African apes,"['McCollum, MA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20606,JUL 2007,10,"In a seminal study Hylander (1975) concluded that the length of the incisor row in catarrhines considered frugivores is longer relative to body mass than in those classified as folivores. Assuming that large fruits require greater incisal processing than do leaves, stems, berries, and seeds, he argued that the larger incisors of frugivores increased their resistance to wear. The present analysis examines diet, incisor wear, and incisor crown breadth in cranial samples of western lowland gorillas and chimpanzees. Incisor wear rate was assessed on the basis of the extent of incisor crown reduction observed at sequential stages of first molar wear. Incisor metrics were obtained from the unworn teeth of juveniles. Results suggest that incisor wear is greater in the more folivorous western lowland gorillas than in more frugivorous chimpanzees. Moreover, incisor crown dimensions do not differ appreciably among African apes. These findings fail to support the hypothesis that slower wear rates are associated with broader incisor crowns, and raise new questions regarding the significance of incisor row length in anthropoids."
"A socioecological perspective on primate cognition, past and present","['Cunningham, E', 'Janson, C']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-007-0078-3,JUL 2007,22,"The papers in this special issue examine the relationship between social and ecological cognition in primates. We refer to the intersection of these two domains as socioecological cognition. Examples of socioecological cognition include socially learned predator alarm calls and socially sensitive foraging decisions. In this review we consider how primate cognition may have been shaped by the interaction of social and ecological influences in their evolutionary history. The ability to remember distant, out-of-sight locations is an ancient one, shared by many mammals and widespread among primates. It seems some monkeys and apes have evolved the ability to form more complex representations of resources, integrating ""what-where-how much"" information. This ability allowed anthropoids to live in larger, more cohesive groups by minimizing competition for limited resources between group members. As group size increased, however, competition for resources also increased, selecting for enhanced social skills. Enhanced social skills in turn made a more sophisticated relationship to the environment possible. The interaction of social and ecological influences created a spiraling effect in the evolution of primate intelligence. In contrast, lemurs may not have evolved the ability to form complex representations which would allow them to consider the size and location of resources. This lack in lemur ecological cognition may restrict the size of frugivorous lemur social groups, thereby limiting the complexity of lemur social life. In this special issue, we have brought together two review papers, five field studies, and one laboratory study to investigate the interaction of social and ecological factors in relation to foraging. Our goal is to stimulate research that considers social and ecological factors acting together on cognitive evolution, rather than in isolation. Cross fertilization of experimental and observational studies from captivity and the field is important for increasing our understanding of this relationship."
Spider monkey ranging patterns in Mexican subtropical forest: do travel routes reflect planning?,"['Valero, A', 'Byrne, RW']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-006-0066-z,JUL 2007,32,"Although it is well known that frugivorous spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi yucatanensis) occupy large home ranges, travelling long distances to reach highly productive resources, little is known of how they move between feeding sites. A 11 month study of spider monkey ranging patterns was carried out at the Otochma'ax Yetel Kooh reserve, Yucatan, Mexico. We followed single individuals for as long as possible each day and recorded the routes travelled with the help of a GPS (Global Positioning System) device; the 11 independently moving individuals of a group were targeted as focal subjects. Travel paths were composed of highly linear segments, each typically ending at a place where some resource was exploited. Linearity of segments did not differ between individuals, and most of the highly linear paths that led to food resources were much longer than the estimate visibility in the woodland canopy. Monkeys do not generally continue in the same ranging direction after exploiting a resource: travel paths are likely to deviate at the site of resource exploitation rather than between such sites. However, during the harshest months of the year consecutive route segments were more likely to retain the same direction of overall movement. Together, these findings suggest that while moving between feeding sites, spider monkeys use spatial memory to guide travel, and even plan more than one resource site in advance."
The origins of HIV and implications for the global epidemic.,"['Van Heuverswyn, Fran', 'Peeters, Martine']",Current infectious disease reports,NA,2007-Jul,48,"HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) are the result of several cross-species transmissions from primates to humans. Recently, the ancestral strains of HIV-1 groups M and N were shown to still persist in today's wild chimpanzee populations (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in south Cameroon. Lately, HIV-1 group O-related viruses have been identified in western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), called SIVgor, but chimpanzees are most likely the original reservoir of this simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. HIV-2 is the result of at least eight distinct cross-species transmissions of SIV from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) in West Africa. Although the origin of HIV-1 and HIV-2 became clearer, some important questions concerning pathogenicity and epidemic spread of certain HIV/SIV variants need to be further elucidated. Because humans are still exposed to a plethora of primate lentiviruses through hunting and handling of primate bushmeat, the possibility of additional zoonotic transfers of primate lentiviruses from other primates must be considered."

Evolutionary history of chromosome 11 featuring four distinct centromere repositioning events in Catarrhini,"['Cardone, MF', 'Lomiento, M', 'Teti, MG', 'Misceo, D', 'Roberto, R', 'Capozzi, O', ""D'Addabbo, P"", 'Ventura, M', 'Rocchi, M', 'Archidiacono, N']",GENOMICS,10.1016/j.ygeno.2007.04.001,JUL 2007,13,"Panels of BAC clones used in FISH experiments allow a detailed definition of chromosomal marker arrangement and orientation during evolution. This approach has disclosed the centromere repositioning phenomenon, consisting in the activation of a novel, fully functional centromere in an ectopic location, concomitant with the inactivation of the old centromere. In this study, appropriate panels of BAC clones were used to track the chromosome I I evolutionary history in primates and nonprimate boreoeutherian mammals. Chromosome 11 synteny was found to be highly conserved in both primate and boreoeutherian mammalian ancestors. Amazingly, we detected four centromere repositioning events in primates (in Old World monkeys, in gibbons, in orangutans, and in the Homo-Pan-Gorilla (H-P-G) clade ancestor), and one in Equidae. Both HP-G and Lar gibbon novel centromeres were flanked by large duplicons with high sequence similarity. Outgroup species analysis revealed that this duplicon was absent in phylogenetically more distant primates. The chromosome 11 ancestral centromere was probably located near the HSA11q telomere. The domain of this inactivated centromere, in humans, is almost devoid of segmental duplications. An inversion occurred in chromosome 11 in the common ancestor of H-P-G. A large duplicon, again absent in outgroup species, was found located adjacent to the inversion breakpoints. In Hominoidea, almost all the five largest duplicons of this chromosome appeared involved in significant evolutionary architectural changes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Molar crown formation in the Late Miocene Asian hominoids, Sivapithecus parvada and Sivapithecus indicus","['Mahoney, P', 'Smith, TM', 'Schwartz, GT', 'Dean, C', 'Kelley, J']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.01.007,JUL 2007,12,"During the past decade, studies of enamel development have provided a broad temporal and geographic perspective on evolutionary developmental biology in Miocene hominoids.

Here we report some of the first data for molar crown development in one hominoid genus, Sivapithecus. The data are compared to a range of extant and extinct hominoids. Crown formation times (CFTs), daily rates of enamel secretion (DSR), Retzius line number and periodicity, and relative enamel thickness (RET) were calculated in a mandibular first molar of Sivapithecus parvada and a maxillary first molar of Sivapithecus indicus from the Siwalik sequence of Pakistan. A CFT of 2.40 years for the protoconid of S. parvada and 2.25 years for the protocone of S. indicus lie within the range of first molar (M I) formation times for the majority of Miocene hominoids (1.96-2.40 years, excluding Proconsul heseloni), and are similar to an M, from Gorilla (2.31 years) and M's from Pan (2.22-2.39 years). This is unlike the longer CFTs in modern humans, which appear to be linked with their extended growth period. In contrast to extant great apes and humans, daily rates of enamel secretion are rapid in the Sivapithecus M1s during the early stages of growth, which seems to be a common pattern for most Miocene apes. The rapid accumulation of cuspal enamel in the Sivapithecus molars produced thicker enamel than either Pan or Gorilla in a comparable period of time. Future studies on larger samples of living and fossil hominoids are needed to clarify trends in crown development, which may be better understood in the context of life history strategies coupled with good data on body mass and brain size.

We report here the resurrection of the core protein of a 4-million-year-old endogenous virus from the chimpanzee genome and show that the human variant of the intrinsic immune protein TRIM5 alpha can actively prevent infection by this virus. However, we suggest that selective changes that have occurred in the human lineage during the acquisition of resistance to this virus, and perhaps similar viruses, may have left our species more susceptible to infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)."

Here we demonstrate the promise and pitfalls of this approach using DNA extracted from fecal samples of wild western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and black and white colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza). From these DNA extracts we amplified, cloned, and sequenced small segments of chloroplast DNA (part of the rbcL gene) and plant nuclear DNA (ITS-2). The obtained sequences were compared to sequences generated from known plant samples and to those in GenBank to identify plant taxa in the feces. With further optimization, this method could provide a basic evaluation of minimum primate dietary diversity even when knowledge of local flora is limited. This approach may find application in studies characterizing the diets of poorly-known, unhabituated primate species or assaying consumer-resource relationships in an ecosystem."
A review on reproductive biotechnologies for conservation of endangered mammalian species,"['Andrabi, SMH', 'Maxwell, WMC']",ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE,10.1016/j.anireprosci.2006.07.002,JUN 2007,83,"This review describes the use of modem reproductive biotechnologies or assisted reproductive techniques (ART) including artificial insemination, embryo transfer/sexing, in vitro fertilization, gamete/embryo micromanipulation, semen sexing, genome resource banking, and somatic cell nuclear transfer (cloning) in conservation programs for endangered mammalian species. Such biotechnologies allow more offspring to be obtained from selected parents to ensure genetic diversity and may reduce the interval between generations. However, the application of reproductive biotechnologies for endangered free-living mammals is rarer than for endangered domestic breeds. Progress in ART for non-domestic species will continue at a slow pace due to limited resources, but also because the management and conservation of endangered species is biologically quite complex. In practice, current reproductive biotechnologies are species-specific or inefficient for many endangered animals because of insufficient knowledge on basic reproduction like estrous cycle, seasonality, structural anatomy, gamete physiology and site for semen deposition or embryo transfer of non-domestic species.

Assessing the effects of new primate exhibits on zoo visitors' attitudes and perceptions by using three different assessment methods,"['Nakamichi, M']",ANTHROZOOS,10.2751/175303707X207945,JUN 2007,7,"Using three different methods, this study investigated how zoo visitors behaved in response to both old and new exhibits of four nonhuman primate species and how they perceived these primates. On-site observations showed that zoo visitors were more likely to stop in front of new exhibits and spend more time viewing new exhibits compared with old exhibits. Response to an on-site questionnaire also showed that zoo visitors perceived primates in the new exhibits more positively than the same animals in the old exhibits. The results from these two types of local assessment indicate that the attractiveness and holding power of the new exhibits was greater than that of the old. However, the results of a questionnaire given to zoo visitors on leaving the zoo showed that the preference ranks of the visitors for the four primate species did not increase after the new exhibits were established, indicating that the new ex-hibits did not change the zoo visitors' perception of primates relative to other zoo animals. Using all three assessment methods appears to be of considerable value for the assessment of visitors' perceptions towards new exhibits in terms of both the immediate locality and the zoo as a whole."
"The evolution of foresight: What is mental time travel, and is it unique to humans?","['Suddendorf, T', 'Corballis, MC', 'AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY']",BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES,10.1017/S0140525X07001975,JUN 2007,499,"In a dynamic world, mechanisms allowing prediction of future situations call provide a selective advantage. We suggest that memory systems differ in the degree of flexibility they offer for anticipatory behavior and put forward a corresponding taxonomy of prospection. The adaptive advantage of any memory system can only lie in what it contributes for future survival. The most flexible is episodic memory, which we suggest is part of a more general faculty of mental time travel that allows us not only to go back in time, but also to foresee, plan, and shape virtually any specific future event. We review comparative studies and find that, in spite of increased research in the area, there is as yet no convincing evidence for mental time travel in nonhuman animals. We submit that mental time travel is not an encapsulated cognitive system, but instead comprises several subsidiary mechanisms. A theater metaphor serves as an analogy for the kind of mechanisms required for effective mental time travel. We propose that future research should consider these mechanisms in addition to direct evidence of future-directed action. We maintain that the emergence of mental time travel in evolution was a crucial step towards our current success."

DNA degradation in hair roots is caused by apoptosis as part of the cycle of hair growth and by autolysis in decomposing animals. Shed hairs are additionally exposed to degenerative environmental processes. However, genetic studies rarely examine hair root morphologies or refer to root growth phases prior to analysis, and detailed knowledge of the rapidity of DNA degradation amongst shed hairs is lacking. We examined the effects of biological and environmental processes on western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla Savage and Wyman) hair roots with respect to morphological characteristics and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) success at eight nuclear loci. Root type frequencies indicate that gorilla body hairs may exhibit a longer telogen phase than human head hairs. All plucked hair root types amplified more efficiently than shed hairs, and only 41% of shed hairs had root types considered suitable for genotyping. Telogen hairs from fresh nests were four-fold more useful for genotyping if the roots were associated with translucent epithelial tissue, and preselection of these root types doubled the overall data-yield to 58%. Nest age correlated with root morphology and PCR success, and PCR success was almost halved after 3 days of exposure. Finally, an association between postmortem interval, root morphology, and PCR success was observed that was consistent with postmortem changes reported in human head hairs.

Recent studies imply observed differences in transthyretin (TTR) as a unique feature in human evolution. We studied differences in the molecular heterogeneity of plasma TTR between humans and great apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orang-utan) using a mass spectrometry immumoassay. Compared to humans, TTR levels were higher in chimpanzees and lower in orang-utans (both P<0.05). In all species, four major mass signals were observed. In humans, mass signals were at 13,755 4, 13,875 4 (greatest intensity), 13,935 +/- 8 and 14,053 +/- 10 Da representing native, S-cysteinylated, S-cysteinglycinylated and glutathionylated TTR, respectively. In chimpanzees and bonobos molecular masses were slightly lower than in humans (7-8 Da), whilst in gorillas and orang-utans masses of TTR adducts were respectively 20 and 100 Da lower (P < 0.05). Peak pattern and relationship to each other was similar in all species. The close relationship between humans and chimpanzees is reflected in the similarity of their post-translational modification of TTR whilst mutations on the amino acid level are indicated. Results represent a proteomic distinction between humans and great apes with the possibility of resulting functional consequences. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

An epidemiological model is presented to describe the combined effects of Ebola and hunting on persistence of gorillas. The number of infected gorillas also provides a means of assessing the risk of transmission to humans. Under current harvest practices and the estimated annual outbreak rate, the gorilla population is predicted to undergo a 97 % decline within 100 years.

Data from relatively few genotypes permitted the identification of female transfer events and the interpretation of individual behavior that was previously impossible using observational methods, thus providing rare behavioral data on an elusive forest-dwelling species. Importantly, this study highlights the need for future studies of dispersal and local population structuring in forest populations, and more accurate population census methods. Genetic studies focusing on individual identification may play a valuable role in future gorilla conservation efforts."

Researchers have hypothesized that the unusually high quality of foliage at Nyungwe allows colobus there to avoid intragroup feeding competition, releasing constraints on the formation of large groups (Fimbel et al., 2001). We collected data on the activity and ranging patterns of a > 300-member Nyungwe colobus group and compared our results to those from smaller groups in other black-and-white colobus (Colobus spp.) populations. Colobus at Nyungwe spent far more time feeding and moving (62%) and far less time resting (32%) than black-and-white colobus at any other site. The annual home range of the Nyungwe colobus was also many times larger (95% minimum convex polygon: 20.7 km(2); 95% fixed kernel: 24.4 km(2)) than those for other populations. We terminated our research after the group engaged in an unprecedented migration among black-and-white colobus by moving 13 km south of their former range. Our results suggest that intragroup scramble competition may be more intense than originally believed within the large colobus groups at Nyungwe and that long periods of resource renewal may be necessary after a large colobus group passes through an area, thereby potentially helping to explain their wide ranging patterns. We discuss the socioecological convergence between the Nyungwe colobus and Chinese snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus spp.) and suggest directions for future research on the unique black-and-white colobus population at Nyungwe."

New data on elementary technology employed in extractive foraging (e.g., ant dipping) show that prevailing ideas of environmental versus cultural determinism are simplistic. Cultural primatology yields both behavioral diversity and universals. As with humans, cultural change can be maladaptive (e.g., pestle pounding, crop raiding) as well as adaptive.

Direct observations suggest that immature females have more opportunities to move between breeding groups than immature males. The distribution of kin dyadic relationships within and between groups does not, however, support this hypothesis. At larger geographical scales, dispersal is likely to be easier for males than females because of the solitary phase most blackbacks experience before founding their own breeding group. However, previous work indicates that males settle preferentially close to male kin. By specifically tracing female and male lineages with mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal genetic markers, we found that male gorillas in the 6000 km(2) area we surveyed form a single population whereas females are restricted to the individual sites we sampled and do not freely move around this area. These differences are more correctly described as differences in dispersal distances, rather than differences in dispersal rates between sexes (both sexes emigrate from their natal group in this species). Differences in resource competition and dispersal costs between female and male gorillas are compatible with the observed pattern, but more work is needed to understand if these ultimate causes are responsible for sex-biased dispersal distances in western lowland gorillas."

The site has supported a free-ranging population without provisioning for 40 years. Our goals were to determine whether Rubondo chimpanzees experience periods of fruit shortage, and whether they respond to changes in fruit availability similarly to chimpanzees at endemic sites. We indexed the fruit availability of tree and liana species on transects stratified across three chimpanzee ranging areas. We used fecal analyses to evaluate seasonal changes in diet, and used data on party size and nesting group size to examine seasonal patterns of grouping. Tree fruit availability was positively correlated with rainfall, with a period of relative tree fruit scarcity corresponding with the long dry season. Liana fruit availability was not related to rainfall, and lianas exhibited less variable fruiting patterns across seasons. Fruits made up the majority of the chimpanzee diet, with lianas accounting for 35% of dietary fruit species. Fruits of the liana Saba comorensis were available during all months of phenological monitoring, but they were consumed more when tree fruit was scarce, suggesting that Saba comorensis fruits Pay be a fallback food for Rubondo chimpanzees. There were no increases in consumption of lower-quality plant parts between seasons, and there were no changes in group size between seasons. These results contrast with evidence from several endemic chimpanzee study sites, and indicate that Rubondo chimpanzees may have access to abundant and high-quality foods year round."
Another gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) recognizes himself in a mirror,"['Posada, S', 'Colell, M']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20355,MAY 2007,10,"Various attempts have been made to explain why gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) find it difficult to recognize their mirror image. One of the most oft-cited reasons is aversion to eye contact, which stops gorillas from looking into a mirror and thus prevents them from carrying out a suitable exploration that could lead to self-recognition. In the experimental design used here the subject was first habituated both to observers and to the mirror as an object before being exposed to the latter. The study was performed with a single subject who was well adapted to captivity and exhibited no aberrant behavior or signs of stress. The results revealed that the subject had no aversion to eye contact. He showed considerable interest in the mirror and appeared relaxed when faced with his image. He gave a positive response to the mark test."

Hunting of mammals reduces seed removal and dispersal of the afrotropical tree Antrocaryon klaineanum (Anacardiaceae),"['Wang, BC', 'Sork, VL', 'Leong, MT', 'Smith, TB']",BIOTROPICA,10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00275.x,MAY 2007,51,"Throughout the tropics, mammalian seed dispersers are being driven to local extinction by intense hunting pressure, generating concern not only about the loss of these species, but also about the consequences for the plants they disperse. We compared two rain forest sites in Cameroon-one with heavy hunting pressure and one protected from hunting-to appraise the loss of mammalian seed dispersers and to assess the impact of this loss on seed removal and seed dispersal of Antrocaryon klaineanum (Anacardiaceae), a mammal-dispersed tree. Surveys of arboreal frugivores indicate that three of the five monkey species, as well as chimpanzee and gorilla, have been extirpated from the hunted forest. Diaspore counts underneath A. klaineanum adults (six trees per site) indicate that seed removal is severely reduced in the hunted forest. Finally, genetic maternity exclusion analysis (using 3-7 nuclear microsatellite loci) of maternally inherited endocarp tissue from diaspores collected under the canopies of 12 fruiting ""mother"" trees (six trees per site) revealed that seed dispersal in the hunted forest is also greatly reduced. In the hunted forest with reduced mammal dispersal agents, only 1 of the 53 assayed endocarps (2%) did not match the mother and was determined to be from a dispersed diaspore. By contrast, in the protected forest, 20 of the 48 assayed endocarps (42%) were from dispersed diaspores. This study provides strong evidence that loss of dispersal agents can lead to reduced seed removal and loss of seed dispersal, disrupting the seed dispersal cycle."
Fine-tuning of social play in juvenile lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Palagi, E', 'Antonacci, D', 'Cordoni, G']",DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY,10.1002/dev.20219,MAY 2007,19,"Social play, which involves cooperation, communication, and learning, may represent a suitable field for the investigation of cognitive ability in a given species. We collected data on a captive group of gorillas in order to evaluate the potential cognitive skill of juveniles in fine-tuning play behavior This study revealed that juvenile gorillas are able to ""place"" the play session in a proper spatial/temporal context, thus evaluating a complex net of factors (e.g., play partner, play roughness, group activity, space availability). When animals play fight, they use patterns of agonistic functional contexts. Since these actions are not intrinsically different from their ""serious"" context, it may be hard to distinguish them. One of the most important function of play in the ontogeny of primate social cognition may be to recognize stimuli, which may indicate the intentions of conspecifics. Accordingly, we found that juvenile gorillas are able to use play signals appropriately when a clear statement of purpose is necessary (i.e., during male-male competitive play sessions and when the escape opportunities are limited). The ability to interpret such ambiguous features of social signaling could represent a central issue in the evolution of behavioral flexibility and intelligence in primates.

Tempo and mode of evolution of the Rh blood group genes before and after gene duplication,"['Kitano, T', 'Umetsu, K', 'Tian, W', 'Yamazaki, K', 'Saitou, N']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s00251-007-0204-z,MAY 2007,0,"The Rh blood group genes became duplicated in a common ancestor of human-chimpanzee-gorilla. We compared the evolutionary rates of the Rh blood group genes for each exon for branches connecting to humans, having duplicated Rh loci, and to orangutan, gibbon, and Old World monkeys, species having a single Rh locus. Our results show that evolutionary rates of nonsynonymous substitutions at exon 7 became accelerated in the human lineage. Furthermore, we surveyed the sequence variation in the region surrounding exon 7 of gibbons to clarify whether the diversity of the human exon 7 was introduced after the duplication or had been maintained before it. Two amino acid polymorphisms in white-handed gibbons were observed in the immediate vicinity of the D-specific motif in the human exon 7. Although the evolutionary rate of exon 7 was accelerated after the gene duplication, our results suggest that exon 7 had the potential for change even before the gene duplication."
Response of captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) to different housing conditions: Testing the aggression-density and coping models,"['Cordoni, G', 'Palagi, E']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/0735-7036.121.2.171,MAY 2007,9,"Several studies have suggested that primates react differently to spatial reduction. In this article, the authors tested some general hypotheses on primate response to spatial reduction by studying the Apenheul lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla; Apeldoorn, the Netherlands). The frequency of conflicts did not greatly change between the 2 housing settings, thus not supporting the density-aggression model. Indoor, gorillas performed touching behavior more often and increased their level of reconciliation. These findings support the coping model. Indoor, the gorillas also maintained broader interindividual distances by increasing the levels of sitting alone, avoidance, and dismissing behaviors. In conclusion, the Apenheul gorillas modified selectively the distribution of some patterns typical of their behavioral repertoire in response to a high-density condition.

Distinguishing gorilla mitochondrial sequences from nuclear integrations and PCR recombinants: Guidelines for their diagnosis in complex sequence databases,"['Anthony, NM', 'Clifford, SL', 'Bawe-Johnson, M', 'Abernethy, KA', 'Bruford, MW', 'Wickings, EJ']",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.ympev.2006.09.013,MAY 2007,29,"Nuclear integrations of mitochondrial DNA (Numts) are widespread in many taxa and if left undetected can confound phylogeny interpretation and bias estimates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity. This is particularly true in gorillas, where recent studies suggest multiple integrations of the first hypervariable (HV1) domain of the mitochondrial control region. Problems can also arise through the inadvertent incorporation of artifacts produced by in vitro recombination between sequence types during polymerase chain reaction amplification. This issue has attracted little attention yet could potentially exacerbate errors in databases already contaminated by Numts. Using a set of existing diagnostic tools, this study set out to systematically inventory Numts and PCR recombinants in a gorilla HV1 sequence database and address the degree to which existing public databases are contaminated. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three distinct gorilla HV1 Numt groups (I, II, and III) that could be readily differentiated from mtDNA sequences by Numt-specific diagnostic sites and sequence-based motifs. Several instances of genuine recombination were also identified by a suite of detection methods. The location of putative breakpoints was identified by eye and by likelihood analysis. Findings from this study reveal widespread nuclear contamination of gorilla HV1 GenBank databases and underline the importance of recognizing not only Numts but also PCR recombinant artifacts as potential sources of data contamination. Guidelines for the routine identification of Numts and in vitro recombinants are presented and should prove useful in the detection of similar artifacts in other species mtDNA databases.

However, knowledge about how this skill differs between species and whether it shows a relationship with genetic distance from humans is still fragmentary. In the present study of gaze following in great apes, we manipulated the nature of a visual obstruction and the presence/absence of a target. We found that bonobos, chimpanzees, and gorillas followed gaze significantly more often when the obstruction had a window than when it did not, just as human infants do. Additionally, bonobos and chimpanzees looked at the experimenter's side of a windowless obstruction more often than the other species. Moreover, bonobos produced more double looks when the barrier was opaque than when it had a window, indicating an understanding of what other individuals see. The most distant human relatives studied, orangutans, showed few signs of understanding what another individual saw. Instead, they were attracted to the target's location by the target's presence, but not by the experimenter's gaze. Great apes' perspective-taking skills seem to have increased in the evolutionary lineage leading to bonobos, chimpanzees, and humans."

Why Ebola has emerged so explosively remains poorly understood. Previous studies have tended to focus on exogenous factors such as habitat disturbance and climate change as drivers of Ebola emergence while downplaying the contribution of transmission between gorilla or chimpanzee social groups. Here we report recent observations on behaviors that pose a risk of transmission among gorilla groups and between gorillas and chimpanzees. These observations support a reassessment of ape-to-ape transmission as an amplifier of Ebola outbreaks."
Culture in great apes: using intricate complexity in feeding skills to trace the evolutionary origin of human technical prowess,"['Byrne, RW']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2006.1996,APR 29 2007,33,"Geographical cataloguing of traits, as used in human ethnography, has led to the description of 'culture' in some non-human great apes. Culture, in these terms, is detected as a pattern of local ignorance resulting from environmental constraints on knowledge transmission. However, in many cases, the geographical variations may alternatively be explained by ecology. Social transmission of information can reliably be identified in many other animal species, by experiment or distinctive patterns in distribution; but the excitement of detecting culture in great apes derives from the possibility of understanding the evolution of cumulative technological culture in humans. Given this interest, I argue that great ape research should concentrate on technically complex behaviour patterns that are ubiquitous within a local population; in these cases, a wholly non-social ontogeny is highly unlikely. From this perspective, cultural transmission has an important role in the elaborate feeding skills of all species of great ape, in conveying the 'gist' or organization of skills. In contrast, social learning is unlikely to be responsible for local stylistic differences, which are apt to reflect sensitive adaptations to ecology."

A study of nuclear DNA from the two species of wild gorillas offers a glimpse of their mysterious past and of how new species of primates arise. These shy herbivores turn out to have diverged slowly into two species, apparently taking the better part of a million years, according to molecular anthropologist Linda Vigilant of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Previous studies of the paternally inherited Y chromosome from gorillas suggested that the two species, eastern gorillas and western gorillas, interbred until recently. But maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA suggested that they separated more than 1 million years ago."

Gorilla-like anatomy on Australopithecus afarensis mandibles suggests Au. afarensis link to robust australopiths","['Rak, Y', 'Ginzburg, A', 'Geffen, E']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0606454104,APR 17 2007,14,"Mandibular ramus morphology on a recently discovered specimen of Australopithecus afarensis closely matches that of gorillas. This finding was unexpected given that chimpanzees are the closest living relatives of humans. Because modern humans, chimpanzees, orangutans, and many other primates share a ramal morphology that differs from that of gorillas, the gorilla anatomy must represent a unique condition, and its appearance in fossil hominins must represent an independently derived morphology. This particular morphology appears also in Australopithecus robustus. The presence of the morphology in both the latter and Au. afarensis and its absence in modern humans cast doubt on the role of Au. afarensis as a modern human ancestor. The ramal anatomy of the earlier Ardipithecus ramidus is virtually that of a chimpanzee, corroborating the proposed phylogenetic scenario."
Yaws disease in a wild gorilla population and its impact on the reproductive status of males,"['Levrero, F', 'Gatti, S', 'Gautier-Hion, A', 'Menard, N']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20560,APR 2007,12,"We evaluated the prevalence of skin lesions in a gorilla population in the Republic of Congo. The observed lesions were typical of yaws, a treponematosis described in gorillas and humans living in tropical regions. Among the 377 gorillas identified, 17% presented skin lesions, mainly on their faces. The worst cases presented physical handicaps because of the deep lesions. As in humans, lesions break out when individuals are young. Lesions were more prevalent among males than females above 8 years old. This sex-bias prevalence could result from the behavioral characteristics of males through a greater exposure to wounds. Lesions were also more prevalent in unmated adult males (either solitaries or those living in nonbreeding groups) than in males leading breeding groups. In the case of the latter, nonaffected and affected leading males had a similar number of infants and juveniles. Still, none of the leading males ever presented serious handicaps because of the skin lesions. This suggests that adult females could favor males without lesions. Finally, lesions were more prevalent among immature animals in nonbreeding groups than in breeding groups, suggesting that either young animals with lesions disperse earlier from their natal groups, or that the disease spreads faster in nonbreeding groups. Our results provide some insights into the spread of a disease in a wild population. Further studies are required to determine if the vigor of males affects the development of the disease and if affected individuals experience social discrimination inducing a negative impact on population dynamics."
Invisible displacement understanding in domestic dogs (Canis familiaris): the role of visual cues in search behavior,"['Fiset, S', 'LeBlanc, V']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-006-0060-5,APR 2007,34,"Recently, (Collier-Baker E, Davis JM, Suddendorf T (2004) J Comp Psychol 118:421-433) suggested that domestic dogs do not understand invisible displacements. In the present study, we further investigated the hypothesis that the search behavior of domestic dogs in invisible displacements is guided by various visual cues inherent to the task rather than by mental representation of an object's past trajectory. Specifically, we examined the role of the experimenter as a function of the final position of the displacement device in the search behavior of domestic dogs. Visible and invisible displacement problems were administered to dogs (N = 11) under two conditions. In the Visible-experimenter condition, the experimenter was visible whereas in the Concealed-experimenter condition, the experimenter was visibly occluded behind a large rigid barrier. Our data supported the conclusion that dogs do not understand invisible displacements but primarily search as a function of the final position of the displacement device and, to a lesser extent, the position of the experimenter."
Socioecological influences on the reproductive success of female mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei),"['Robbins, MM', 'Robbins, AM', 'Gerald-Steklis, N', 'Steklis, HD']",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,10.1007/s00265-006-0321-y,APR 2007,41,"Over the past few decades, socioecological models have been developed to explain the relationships between the ecological conditions, social systems, and reproductive success of primates. Feeding competition, predation pressures, and risk of infanticide are predicted to influence how female reproductive success (FRS) depends upon their dominance rank, group size, and mate choices. This paper examines how those factors affected the reproductive success of female mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) of the Virunga Volcanoes, Rwanda from 1967-2004. Reproductive success was measured through analyses of interbirth intervals, infant survival, and surviving infant birth rates using data from 214 infants born to 67 females. Mountain gorillas were predicted to have ""within-group scramble"" feeding competition, but we found no evidence of lower FRS in larger groups, even as those groups became two to five times larger than the population average. The gorillas are considered to have negligible ""within-group contest"" competition, yet higher ranked mothers had shorter interbirth intervals. Infant survival was higher in multimale groups, which was expected because infanticide occurs when the male dies in a one-male group. The combination of those results led to higher surviving birth rates for higher ranking females in multimale groups. Overall, however, the socioecological factors accounted for a relatively small portion of the variance in FRS, as expected for a species that feeds on abundant, evenly distributed foliage."
Patterns of gastrointestinal bacterial exchange between chimpanzees and humans involved in research and tourism in western Uganda,"['Goldberg, TL', 'Gillespie, TR', 'Rwego, IB', 'Wheeler, E', 'Estoff, EL', 'Chapman, CA']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2006.10.048,APR 2007,47,"Ecological overlap may increase the risks of microbial exchange between humans and wild non-human primates. Escherichia coli bacteria were collected from chimpanzees and humans in Kibale National Park, western Uganda, in May and June 2004, in order to examine whether interaction between humans and apes in the wild might affect gastrointestinal bacterial communities in the two species. Chimpanzees harbored bacteria genetically more similar to those of humans employed in chimpanzee-directed research and tourism than to those of humans from a local village. Most humans (81.6%) and 4.4% of chimpanzees harbored at least one isolate resistant to locally available antibiotics. In isolates from both humans and chimpanzees, resistance was higher to five of these antibiotics than to Ceftiofur, an antibiotic not available in the region. These data indicate that humans and apes interacting in the wild can share genetically and phenotypically similar gastrointestinal bacteria, presumably originating from common environmental sources. Strategies to limit transmission of pathogens between humans and primates, whether that transmission is direct or indirect, would benefit both human health and primate conservation.

Different evolutionary fates of recently integrated human and chimpanzee LINE-1 retrotransposons,"['Lee, J', 'Cordaux, R', 'Han, KD', 'Wang, JX', 'Hedges, DJ', 'Liang, P', 'Batzer, MA']",GENE,10.1016/j.gene.2006.08.029,APR 1 2007,27,"The long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is a highly successful retrotransposon in mammals. L1 elements have continued to actively propagate subsequent to the human-chimpanzee divergence, similar to 6 million years ago, resulting in species-specific inserts. Here, we report a detailed characterization of chimpanzee-specific L1 subfamily diversity and a comparison with their human-specific counterparts. Our results indicate that L1 elements have experienced different evolutionary fates in humans and chimpanzees within the past similar to 6 million years. Although the species-specific L1 copy numbers are on the same order in both species (1200-2000 copies), the number of retrotransposition-competent elements appears to be much higher in the human genome than in the chimpanzee genome. Also, while human L1 subfamilies belong to the same lineage, we identified two lineages of recently integrated L1 subfamilies in the chimpanzee genome. The two lineages seem to have coexisted for several million years, but only one shows evidence of expansion within the past three million years. These differential evolutionary paths may be the result of random variation, or the product of competition between L1 subfamily lineages. Our results suggest that the coexistence of several L1 subfamily lineages within a species may be resolved in a very short evolutionary period of time, perhaps in just a few million years. Therefore, the chimpanzee genome constitutes an excellent model in which to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of L1 retrotransposons. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Full-length sequence analysis of the HLA-DRB1 locus suggests a recent origin of alleles,"['von Salome, J', 'Gyllensten, U', 'Bergstrom, TF']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s00251-007-0196-8,APR 2007,31,"The HLA region harbors some of the most polymorphic loci in the human genome. Among them is the class II locus HLA-DRB1, with more than 400 known alleles. The age of the polymorphism and the rate at which new alleles are generated at HLA loci has caused much controversy over the years. Previous studies have mostly been restricted to the 270 base pairs that constitute the second exon and represent the most variable part of the gene. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of the HLA-DRB1 locus on the basis of an analysis of 15 genomic full-length alleles (10-15 kb). In addition, the variation in 49 complete coding sequences and 322 exon 2 sequences were analyzed. When excluding exon 2 from the analysis, the diversity at the synonymous sites was found to be similar to the intron diversity. The overall diversity in noncoding region was also similar to the genome average. The DRB1*03 lineage has been found in human, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and orangutan. An ancestral ""proto HLA-DRB1*03 lineage"" appeared to have diverged in the last 5 million years into the human-specific lineages *08, *11, *13, and *14. With exception to exon 2, both the coding- and the noncoding diversity suggests a recent origin (< 1 million years ago) for most of the alleles at the HLA-DRB1 locus. Sites encoding for amino acids involved in antigen binding [antigen recognizing sites (ARS)] appear to have a more ancient origin. Taken together, the recent origin of most alleles, the high diversity between allelic lineages, and the ancient origin of sequence motifs in exon 2, is consistent with a relatively rapid generation of novel alleles by gene conversion like events."

Our objectives were to compare the intestinal parasites of free-ranging, semicaptive, and captive orangutans and to evaluate the risk of parasite transmission in orangutan reintroduction programs. We identified 4 genera of Protozoa, 7 genera of nematodes, 1 trematode sp., and 1 cestode sp. The prevalence of Balantidium coli in free-ranging orangutans was significantly higher than in captive individuals. However, the prevalence of Strongyloides sp. was higher in captive than in free-ranging orangutans. Free-ranging female orangutans had a significantly higher total prevalence of intestinal parasites than that of males. We found no significant difference between parasite prevalences in different age groups. Compared to gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans carry a smaller variety of protozoan and nematode species. Strongyloides sp. infections form the highest risk in reintroduction programs as crowding, ground-dwelling, and poor hygiene in captive and semicaptive orangutans may cause a constant reinfection."
"Development of independence from the mother in Gorilla gorilla gorilla
","['Nowell, AA', 'Fletcher, AW']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-007-9128-6,APR 2007,21,"In gorillas, the mother takes full responsibility for carrying and feeding offspring, and lactational amenorrhea prevents her from investing in another offspring while suckling. Therefore, mothers should encourage immature gorillas to become gradually more independent until they are physically able to acquire sufficient resources, travel independently, and manage social relationships unaided. We investigated the development of independence in a population of wild western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Mbeli Bai, Nouabale-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo. We observed the spatial proximity, the development of travel, patterns of suckling and weaning, and the nature of mother-offspring interactions for 42 immature gorillas to investigate the nature of the relationship between mother and offspring. Though mother-offspring distance and independent travel increased during immaturity, with few active interactions between the dyads, offspring still continued to suckle until a median age of 4.6 yr, longer than in mountain gorillas. The tolerance of the mother toward suckling by older offspring may reflect the importance of continued nutritional investment: the temporal nature of the diet of western gorillas means that succulent fruits-likely to be preferred weaning foods-are not always available. We propose that to buffer against potential fruit shortage, mothers continue to nurse their offspring to decrease the likelihood of death from care-dependent factors and to improve an offspring's chances of survival."

Our study of 2 well monitored groups of western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Bai Hokou in Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African Republic provides information on frequency and variability of termite consumption (the most commonly eaten insect) as well as some of the first direct observations of the behavior. Pooled data from both groups indicate termite feeding on 34% and 83% of days, through fecal analysis and feeding trails, respectively. Direct observations revealed that termite feeding occurred on 91% of the days for 1 group, in which the silverback fed on termites during 13% of all feeding scans, making termites the most commonly observed food item. The group that had a higher density of termite mounds in its home range consumed termites more frequently than the other group did. A higher proportion of fecal samples from the silverbacks contained termite remains than the ones from adult females and juveniles. Termite consumption was lower during the dry season, but it does not correlate with rainfall, measures of fruit availability, or fruit consumption. Displacements at termite mounds occurred more than expected, indicating that they are a patchy, sought-after food resource. Gorillas did not use tools to extract termites, but they used 2 different techniques to remove them from the cells. Though culture or social traditions may cause the variation in termite consumption across sites, further investigation of termite availability and consumption is necessary to rule out ecological and methodological explanations for observed variations."
Distinguishing between the nests of sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas,"['Sanz, C', 'Morgan, D', 'Strindberg, S', 'Onononga, JR']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01278.x,APR 2007,24,"Our current inability to estimate precisely the population sizes of chimpanzees and gorillas across much of the Congo Basin has been detrimental to the development of conservation strategies for the preservation of these endangered apes. Systematic counts of nests are currently the most commonly used method to estimate ape abundance, but distinguishing between the nests of sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas has proven to be an enduring obstacle to estimating species-specific abundance. In general, the builder of more than 75% of nests recorded during surveys is undetermined. We hypothesized that sleeping habits and nest building patterns would allow us to differentiate between the nests of these apes.

We constructed a predictive model using stepwise discriminant function analysis to determine characteristics that accurately distinguished between chimpanzee and gorilla nests. We analysed 13 variables associated with 3425 ape nests from three independent surveys conducted in the Goualougo Triangle of the Nouabale-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo.

The model correctly classified more than 90% of nests in our validation subsample. Nest height, nest type, forest type and understorey closure were identified as important variables for distinguishing between chimpanzee and gorilla nests at this site. Attributing nests to either species increased the precision of resulting density estimates, which enhanced the statistical power to detect trends in population fluctuation.

Although specific variables may differ between study sites, we have demonstrated that predictive models to distinguish between the nests of sympatric chimpanzee and gorillas provide a promising approach to improving the quality of ape survey data.

Synthesis and applications. Our study introduces an innovative solution to the dilemma of discriminating between the nests of sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas, which increases the specificity and precision of resulting ape abundance estimates. There is an urgent need to improve methods to evaluate and monitor remaining ape populations across western and central Africa that are experiencing the imminent threats of emergent diseases, poaching and expanding human development. Increasing the quality of density estimates from field survey data will aid in the development of local conservation initiatives, national strategies and international policies on behalf of remaining ape populations."

Of disturbed forest samples, red colobus (Pilocolobus tephrosceles) and red-tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius) harbored species of Cryptosporidium or Giardia, but black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza) did not. All primate samples from undisturbed forest were negative for both parasites. Seven of 35 (20%) red colobus and 1 of 20 red-tailed guenons (5%) from forest fragments were infected with either Cryptosporidium sp. or Giardia sp. The presence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia species in primates living in forest fragments, but not in primates in undisturbed forest, suggests that habitat disturbance may play a role in transmission or persistence of these pathogens."
Gorillas in the midst: the impact of armed conflict on the conservation of protected areas in sub-Saharan Africa,"['Glew, L', 'Hudson, MD']",ORYX,10.1017/S003060530700175,APR 2007,12,"The frequently anecdotal nature of evidence concerning the impact of warfare on conservation poses numerous problems and there have been calls to apply a strict set of conditions to such data to improve the rigor of scientific analysis in this field. To illustrate the difficulties, however, of applying strict quantitative conditions on such data a deterministic model of conflict-linked deforestation in sub-Saharan Africa was constructed and the implications of the model discussed. Our model indicates that from 1990-2005 approximately 35,000 ha of timber have been used to support officially recorded UN refugees in this region: this is a continuing impact, albeit quantified using data with some potential error. An alternative semi-quantitative approach was also used, with reported environmental impacts of conflict assessed for reliability and severity using a number of empirical criteria. Data focusing on the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda were subsequently analysed using this framework. Illegal resource exploitation was identified as the primary impact resulting from conflict and, in some instances, a driver of the hostilities. From the joint consideration of the conflict and post-conflict phases such exploitation is concluded to be the product of lawlessness and anarchy generated by violent uprisings rather than violence per se. As such, armed conflict does not pose a novel threat to protected areas but rather amplifies threats extant during peace, creating a need for appropriate responses by those involved in conservation management. With both the occurrence and violence of conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa increasing, the impacts of warfare are pertinent to both the immediate and long-term management of biological resources in the region."
Comparative analysis of estrogen receptor gene polymorphisms in apes,"['Hong, KW', 'Iwatsuki, H', 'Takenaka, O', 'Hayasaka, I', 'Murayama, Y', 'Ito, S', 'Inoue-Murayama, M']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s-10329-006-0014-1,APR 2007,1,"Polymorphic microsatellite repeats in the promoter region of estrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR alpha and the intron 6 region of estrogen receptor beta gene (ESR beta) have been reported in human populations. To examine the evolutional state of both repeats, we surveyed the corresponding regions in DNA sequences from the following great apes and gibbons: 56 chimpanzees, 3 bonobos, 16 gorillas, 20 orangutans and 60 gibbons (four species: 17 of Hylobates agilis, 11 of H. lar, 15 of H. muelleri, and 17 of H. syndactylus). In the corresponding region of the TA repeat of human ESRa, chimpanzees and bonobos had two motifs in the repeat tract, (TA)(7-9) and (CA)(4-6). Gorillas had the (TA)(9-10) repeat tracts and orangutans had monomorphic (TA)(7) repeats. Although all great apes maintained the TA expansion, all gibbon sequences contained (TA)(2), implying that the CA dinucleotide expansion arose in the ancestor of chimpanzees and bonobos. The nucleotide sequences of ESR beta showed a very complex repeat pattern in apes. The human sequences had a non-variable preceding sequence at (CA),, (GA)(2)(TA)(8)(CA)(4)(TA). In apes that region included {(TA)(n)(CA)(n)}(n). Gibbon sequences included (TATG)(n) and (TATC)(n) and no regular construction was observed. A deletion event in the reverse primer site seems to have occurred in the orangutan lineage. In addition, a great diversity of allele length was detected in each gibbon species."

Only eight DNA alleles and three proteins of this gene have been described and their frequencies analyzed in Caucasian, Oriental, Asian Indian, and Negroid populations. In the present study, HLA-E polymorphism has been analyzed in six Amerindian and Mestizo populations from North and South America and compared with previously described populations. HLA-E*0101 is the most frequent allele found in all populations except in Afrocolombian and Wayu Amerindians, in which blood group analyses show a high admixture with Caucasian and African populations. Mazatecan and Mapuche (two Amerindian groups from North and South America, respectively) presented similar HLA-E frequencies, whereas Wayu Indians are more similar to the Afrocolombian population. The Mexican and Colombian Mestizo show similar allele frequencies to Amerindians with high frequencies of HLA-E*0101 and HLA-E*010302 alleles. Also, frequencies in Negroids and Asian Indians present a similar distribution of HLA-E alleles. These data are in agreement with worldwide restricted polymorphism of HLA-E because no new allele was detected in the six populations studied. The allelic frequencies show differences among Caucasian, Oriental, Mestizo and Indian populations. Ape major histocompatibility complex-E allelism is also very restricted: common chimpanzee (one allele); bonobo (two alleles); gorilla (two alleles); orangutan (one allele); rhesus monkey (eight alleles); cynomolgus monkey (two alleles); and green monkey (two alleles)."
MHC-F polymorphism and evolution,"['Moscoso, J', 'Serrano-Vela, JI', 'Arnaiz-Villena, A']",TISSUE ANTIGENS,10.1111/j.1399-0039.2006.763_3.x,APR 2007,3,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-F class Ib locus shows a limited polymorphism, and the function of its mainly intracellular protein is not clear. We have identified human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-F orthologous DNA sequences in Pongidae in order to study the MHC-F gene evolution and its products' function. HLA-F orthologous complementary DNA transcripts are found in chimpanzee and in the new primate species studied (bonobo, gorilla and orangutan). Analyses of the predicted amino acid sequences and their comparison with other primate MHC-F proteins show that MHC-F may be a protein with a typical class I structure and that the key residues of the peptide-binding region are highly conserved in MHC-F in all studied primates species. Thus, MHC-F conservation along the primate evolution suggests an important role in cellular physiology. It is possible that the MHC-F protein could be involved, together with MHC-G and MHC-E, in the natural killer cell activity regulation, although rhesus macaque cannot express complete surface MHC-G orthologue molecules."

Group size: Determinants in the wild and implications for the captive housing of wild mammals in zoos,"['Price, EE', 'Stoinski, TS']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2006.05.021,MAR 20 2007,13,"Group size is one of the most important factors influencing the formation and maintenance of successful social groups in captivity. For zoos, appropriate social groupings are of the utmost importance to provide examples of species-typical behaviors, as well as attain captive breeding goals. In the wild, group-living evolved largely in response to the need for predator avoidance and territory defense. The number of members in wild groups is a fundamental determinant of individual fitness, affecting net food intake and reproductive success. Captive animals encounter different environmental pressures than their wild counterparts; food availability and predation are no longer concerns, however they still face competition for mates and are unable to make the social adjustments necessary to decrease social tension. As such, group size has a large impact on the behavior, welfare and reproductive success of captive animals. Depending on the species, suboptimal sizes can be associated with increased abnormal behaviors and decreased reproductive success and infant survival in a range of captive mammals. However, in the absence of environmental constraints, many species can be housed in a greater diversity of social groups than observed in the wild. Thus, a key component of captive housing is flexibility. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Evolutionary genomic remodelling of the human 4q subtelomere (4q35.2),"['Bodega, B', 'Cardone, MF', 'Muller, S', 'Neusser, M', 'Orzan, F', 'Rossi, E', 'Battaglioli, E', 'Marozzi, A', 'Riva, P', 'Rocchi, M', 'Meneveri, R', 'Ginelli, E']",BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1186/1471-2148-7-39,MAR 14 2007,8,"Background: In order to obtain insights into the functionality of the human 4q35.2 domain harbouring the facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) locus, we investigated in African apes genomic and chromatin organisations, and the nuclear topology of orthologous regions.

Results: A basic block consisting of short D4Z4 arrays (10-15 repeats), 4q35.2 specific sequences, and approximately 35 kb of interspersed repeats from different LINE subfamilies was repeated at least twice in the gorilla 4qter. This genomic organisation has undergone evolutionary remodelling, leading to the single representation of both the D4Z4 array and LINE block in chimpanzee, and the loss of the LINE block in humans. The genomic remodelling has had an impact on 4qter chromatin organisation, but not its interphase nuclear topology. In comparison with humans, African apes show very low or undetectable levels of FRG1 and FRG2 histone 4 acetylation and gene transcription, although histone deacetylase inhibition restores gene transcription to levels comparable with those of human cells, thus indicating that the 4qter region is capable of acquiring a more open chromatin structure. Conversely, as in humans, the 4qter region in African apes has a very peripheral nuclear localisation.

Conclusion: The 4q subtelomere has undergone substantial genomic changes during evolution that have had an impact on chromatin condensation and the region's transcriptional regulation. Consequently, the 4qter genes in African apes and humans seem to be subjected to a different strategy of regulation in which LINE and D4Z4 sequences may play a pivotal role. However, the effect of peripheral nuclear anchoring of 4qter on these regulation mechanisms is still unclear. The observed differences in the regulation of 4qter gene expression between African apes and humans suggest that the human 4q35.2 locus has acquired a novel functional relevance."
Pair of lice lost or parasites regained: the evolutionary history of anthropoid primate lice,"['Reed, DL', 'Light, JE', 'Allen, JM', 'Kirchman, JJ']",BMC BIOLOGY,10.1186/1741-7007-5-7,MAR 7 2007,44,"Background: The parasitic sucking lice of primates are known to have undergone at least 25 million years of coevolution with their hosts. For example, chimpanzee lice and human head/body lice last shared a common ancestor roughly six million years ago, a divergence that is contemporaneous with their hosts. In an assemblage where lice are often highly host specific, humans host two different genera of lice, one that is shared with chimpanzees and another that is shared with gorillas. In this study, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of primate lice and infer the historical events that explain the current distribution of these lice on their primate hosts.

Results: Phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analyses suggest that the louse genera Pediculus and Pthirus are each monophyletic, and are sister taxa to one another. The age of the most recent common ancestor of the two Pediculus species studied matches the age predicted by host divergence ( ca. 6 million years), whereas the age of the ancestor of Pthirus does not. The two species of Pthirus ( Pthirus gorillae and Pthirus pubis) last shared a common ancestor ca. 3-4 million years ago, which is considerably younger than the divergence between their hosts ( gorillas and humans, respectively), of approximately 7 million years ago.

Conclusion: Reconciliation analysis determines that there are two alternative explanations that account for the current distribution of anthropoid primate lice. The more parsimonious of the two solutions suggests that a Pthirus species switched from gorillas to humans. This analysis assumes that the divergence between Pediculus and Pthirus was contemporaneous with the split ( i.e., a node of cospeciation) between gorillas and the lineage leading to chimpanzees and humans. Divergence date estimates, however, show that the nodes in the host and parasite trees are not contemporaneous. Rather, the shared coevolutionary history of the anthropoid primates and their lice contains a mixture of evolutionary events including cospeciation, parasite duplication, parasite extinction, and host switching. Based on these data, the coevolutionary history of primates and their lice has been anything but parsimonious."
"Understanding visual access in common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus: perspective taking or behaviour reading?","['Burkart, JM', 'Heschl, A']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.05.019,MAR 2007,31,"We tested common marmosets' understanding of visual access in a series of experiments. In experiment 1, we investigated whether marmosets know what conspecifics do and do not see, using a food competition paradigm originally developed for chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes. Subordinate marmosets consistently chose a piece of food only visible to them and not one that was visible to a dominant competitor as well, indicating a simple mentalistic understanding of visual access (level-1 perspective taking). In experiment 2, we aimed to validate these results by using a different experimental approach, building on the marmosets' ability to use gaze as a cue. Although the marmosets precisely extrapolated gaze direction, no understanding of visual access could be found in this task. In experiment 3, we tested an alternative mechanism to account for the positive outcome in experiment 1. The results suggested that the marmosets had a predisposition to treat a piece of food that was looked at by another individual as belonging to that individual and to avoid it. The marmosets overall showed high proficiency in exactly extrapolating gaze direction but failed to show consistent and context-independent perspective-taking abilities. The findings are discussed with regard to results from other primate species and, from a broader evolutionary perspective, with regard to their implications for the emergence of sophisticated forms of gaze understanding in humans.

Mental rotation of anthropoid hands: a chronometric study,"['Gawryszewski, LG', 'Silva-dos-Santos, CF', 'Santos-Silva, JC', 'Lameira, AP', 'Pereira, A']",BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH,10.1590/S0100-879X2007000300013,MAR 2007,6,"It has been shown that mental rotation of objects and human body parts is processed differently in the human brain. But what about body parts belonging to other primates? Does our brain process this information like any other object or does it instead maximize the structural similarities with our homologous body parts? We tried to answer this question by measuring the manual reaction time (MRT) of human participants discriminating the handedness of drawings representing the hands of four anthropoid primates (orangutan, chimpanzee, gorilla, and human). Twenty-four right-handed volunteers (13 males and 11 females) were instructed to judge the handedness of a hand drawing in palm view by pressing a left/right key. The orientation of hand drawings varied from 0 degrees (fingers upwards) to 90 degrees lateral (fingers pointing away from the midline), 180 degrees (fingers downwards) and 90 degrees medial (finger towards the midline). The results showed an effect of rotation angle (F(3, 69) = 19.57, P < 0.001), but not of hand identity, on MRTs. Moreover, for all hand drawings, a medial rotation elicited shorter MRTs than a lateral rotation (960 and 1169 ms, respectively, P < 0.05). This result has been previously observed for drawings of the human hand and related to biomechanical constraints of movement performance. Our findings indicate that anthropoid hands are essentially equivalent stimuli for handedness recognition. Since the task involves mentally simulating the posture and rotation of the hands, we wondered if ""mirror neurons"" could be involved in establishing the motor equivalence between the stimuli and the participants' own hands."
The 800-lb gorilla we all ignore: treatment of NSCLC in elderly and PS 2 patients.,"['Devlin, John G', 'Langer, Corey J']",Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,NA,2007-Mar,4,"Patients with non-small cell lung cancer,NSCLC, typically have advanced disease on presentation. First-line palliative platinum-based doublet chemotherapy has emerged as the standard of care in fit, younger patients. However, patients with advanced age and/or impaired performance status have been relatively underrepresented in clinical trials. Retrospective analyses and the few existing prospective randomized trials in these populations have suggested a poorer overall prognosis, yet also provide evidence of benefit from systemic therapy. Toxicity is generally manageable, and in most cases, comparable to that of younger, healthier patients. There are clearly expanding roles for nonplatinum chemotherapy agents and newer targeted therapies, which have generally yielded decreased toxicity compared to platinum-based chemotherapy without sacrificing efficacy. Appropriate pretreatment assessment and proper patient selection is of paramount importance; it is imperative to treat patients who are most likely to garner benefit. In summary, data suggest that these relatively neglected populations of NSCLC patients can be safely treated, and can benefit from palliative systemic therapy. Single-agent chemotherapy is generally recommended over combination chemotherapy, although investigation of newer targeted therapies or alternative agents may allow for combination therapy in the near future. Further prospective investigation is absolutely warranted."
Ethical and legal aspects of animal experiments on non-human primates,"['Luy, J']",DEUTSCHE TIERARZTLICHE WOCHENSCHRIFT,10.2377/0341-6593-114-81,MAR 2007,3,"Animal experiments on non-human primates give cause for ethical concerns for three reasons (1) the inclusion of,ethical animal protection"" in the German Constitution (Article 20a of the Grundgesetz"" GG, 2002) has led to real consequences for the application process with respect to the use of primates for fundamental research; (2) the legal requirements in Europe to ensure animal welfare are currently being tightened and (3) the global problem of the protection of species, especially with respect to the capturing and subsequent sale of primates is still unsolved. As a result of the way humans interpret the term justice (the principle of equality) it was to be expected that great apes, being the animals that most closely resemble humans, would play a key role in the establishment of animal protection laws. In 1997, Great Britain and Ireland made it illegal to conduct experiments on great apes. In 1999, New Zealand went even further and created a kind of basic rights for great apes. In 2003, The Netherlands forbade animal experiments using great apes as did Sweden, which also included gibbons in this ban (which is in line with current taxonomy, which considers gibbons to belong to the family Hominidae). In 2006 Austria forbade experiments carried out on chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orang-utans, and gibbons. Only recently, a state commission on ethics in Switzerland demanded that the Swiss government do the same. And the summer of 2006 saw a debate in Spain on the inclusion of the protection of great apes in the primary goals of the state. Due to the principle of equality, a further extension (both geographically and systemically) of the exclusion of great apes from animal experiments is to be expected. Since Article 20a GG on ethical animal protection"" came into effect on August 1, 2002, the regulatory authorities in Germany have the right to independently check and control animal experiments as to their ethical tenability (Administrative Court Giessen, confirmed by the Administrative Court of the State of Hessia) i.e. an authorization for experiments in the area of fundamental research may only be given by the authorities if the,,ethical tenability"" (according to Section 7 paragraph 3 of the German Law on Animal Welfare) is given. The ethical tenability"" of fundamental research experiments follows other rules than those that pertain to applied research. Fundamental research is granted a low to mid-level tolerance of pain and suffering as being ethically tenable; not tenable are stronger or very high doses of pain and suffering. Actually in summer 2006, a proposal for fundamental research using monkeys was not approved on recommendation of the Commission on Animal Welfare because it was considered to be ethically untenable."""
Maternal investment of the virunga mountain gorillas,"['Robbins, AM', 'Robbins, MM', 'Fawcett, K']",ETHOLOGY,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01319.x,MAR 2007,8,"The Trivers & Willard hypothesis (TWH) predicts that females with more resources should bias their maternal investment toward offspring of the sex that is most likely to benefit from those additional resources. This paper examines the sex allocation of 61 female mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) of the Virunga volcanoes, Rwanda from 1967 to 2004. Like most highly dimorphic, polygynous mammals, mountain gorillas are expected to show greater variance in reproductive success among males than females, so mothers in good condition should bias their investment toward sons. Using dominance rank as the indicator of maternal condition, the TWH was tentatively supported by our results with interbirth intervals (IBI). Dominant mothers had longer IBI following the birth of sons, relative to the longer IBI that subordinate mothers had with daughters. In contrast, maternal condition did not have a significant effect on birth sex ratios. We also found no significant relationships with other variables that might influence birth sex ratios (e.g., maternal age, parity, or group size), and the overall birth sex ratio was not significantly different from a 50:50 split. Collectively, our results suggest that female mountain gorillas do not control the sex ratio of their offspring at birth, but they may adjust their subsequent maternal investment. This conclusion is consistent with recurring questions about whether any adjustments in birth sex ratios occur in primates."
The short legs of great apes: Evidence for aggressive behavior in australopiths,"['Carrier, DR']",EVOLUTION,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00061.x,MAR 2007,11,"Early hominins, australopiths, were similar to most large primates in having relatively short hindlimbs for their body size. The short legs of large primates are thought to represent specialization for vertical climbing and quadrupedal stability on branches. Although this may be true, there are reasons to suspect that the evolution of short legs may also represent specialization for physical aggression. Fighting in apes is a behavior in which short legs are expected to improve performance by lowering the center of mass during bipedal stance and by increasing the leverage through which muscle forces can be applied to the ground. Among anthropoid primates, body size sexual dimorphism (SSD) and canine height sexual dimorphism (CSD) are strongly correlated with levels of male-male competition, allowing SSD and CSD to be used as indices of male-male aggression. Here I show that the evolution of hindlimb length in apes is inversely correlated with the evolution of SSD (R-2 = 0.683, P-value = 0.006) and the evolution of CSD (R-2 = 0.630, P-value = 0.013). In contrast, a significant correlation was not observed for the relationship between the evolution of hindlimb and forelimb lengths. These observations are consistent with the suggestion that selection for fighting performance has maintained relatively short hindlimbs in species of Hominoidea with high levels of male-male competition. Although australopiths were highly derived for striding bipedalism when traveling on the ground, they retained short legs compared to those of Homo for over two million years, approximately 100,000 generations. Their short legs may be indicative of persistent selection for high"
New aspects of chromosomal evolution in the gorilla and the orangutan,"['Weise, A', 'Gross, M', 'Schmidt, S', 'Reichelt, F', 'Claussen, U', 'Liehr, T']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE,NA,MAR 2007,3,"It is well-accepted that studies of chromosomal changes which have occurred during the evolution of the great apes and the human provide clues towards the phylogeny of these species. Applying recently developed molecular cytogenetic approaches, this study on the chromosomes of the orangutan and the gorilla revealed the presence of cryptic, until now, unrecognized cytogenetic rearrangements mainly within the evolutionary dynamic subcentromeric and subtelomeric regions. On four orangutan chromosomes new rearrangements were detected such as a pericentric inversion in Pongo pygmaeus abeli (PPya) #1, complex rearrangements on #2 of Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus (PPYP) and PPYa and a subtelomeric deletion on PPYa&p #19. Additionally, the first centromere repositioning in the great apes was detected on PPYa&p #8. Moreover, the breakpoints of four pericentric inversions within the two orangutan subspecies and three pericentric inversions on Gorilla beringei beringei (GBEb) chromosomes #3, #11 and #13 were refined.

Why are some species more commonly afflicted by arthritis than others? A comparative study of spondyloarthropathy in primates and carnivores,"['Nunn, CL', 'Rothschild, B', 'Gittleman, JL']",JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2006.01276.x,MAR 2007,8,"Spondyloarthropathy is a painful arthritic affliction of humans that also occurs in wild mammals. Important questions remain concerning the underlying causes of spondyloarthropathy in mammals, particularly regarding whether it is infectious in origin or driven by genetic predisposition and environmental stressors. Moreover, spondyloarthropathy has negative effects on host fitness, leading to potential conservation concerns if it impacts threatened species. Using a comparative data set on the prevalence of joint disease in 34 primate species and 100 carnivore species, we tested predictions involving the epidemiological correlates of spondyloarthropathy in wild mammals. Analyses revealed that 5.6% of primates and 3.6% of carnivores exhibited signs of spondyloarthropathy, with maximum incidence as high as 22% in great apes and 27% in bears. We tested whether prevalence of spondyloarthropathy increases with population density and group size, greater contact with soil, a slower host life history, increased ranging, dietary factors and body mass. We found general support for an effect of body mass, with larger bodied primates and carnivores exhibiting a higher prevalence of spondyloarthropathy. In addition, more threatened species experienced higher rates of spondyloarthropathy, with this association influenced by body mass and phylogeny. The effect of body mass could reflect that larger animals are exposed to more pathogens through greater consumption of resources, or that joints of larger bodied mammals experience greater biomechanical stresses, resulting in inflammation and activation of local joint infections."
The orang-utan mating system and the unflanged male: A product of increased food stress during the late Miocene and Pliocene?,"['Harrison, ME', 'Chivers, DJ']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.09.005,MAR 2007,16,"The orang-utan is unique among apes in having an unusually long male developmental period and two distinct adult male morphs (flanged and unflanged), which generally, but not exclusively, employ different reproductive strategies (call-and-wait vs. sneak-and-rape). Both morphs have recently been shown to have roughly similar levels of reproductive success in the one site where such a study has been conducted. This is in stark contrast to the unimale polygynous gorilla, in which dominant males sire almost all infants. Despite this, evidence on sexual dimorphism, life history, diet, and socioecology of extant and extinct apes, as well as the ontogeny, reproductive morphology, and physiology of extant apes, all indicate that the orang-utan's present-day mating system most likely evolved from a gorilla-like base, with one dominant male guarding a harem of females. The available evidence indicates that, due chiefly to the likely onset of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (generally regarded as the trigger for mast fruiting in dipterocarps) approximately 3-5 Ma, southeast Asian forests would have began to experience longer and more severe periods of low food availability. This change in food availability would have meant that full-time gregariousness was no longer energetically tolerable and, as a result, females dispersed more widely in search of food and adult/flanged males were no longer able to effectively guard a harem of females. A niche for a quiet, quick, opportunistic ""sexual predator"" (i.e., the unflanged male) then became available. This finding implies that, despite being anatomically quite chimpanzee-like, the ancestral hominoid probably had a social and mating system more similar to the gorilla than any other living ape.

Reliance on head versus eyes in the gaze following of great apes and human infants: the cooperative eye hypothesis,"['Tomasello, M', 'Hare, B', 'Lehmann, H', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevo1.2006.10.001,MAR 2007,92,"As compared with other primates, humans have especially visible eyes (e.g., white sclera). One hypothesis is that this feature of human eyes evolved to make it easier for conspecifics to follow an individual's gaze direction in close-range joint attentional and communicative interactions, which would seem to imply especially cooperative (mututalistic) conspecifics. In the current study, we tested one aspect of this cooperative eye hypothesis by comparing the gaze following behavior of great apes to that of human infants. A human experimenter ""looked"" to the ceiling either with his eyes only, head only (eyes closed), both head and eyes, or neither. Great apes followed gaze to the ceiling based mainly on the human's head direction (although eye direction played some role as well). In contrast, human infants relied almost exclusively on eye direction in these same situations. These results demonstrate that humans are especially reliant on eyes in gaze following situations, and thus, suggest that eyes evolved a new social function in human evolution, most likely to support cooperative (mututalistic) social interactions.

Significant differences exist between captive and wild animals for total white blood cell count, segmented neutrophil count, band neutrophil count, eosinophil count, monocyte count, and basophil count, and for serum biochemistry values of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, serum alkaline phosphatase, total protein, creatinine, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, potassium, and creatine phosphokinase. One animal had a positive Toxoplasma titer. Detected endoparasites were identified as Lemuricolo and Callistroura. Two ectoparasite mites were identified, one within the Psoroptes genus and one within the Laelapidae family. Enteric bacterial flora included Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Klebsiella ozaenae and Bacillus cercus."
The evolutionary history of human and chimpanzee Y-chromosome gene loss,"['Perry, GH', 'Tito, RY', 'Verrelli, BC']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msm002,MAR 2007,14,"Recent studies have suggested that gene gain and loss may contribute significantly to the divergence between humans and chimpanzees. Initial comparisons of the human and chimpanzee Y-chromosomes indicate that chimpanzees have a disproportionate loss of Y-chromosome genes, which may have implications for the adaptive evolution of sex-specific as well as reproductive traits, especially because one of the genes lost in chimpanzees is critically involved in spermatogenesis in humans. Here we have characterized Y-chromosome sequences in gorilla, bonobo, and several chimpanzee subspecies for 7 chimpanzee gene-disruptive mutations. Our analyses show that 6 of these gene-disruptive mutations predate chimpanzee-bonobo divergence at similar to 1.8 MYA, which indicates significant Y-chromosome change in the chimpanzee lineage relatively early in the evolutionary divergence of humans and chimpanzees."

Assessment of reproductive behavior and hormonal cycles in geriatric western lowland gorillas,"['Margulis, SW', 'Atsalis, S', 'Bellem, A', 'Wielebnowski, N', 'MENOPAUSE']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20124,MAR-APR 2007,10,"The population of western lowland gorillas in North American zoos is aging and, as is the case with the aging human population, may have unique physical and social needs. We have documented previously that 25% of aging females (5/22) ceased to show reproductive cycles entirely, and could be defined as menopausal. Approximately 32% of females showed somewhat irregular cycling patterns. We review our hormonal and behavioral findings on reproductive aging in gorillas; describe the range of cycling patterns that we see and how we interpret these; and discuss the implications of these findings for captive management and husbandry of aging gorillas. We monitored fecal hormone metabolites (progestogens) in 30 gorillas and collected simultaneous behavioral data to evaluate the relationship between cyclicity and sexual behavior. We identified and described several discrete patterns of irregular cycling. These included extreme variability of cycle length, cyclic patterns with unusually low progestogen peak concentrations that possibly may not support luteal activity, and large variability in maximum progestogen peak height among cycles. All of these changes are consistent with age-related hormonal changes observed in humans and may be signs of changes in fertility as well. Behaviorally, nearly all cycling females exhibited signs of estrus. Affiliative behavior between male silverbacks and estrous females was observed in the control females, but not the geriatric females. These findings suggest that premenopausal females are exhibiting signs of perimenopause. As is the case in humans, such changes in hormone patterns may occur years before the onset of menopause. As enhancements in nutrition, husbandry, and veterinary medicine have led to increased longevity in our zoo populations of apes, it has become imperative that we investigate and better understand associated physiological and behavioral changes in geriatric animals to ensure appropriate management of this increasing demographic sub-population."
"Genomic relationships and speciation times of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla inferred from a coalescent hidden Markov model","['Hobolth, A', 'Christensen, OF', 'Mailund, T', 'Schierup, MH']",PLOS GENETICS,10.1371/journal.pgen.0030007,FEB 2007,146,"The genealogical relationship of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla varies along the genome. We develop a hidden Markov model (HMM) that incorporates this variation and relate the model parameters to population genetics quantities such as speciation times and ancestral population sizes. Our HMM is an analytically tractable approximation to the coalescent process with recombination, and in simulations we see no apparent bias in the HMM estimates. We apply the HMM to four autosomal contiguous human-chimp-gorilla-orangutan alignments comprising a total of 1.9 million base pairs. We find a very recent speciation time of human-chimp (4.1 +/- 0.4 million years), and fairly large ancestral effective population sizes (65,000 6 30,000 for the human-chimp ancestor and 45,000 6 10,000 for the human-chimp-gorilla ancestor). Furthermore, around 50% of the human genome coalesces with chimpanzee after speciation with gorilla. We also consider 250,000 base pairs of X-chromosome alignments and find an effective population size much smaller than 75% of the autosomal effective population sizes. Finally, we find that the rate of transitions between different genealogies correlates well with the region-wide present-day human recombination rate, but does not correlate with the fine-scale recombination rates and recombination hot spots, suggesting that the latter are evolutionarily transient."

We review the topographical features and causal factors of stereotyped and self-injurious behavior in captive nonhuman primates, and the small number of published studies that have used operant conditioning to address these behavioral problems. The techniques developed in treating human stereotyped and self-injurious behavior are then described, and comparisons are made between the two approaches. Virtually all the techniques found to be effective treatments of stereotypy and self-injurious behavior in humans are directly applicable to similar behaviors in captive nonhuman primates. Thus the human work can serve as a model for how we can enhance our attempts to address behavioral problems in captive nonhuman primates. We advocate a philosophy of behavioral management, based partly on the science of behavior analysis, that includes a systematic, scientific approach to the discovery and description of behavioral problems and their treatment.

The shape of the hominoid proximal femur: a geometric morphometric analysis,"['Harmon, EH', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2006.00688.x,FEB 2007,24,"As part of the hip joint, the proximal femur is an integral locomotor component. Although a link between locomotion and the morphology of some aspects of the proximal femur has been identified, inclusive shapes of this element have not been compared among behaviourally heterogeneous hominoids. Previous analyses have partitioned complex proximal femoral morphology into discrete features (e.g. head, neck, greater trochanter) to facilitate conventional linear measurements. In this study, three-dimensional geometric morphometrics are used to examine the shape of the proximal femur in hominoids to determine whether femoral shape co-varies with locomotor category. Fourteen landmarks are recorded on adult femora of Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo and Hylobates. Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) is used to adjust for position, orientation and scale among landmark configurations. Principal components analysis is used to collapse and compare variation in residuals from GPA, and thin-plate spline analysis is used to visualize shape change among taxa. The results indicate that knucklewalking African apes are similar to one another in femoral shape, whereas the more suspensory Asian apes diverge from the African ape pattern. The shape of the human and orangutan proximal femur converge, a result that is best explained in terms of the distinct requirements for locomotion in each group. These findings suggest that the shape of the proximal femur is brought about primarily by locomotor behaviour."

Summation accuracy and RNJ were similar to those of previous reports in apes; however, the pattern of age-related differences with regard to these tasks was different from that previously reported in gorillas. Older orangutans were less accurate than the young and middle-aged for RNJ, and summation accuracy was equivalent among age groups. Evidence was found to suggest that the young and middle-aged based their selection of the largest quantity pair on both quantities within each pair during the summation task. These results show a relationship between subject age and the quantitative abilities of adult orangutans."
Army ant prey availability and consumption by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes vellerosus) at Gashaka (Nigeria),"['Schoning, C', 'Ellis, D', 'Fowler, A', 'Sommer, V']",JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00177.x,FEB 2007,29,"Army ant predation by chimpanzees has been studied as an intriguing example of tool use and a possible case of cultural variation. However, the importance of army ant prey in chimpanzee diet and feeding ecology is still only poorly understood. We studied the availability and consumption of army ants in a population of the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes vellerosus in Nigeria. Army ants were collected from nests and trails (workers) and near artificial light sources (males). Three potential prey species were found: Dorylus rufescens, Dorylus gerstaeckeri and Dorylus kohli. Dorylus rufescens was by far more abundant than the other two species. Only remains from D. rufescens were present in chimpanzee faeces. This is the first report of consumption of this ant species by chimpanzees. However, because of the low availability of the other two species, it is unclear whether this pattern reflects a preference for D. rufescens. Although D. rufescens' availability varied with weather conditions, the occurrence as well as the absolute and relative numbers of Dorylus fragments in faeces did not. This finding, together with the considerable difficulties encountered by human observers in their efforts to locate nests by following trails, suggests that the chimpanzees in this population do not harvest army ants from trails and do not use trails to locate nests. The overall occurrence of army ant fragments in 42.3% of all faecal samples is the highest ever recorded in any chimpanzee population. This indicates that in this chimpanzee population, army ant prey is not a fallback during periods of sparse availability of plant food, but quantitatively important throughout the year. Future studies will be needed to clarify which cues and strategies chimpanzees use to locate army ant nests and to assess the role of myrmecophagy with respect to macro- or micronutrient demands."

Because of its secretive behaviour and main habitat (dense rainforests), there is little quantitative information on the habitat preferences of this buffalo. We present here the first data on the frequencies of this species along a habitat gradient ranging from clearings and rivers to forests, as well as the characteristics of the buffalo's resting places. We recorded information from a buffalo herd during the period January 2002-January 2004 in the Bai-Hokou area (Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African Republic). Resting places were firstly compared with available habitat (i.e. resting vs. random sites) and, successively, comparisons were made between diurnal versus nocturnal and wet versus dry season resting places. Forest buffalos were found to be highly dependent on clearings, as well as on the more open forest stands, characterized by large trees and open canopy. Such preferences could be due to the tendency of the buffalos to rest all together; open patches are likely to facilitate social interactions between the members of the herd."
Disulfide-bond reshuffling in the evolution of an ape placental ribonuclease,"['Zhang, JZ']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msl177,FEB 2007,8,"Disulfide bonds play important roles in the folding and stability of proteins and are evolutionarily conserved. A classic example is RNase A (also known as bovine pancreatic ribonuclease), which contains 4 conserved disulfide bonds among 8 cysteines. However, human RNase 8, a paralog of RNase A uniquely expressed in the placenta, has lost one of the conserved cysteines but gained another, when compared with RNase 8 of various monkeys and with RNase A. We here show that both the loss and gain of the cysteines in human RNase 8 occurred in the common ancestor of African great apes (humans, chimps, and gorillas) 7-13 MYA. Computational predictions suggest changes of disulfide bonding by these cysteine substitutions. Site-directed mutagenesis indicates that if the ribonucleolytic activity is essential for RNase 8's function, the gain of the cysteine must have preceded the loss. Human RNase 8 represents one of the first examples in which the presumable evolutionary change of a disulfide bond involves 1 loss and 1 gain of cysteine, instead of 2 losses or 2 gains. Our results provide the foundation for detailed analysis toward understanding the impact of disulfide-bond reshuffling on the structure, function, and evolution of proteins in general and human RNase 8 in particular."
Genetic analysis reveals population structure and recent migration within the highly fragmented range of the Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli),"['Bergl, RA', 'Vigilant, L']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03159.x,FEB 2007,88,"Recently developed methods of individual-based analysis of genetic data allow an unprecedented opportunity to understand the relationships among fragmented populations. By defining population structure and identifying migrant individuals, such analyses can provide a framework to aid in evaluating the threats posed by inbreeding and reduced genetic variability as a consequence of limited gene flow among fragments. Here we investigate population structure in the critically endangered Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli) by applying a suite of individual-based analyses to data obtained from between one-quarter and one-third of the estimated total population through the use of noninvasively collected DNA samples. The population structure inferred using data from 11 autosomal microsatellite loci was broadly consistent with geography and habitat fragmentation, but showed no simple isolation-by-distance effects. In contrast to previous field surveys, which suggested that all gorilla localities were isolated from one another, we infer low levels of gene flow and identify migrants between habitat fragments as well as individuals of admixed ancestry, suggesting persistent recent reproductive contact between many of the localities. These results are encouraging for the conservation of the Cross River gorilla population. Conservation efforts should strive to maintain connectivity between subpopulations that are still in migratory contact and attempt to restore connectivity where it has been lost."
Variant abductor pollicis longus muscle: a case report.,"['Paul, Shipra', 'Das, Srijit']","Acta medica (Hradec Kralove) / Universitas Carolina, Facultas Medica Hradec Kralove",NA,2007,4,"Abductor pollicis longus (APL) muscle is known to exhibit different variations with respect to its attachments. Various studies have reported the splitting of the APL muscle. Comparative anatomical findings of split insertion of APL is commonly found in chimpanzees, gorillas and gibbons. In the present study, we describe an anomalous APL muscle, which originated from the posterior surface of the shaft of the radius and ulna and traversed a course deep to the extensor retinaculum. Interestingly, immediately after emerging form the deeper aspect of extensor retinaculum, the thin tendon of the APL muscle continued again as a muscular belly in relation to the dorsolateral part of the 1st metacarpal bone, to end as a tendon with its attachment to the base of the proximal phalanx. Such an unusual variation of APL with its attachment into proximal phalanx is a rare finding and may be of importance in altering the mechanics of the thumb during abduction. The clinical significance of such an anatomical variation of APL may be important during reconstructive surgeries involving thumb and also of academic interest."
"Fighting boys, strong men and gorillas: Notes on the imagination of masculinities in Kinshasa","['Pype, K']",AFRICA,10.3366/afr.2007.77.2.250,2007,10,"The article provides insight into the current violent practices of urban youngsters in Kinshasa. At nightfall youth gangs transform the streets of Kinshasa's townships into arenas of the fight. Frequent regular clashes between these gangs create young violent leaders, who not only sow terror but also provide security for the inhabitants (young and old) of their territories. Although many of these boys and young men are trained in foreign fighting styles such as judo, jujitsu and karate, in the public clashes between the fighting groups, these boys and young men perform mukumbusu. This fighting style, inspired and based on the gorilla, was invented during the last decade of colonialism, and is an original mixture of a traditional Mongo wrestling practice, libanda, and Asian and Western fighting practices. In the article, I scrutinize the practices of these young fighters through the diverse images of masculinity (kimobali) upon which they draw, such as the fighter and the soldier; and the models of masculinity that they contest, the sapeur and the staffeur."

We demonstrate how they have been used to help resolve a number of questions in primate phylogeny, including the human-chimpanzee-gorilla trichotomy and New World primate phylogeny. Alu and LINE1 element insertion polymorphisms have also been analyzed in human populations to test hypotheses about human evolution and population affinities and to address forensic issues.

We review how they have influenced fundamental ongoing processes like nonhomologous recombination, genomic deletion, and X chromosome inactivation. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
"Variations of the mandibular shape in extant hominoids: Generic, specific, and subspecific quantification using elliptical Fourier analysis in lateral view","['Schmittbuhl, M', 'Rieger, J', 'Le Minor, JM', 'Schaaf, A', 'Guy, F']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20476,JAN 2007,14,"While a number of studies have documented the mandibular variations in hominoids, few focused on evaluating the variation of the whole outline of this structure. Using an efficient morphometrical approach, i.e. elliptical Fourier analysis, mandibular outlines in lateral view from 578 adult hominoids representing the genera Hylobates, Pongo, Gorilla, Pan, and Homo were quantified and compared. This study confirms that elliptical Fourier analysis provides an accurate characterization of the shape of the mandibular profile. Differences in mandibular shape between hominoid genera, species, subspecies, and to a lesser extent between sexes were demonstrated. Mandibles in great apes and hylobatids subspecies were generally less distinct from each other than were species. However, the magnitudes of differences among subspecies of Gorilla and Pongo approached or exceeded those between Pan troglodytes and P. paniscus. The powerful discrimination between taxa from the genus down to subspecific level associated to the relatively low level of intrageneric mandibular polymorphism in great apes provides strong evidences in support of the taxonomic utility of the shape of the mandibular profile in hominoids. In addition, morphological affinities between Pongo and Pan and the clear distinction between Homo and Pan suggest that the mandibular outline is a poor estimate of phylogenetic relationships in great apes and humans. The sexual dimorphism in mandibular shape exhibits two patterns of expression: a high degree of dimorphism in Gorilla, Pongo, and H. s. syndactylus and a relatively low one in modern humans and Pan. Besides, degree of mandibular shape dimorphism can vary considerably among closely related subspecies as observed in gorillas, arguing against the use of mandibular shape dimorphism patterns as characters in phylogenetic analyses. However, the quantification of the mandibular shape and of the variations among hominoids provides an interesting comparative framework that is likely to supply further arguments for a better understanding of the patterns of differentiation between living hominoids."

The unique functions of this hormone are provided by the FSH receptor-binding beta-subunit encoded by the FSHB gene. Resequencing and genotyping of FSHB in three European, two Asian and one African population, as well as in the great apes (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan), revealed low diversity and significant excess of polymorphisms with intermediate frequency alleles. Statistical tests for FSHB showed deviations from neutrality in all populations suggesting a possible effect of balancing selection. Two core haplotypes were identified (carried by 76-96.6% of each population's sample), the sequences of which are clearly separated from each other. As fertility most directly affects an organism's fitness, the carriers of these haplotypes have apparently had more success in human history to contribute to the next generation. There is a preliminary observation suggesting that the second most frequent FSHB haplotype may be associated with rapid conception success in females. Interestingly, the same haplotype is related to an ancestral FSHB variant shared with the ancestor of the great apes. The determination of the functional consequence of the two core FSHB variants may have implications for understanding and regulating human fertility, as well as in assisting infertility treatments."

Relationship of bone utilization and biomechanical competence in hominoid mandibles,"['Daegling, DJ']",ARCHIVES OF ORAL BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.archoralbio.2006.07.002,JAN 2007,20,"This investigation explores regional variation in bone mass in the mandibles of large-bodied hominoids with respect to the masticatory biomechanical environment. Cortical area, subperiosteal area, mandibular length, maximum and minimum area moments of inertia are sampled at 7 sections along the mandibular corpus in 20 specimens each of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus and Gorilla gorilla. The null hypothesis is that bone is utilized similarly among species, between sexes and among corpus locations in terms of economy of bone deployment (relative to subperiosteal area) and efficiency in producing structural stiffness (relative to cross-sectional moments of inertia). The alternative hypothesis is that dietary toughness and the scaling of muscular force recruitment produces an unfavourable stress environment in the mandible such that larger species (Gorilla and Pongo) use relatively more cortical bone than Pan and Homo.

Three-way factorial analysis of variance (with species, sex and location as main effects) indicates significant interaction of species and location for all indices of bone economy and efficiency. Sex is significant as a main effect or interacting with location in all indices of cortical area.

While allometric effects are not readily discernible in these data, the null hypothesis of a common pattern of bone utilization is decisively rejected. Human mandibles use relatively more cortical bone than those of great apes, particularly in anterior regions of the corpus. Among the apes, orangutans use very little cortical bone to achieve mechanical stiffness. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This is particularly true for the Greater Virunga. Landscape, which includes Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and ten contiguous protected areas in Uganda and Rwanda. The larger bodied animal species that occur in this landscape have moved freely across what are now international borders for millennia and some species probably need this larger landscape if their populations are to remain viable. An analysis was carried out to identify these 'landscape species' and the importance of this cross-border movement is assessed in the light of civil wars in the region. For 13 years the International Gorilla Conservation Programme has been working in the Virunga Volcanoes and Bwindi Impenetrable National Park to foster transboundary collaboration. The results have shown that regular meetings and planning of activities by wardens can lead to better conservation even with countries at war with each other. More recently the Wildlife Conservation Society has started a programme to support transboundary collaboration further north in the landscape so that all contiguous protected areas are working together. The results show that mountain gorilla numbers have on the whole increased during the past 25 years despite civil wars in the region and this can largely be attributed to their ability to generate income from tourism but also to enhanced transboundary collaboration between Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. Ungulate numbers on the other hand have declined drastically since the 1960s but it is shown that the connectivity in the landscape has been important in reducing the impact of the civil war on elephants.

The replication profiles of three genes from different regions of chromosome X (ZFX, XIST and ATRX) were used as terms of reference. Particular emphasis was given to the evaluation of allelic replication asynchrony in relation to the inactivation status of each gene. The human cell types analysed include neuronal cells and ICF syndrome cells, considered to be a model system for the study of X inactivation. PCDH11 appeared to be generally characterized by replication asynchrony in both male and female cells, and no significant differences were observed between human and gorilla, in which this gene lacks X-Y homologous status. However, in differentiated human neuroblastoma and cerebral cortical cells PCDH11X replication profile showed a significant shift towards allelic synchrony.

Dolphins and African apes: comparisons of sympatric socio-ecology,"['Bearzi, M', 'Stanford, CB']",CONTRIBUTIONS TO ZOOLOGY,NA,2007,4,"Dolphins and African apes are distantly related mammalian taxa that exhibit striking convergences in their socioecology. In both cetaceans and African apes, two or more closely related species sometimes occur in sympatry. However, detailed reviews of the ways in which sympatric associations of dolphins and apes are similar have not been done. As field studies of dolphins and apes have accumulated, comparisons of how the two groups avoid direct food competition when in sympatry have become possible. In this paper we review sympatric ecology among dolphins and African apes, and examine convergences in species-associations in each taxa.

We sequenced the microsatellite of the TBP gene of 25 unrelated individuals from northern Germany (10 SCA17 patients and 15 unaffected control individuals). In addition, the microsatellites were sequenced from individuals of 10 northern German families with at least one family member affected by SCA17. To study also the evolutionary history of this CAG/CAA microsatellite in nonhuman primates, the homologous regions were analysed from Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, P. abellii, Hylobates lar, Nomascus leucogenys, Symphalangus syndactylus, Macaca mulatta, Papio hamadryas, Colobus polykomos and Callithrix jacchus. Three major conclusions were drawn: (i) Patterns of synonymous CAA interruptions in the microsatellite are characteristic and likely to result from selection for stabilizing the repetitive region; (ii) Interspecific comparisons indicate that SCA17 is likely to be a human trait. The most common allele in humans (37 repeats) is close to the threshold value upon which neurodegenerative changes can occur and may act as a repository for expanded, pathogenic alleles; (iii) The cassette-like structure of five out of 17 expanded alleles can be attributed to unequal crossing over. This can explain the rare and sporadic de novo generation of SCA17 alleles."
"Ontogeny and Phylogeny of the pelvis in Gorilla, Pongo, Pan, Australopithecus and Homo","['Williams, FL', 'Orban, R']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000097060,2007,4,"To examine the evolutionary differences between hominoid locomotor systems, a number of observations concerning the growth of the pelvis among the great apes as compared to modern and fossil hominids are reported. We are interested in the size and shape of the coxal bones at different developmental stages across species that may elucidate the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny ( i. e., heterochrony) in the hominoid pelvis. Our hypotheses are: ( 1) do rates of absolute growth differ?, ( 2) do rates of relative growth differ?, and ( 3) does heterochrony explain these differences? Bivariate and multivariate analyses of pelvic dimensions demonstrate both the diversity of species-specific ontogenetic patterns among hominoids, and an unequivocal separation of hominids and the great apes. Heterochrony alone fails to account for the ontogenetic differences between hominids and the great apes. Compared to recent Homo, Australopithecus can be described as 'hyper- human' from the relative size of the ischium, and short but broad ilium. Australopithecus afarensis differs from Australopithecus africanus by its relatively long pubis. In multivariate analyses of ilium shape, the most complete coxal bone attributed to Homo erectus, KNM- ER 3228, falls within the range of juvenile and adult Australopithecus, whereas Broken Hill falls within the range of modern Homo, suggesting that the modern human ilium shape arose rather recently. Among the great apes, patterns of pelvic ontogeny do not exclusively separate the African apes from Pongo. Copyright (C) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel"
Influence of social and environmental factors on nesting behaviour in captive gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Weiche, I', 'Anderson, JR']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000099137,2007,1,"Field studies on gorilla sleeping sites usually emphasize environmental influences on nest site selection, as individual nesting behaviours are usually not observed directly. In captivity, nesting behaviour and influencing factors are often overlooked. In the present study, the sleeping sites of members of a captive group of 16 - 21 gorillas were analysed, based on 152 nights over a 5-year period. Subadults tended to sleep apart from adults but clustered around the oldest blackback male. Full siblings and mothers with offspring were often nearest neighbours. Some sleeping dyads notably endured. Neither age of offspring nor rank of adult females influenced neighbour choice or distances; an interadult distance of 1.5-3 m was typical. Group dynamics were reflected in nesting arrangements. We suggest that possibilities for co-nesting and choice of sleeping sites should be provided to improve the welfare of captive gorillas and other great apes. Copyright (C) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel"

Currently, the most plausible working hypothesis is that at least chimpanzees know what others can and cannot see. Using tasks with a high ecological validity and mapping out key concepts such association and inference are postulated as fundamental steps to further advance our knowledge in this area."
Molecular Relationship of Hylobates Based on Alu Elements of the Y Chromosome,"['홍경원', '허재원', 'Heui-Soo, Kim', '김대수', '하홍석']",Genes and Genomics,NA,2007,0,"The phylogenetic relationship among the subgenus Hylobates has been debated by morphological and molecular data. We examined such relationship by comparing nucleotide sequences of a Y chromosomal gene, translation initiation factor 1A Y chromosome (EIF1AY), in humans, chimpanzes, gorillas, orangutans and five species of gibons (white-handed gibon, agile gibbon, klos’s gibon, muller’s gibon, pileated gibbon) using PCR amplification and sequencing. Among hominoid primates, gibons alone contained Alu elements in their EIF1AY gene of the Y chromosome. In adition, new diagnostic mutation sites named AluYHy as new Alu member were identified in gibbons. Phylogenetic analysis of AluYHy sequences indicated a sister relationship between H. lar and H. klossii. These sugest that the new AluYHy of Y chromosome can be use for understanding gibon phylogeny and evolution."

Play behaviour is an ontogenetic trait in many mammalian species and is widely believed to have an important role in the assembly of adult behaviour. However play may be at work also during some peculiar situations favouring cohesion and social manipulation. Here, I investigate some topics on social play. Firstly, I investigate the social mechanisms which are at the basis of the play-partner choice by exploring the ""play intensity watching"" hypothesis. Original data are used to examine how young chimpanzees modulate play sessions by using play signals (meta-communication). Secondly, I present data on the distribution Of social play and grooming in the periods around feeding time and in a control condition, showing that play frequencies between adults and unrelated subjects are significantly higher during pre-feeding. I discuss the possibility that play behaviour can be used to prevent conflict escalation and to increase a peaceful co-feeding (pre-conflict management). Finally, in a comparative approach, I contrast data collected on the two Pan species in order to evaluate whether, despite their phylogenetic closeness and similar social structure (fission-fusion society), chimpanzees and bonobos (Pan paniscus) show differences in adult play behavior."
Toward a science of welfare for animals in the zoo,"['Maple, TL']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,NA,2007,12,"Although the accredited institutions of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums have all committed to enhancing the welfare of nonhuman animals, acceptable standards and best practices are still under debate. Currently, experts from zoos and the field hold widely divergent opinions about exhibition and management standards for elephants. Standards and practices for managing nonhuman primates provide a model for other nonhuman creatures exhibited in zoos and aquariums. Examining the key issues for primates demonstrates the value of applying scientific data before promulgating standards. The field of applied behavior analysis provides a wealth of information to frame the debate. Animal behaviorists have contributed to an emerging science of animal welfare, which may provide a foundation for empirical zoo management, standards, and practices."
The role of behavioral research in the conservation of chimpanzees and gorillas,"['Lonsdorf, EV']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,NA,2007,5,"Chimpanzees and gorillas are among man's closest living relatives, sharing most of the human genetic code and having many similarities to humans in anatomy, physiology, and behavior. Like humans, these apes make and use tools and have strong family bonds. Chimpanzees even show population-specific behaviors similar to those of human cultures. However, chimpanzee and gorilla populations are in dramatic decline due to bushmeat hunting, habitat loss, and the varied risks of small, isolated populations. The first step in conserving the world's ape populations in the wild is to recognize and understand the complexities of these threats. Mitigating the risks takes a deeper understanding of ape behavior. This article provides examples of how gorilla and chimpanzee behavioral studies intersect with, and are critical to, conservation efforts."

In captivity, they spend most time on exhibit sleeping or pacing. To better understand their activity budget, this study examined the daily behavior patterns of 2 Sumatran tigers and 3 African lions in different housings. The proportion of scans the large felids spent engaged in stereotypic pacing varied by time of day and environment. The tigers spent different amounts of time pacing when housed in different exhibits; the lions paced more in off-exhibit housing than when on exhibit. These differences suggest changes to the cats' immediate housing environment may decrease pacing but provide little insight into altering specifics. Carnivores' pacing relates to their inability to control sensory access to social partners. Both environments with increased pacing contained chain-link fencing. allowing uncontrolled sensory contact. Where the tigers paced, the study placed a visual barrier between one female and keepers' or conspecifics' cues. This did not significantly decrease pacing. However, the study suggests considering sensory access and environmental variables when designing environments for captive carnivores."
Visitors' effects on the welfare of animals in the zoo: A review,"['Davey, G']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,NA,2007,25,"Since the 1970s, research about zoo visitors' effects on the welfare of nonhuman animals in captivity has intensified. Numerous studies have shown that characteristics such as visitor presence, density, activity, size, and position are associated with animal behavioral and-to a lesser extent physiological-changes. Studies usually interpret these changes as negative (undesirable) or positive (enriching), but it remains unclear whether they significantly impinge on animal welfare. To make confident conclusions about visitors' effects necessitates more studies using (a) a wider range of animal groupings, (b) measures of stress, (c) visitor-animal variables, and (d) other methodological improvements In the meantime, in addition to further research, individual zoos need to emphasize (a) monitoring the stress indicators of their captive animals, (b) observing visitor behavior, and (c) ensuring that staffs are aware of the ""visitor effect"" concept."

However, this modality has not been tested in chimpanzees. The authors tested these methods in a 15-year-oLd male chimpanzee (Pon troglodytes) with a seven-year history of regurgitation and reingestion by alternately providing additional opportunities to forage or giving daily browse. The results show that providing browse on a daily basis models the feeding behavior of wild chimpanzees and is a successful way to reduce regurgitation and reingestion in a chimpanzee unresponsive to previous dietary changes."

In this study, we used samples from both western (Gorilla gorilla) and eastern (Gorilla beringei) gorillas to infer the timing of the split between these geographically disjunct populations and to elaborate the demographic history of gorillas. Here we present DNA sequences from 16 noncoding autosomal loci from 15 western gorillas and 3 eastern gorillas, including 2 noninvasively sampled free-ranging individuals. We find that the genetic diversity of gorillas is similar to that of chimpanzees but almost twice as high as that of bonobos and humans. A significantly positive Fu & Li's D was observed for western gorillas, suggesting a complex demographic history with a constant, long-term population size and ancestral population structure. Among different population-split scenarios, our data suggest a complex history of western and eastern gorillas including an initial population split at around 0.9-1.6 MYA and subsequent, primarily male-mediated gene flow until approximately 80,000-200,000 years ago. Furthermore, simulations revealed that more gene flow took place from eastern to western gorilla populations than vice versa."

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a critical cytokine in the immune response whose transcriptional activation is controlled by a proximal promoter region that is highly conserved in mammals and, in particular, primates. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) upstream of the proximal human TNF promoter have been identified, which are markers of human ancestry. Methodology/Principal findings. Using a comparative genomics approach we show that certain fixed genetic differences in the TNF promoter serve as markers of primate speciation. We also demonstrate that distinct alleles of most human TNF promoter SNPs are identical to fixed nucleotides in primate TNF promoters. Furthermore, we identify fixed genetic differences within the proximal TNF promoters of Asian apes that do not occur in African ape or human TNF promoters. Strikingly, protein-DNA binding assays and gene reporter assays comparing these Asian ape TNF promoters to African ape and human TNF promoters demonstrate that, unlike the fixed differences that we define that are associated with primate phylogeny, these Asian ape-specific fixed differences impair transcription factor binding at an Sp1 site and decrease TNF transcription induced by bacterial stimulation of macrophages. Conclusions/significance. Here, we have presented the broadest interspecies comparison of a regulatory region of an innate immune response gene to date. We have characterized nucleotide positions in Asian ape TNF promoters that underlie functional changes in cell type-and stimulus-specific activation of the TNF gene. We have also identified ancestral TNF promoter nucleotide states in the primate lineage that correspond to human SNP alleles. These findings may reflect evolution of Asian and African apes under a distinct set of infectious disease pressures involving the innate immune response and TNF."

During an eight-month study 44 bed sites and 506 beds were found. Among these, 38.6% of bed sites and 4.1% of beds were reused. We analyzed the monthly frequency of bed-site reuse in relation to rainfall, fruit abundance, and fruit consumption by the gorillas. The different frequency of bed-site reuse in the rainy and dry seasons was not significant. More bed-site reuse was observed during the fruiting season than during the non-fruiting season. Results from fecal analysis suggested that gorillas ate more fruit in the fruiting season than in the non-fruiting season. The frugivorous diet of western gorillas may possibly cause gorillas to stay in some areas and, consequently, reuse their bed sites. Reuse of bed sites by gorillas suggests their frequent return to an area where preferred fruit is readily available. A higher percentage of arboreal beds may also affect bed-site reuse, because of the shortage of bed material."
'What's in a picture'?

Excluding the one bonobo picture, I analyzed 396 works in terms of number of colors, first and last color preferences, use of novel colors, respect for boundaries, negative space, placement, and pattern. Where possible, I compared outputs by gender as well as by species. My most significant discoveries were the almost universal preferences for yellow as a first color (although blue occurred in more pictures), the high use of diagonal lines by all species, the preference for novel brown of all constructed colors, and the preference for centered patterns. The features that distinguished species included numbers of colors chosen, level of respect for boundaries, frequency of negative spaces in pictures, and last color preferences. Males and females showed overall differences in last color preference (which ends up being the final emphasis of the piece), males focused on the use of four colors, and showed less respect for boundaries. Females used a wider range of colors, a central placement, and nearly half the time, stayed inside the confines of the page. These differences strongly support the hypothesis that there are considered choices occurring in the production of these pictures which can reveal some idea of how various species see and respond to stimuli. These are definitely not random scribbles, and are worth investigation for their metacommunicative content."

It has been reported elsewhere that 98 carcasses of wild animals were found in systematic studies in northeastern Gabon and adjoining northwestern Republic of the Congo (RoC) during five EHF epidemics in August 2001 to June 2003, with Ebola virus infection being confirmed in 14 carcasses. During the present opportunistic observations, reports were investigated of a further 397 carcasses, mainly gorillas, chimpanzees, mandrills and bush pigs, found by rural residents in 35 incidents in Gabon and RoC during 1994-2003. Sixteen incidents had temporal and/or spatial coincidence with confirmed EHF outbreaks, and the remaining 19 appeared to represent extension of disease from such sites. There appeared to be sustained Ebola virus activity in the northeast in 1994-1999, with sequential spread from 1996 onwards, first westwards, then southerly, and then north-eastwards, reaching the Gabon-RoC border in 2001. This implies that there was transmission of infection between wild mammals, but the species involved are highly susceptible and unlikely to be natural hosts of the virus.

Some captive breeding programs promote all-male groups as an adequate option to house surplus males, but there have been few attempts to assess the feasibility of this management technique across primate species. The present study provides preliminary data regarding social compatibility within a newly formed all-male group of four white crowned mangabeys (Cercocebus atys lunulatus). The study was conducted at the Valencia Zoo (Spain), where data on social behavior were collected over 6 months using continuous focal animal sampling for a total of 87 hr of observation. Results show that low intensity aggressive behaviors (facial threats) were expressed at high rates, whereas physical aggression (fights) rarely occurred. Aggression was more frequent among individuals belonging to the same age-gender class. Regarding affiliative behaviors, every individual actively sought proximity to all other group members through positive approaches, and although not all males carried out social grooming, every male was groomed by at least one group member. Our results suggest that the group was compatible socially because social relationships among the individuals were not neutral, and physical aggression occurred at low rates. The present study provides preliminary data supporting the feasibility of all-male groups as a management option for surplus males in captive populations of white crowned mangabeys. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to be able to generalize both within and across species."

Age-related patterns may be influenced by changes in maternal experience or physical condition, and they may reflect maternal investment trade-offs between current versus future reproduction. This article examines the influences of age and parity upon the interbirth intervals (IBI), offspring survival, and birth rates of 66 female mountain gorillas in the Virunga Volcano region from 1967-2004. Fertility was relatively low for females below age 12; improved as they matured; and then declined as they aged further. Primiparous mothers had 50% higher offspring mortality and 20% longer IBI than second-time mothers, though only the difference with IBI was statistically significant. The length of subsequent IBI was positively correlated with birth order but not with the mother's age. Mountain gorillas showed no evidence of an extended postreproductive lifespan. Age-related patterns seem most likely to reflect changes in the physical condition of the mother, but more detailed studies are needed to quantify those physical differences, and to obtain behavioral evidence that would provide more direct measures of maternal investment and experience."

We present results from a nationwide zoo-based study on behavioral and hormonal changes in female western gorillas. We evaluated progestogen concentrations via daily fecal sampling in 30 gorillas, 22 of which were geriatric (>= 30). We collected concurrent behavioral data 1-3 times weekly on 16 of the females. While control females cycled regularly, ca. 23% of geriatric females are acyclic (menopausal), and another 32% show variable hormonal patterns suggesting perimenopause. Patterns included increased variability in cycle length and peak progestogen values, and frequent insufficient increases in progestogen levels during the luteal phase. Acyclic females have significantly lower overall progestogen concentrations than the self cycling females, though differences are not significant when cycle phase is incorporated. We detected behavioral estrus in 9 of 10 cycling females for which data were available. In all but 1 case, proceptive behavior occurred during the follicular phase, preceding ovulation on average by 6.6 d. Females spent more time in proximity to the silverback male while in behavioral estrus than during other periods. To date, maximum longevity in captive female gorillas is 52 yr, with poor reproductive prognosis beginning from the age of 37. We demonstrate that both perimenopause and menopause characterize aged female gorillas, which may experience a postreproductive lifespan of > 25% of their lives. Continued study of aging apes is warranted, and apes may serve as models for age-related reproductive changes in humans."

Two of four analysed Hmgn2 retropseudogenes were specific for the human genome. whereas a third was identified in human. chimpanzee and gorilla genomes, and a fourth additionally found in orangutan but absent in African green monkey.

The human Hmgn2 retropseudogenes. were full length, whereas the mouse Hmg1 elements were either full length or 3'-truncated at specific positions, most plausibly the result of use of alternative polyadenylation sites. The nature of their recent amplification success in relation to other retropseudogenes is unclear. although availability of a large number of transcripts during gametogenesis may be a reason. It is apparent that retropseudogenes continue to shape mammalian genomes. and may provide insight into the process of retrotransposition, as well as offer potential use as phylogenetic markers."
Hepatitis viruses in non-human primates,"['Makuwa, M', 'Souquiere, S', 'Telfer, P', 'Bourry, O', 'Rouquet, P', 'Kazanji, M', 'Roques, P', 'Simon, F']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1111/j.1600-0684.2006.00163.x,DEC 2006,20,"Background Previous epidemiological studies of rural human populations in Gabon reveal a high prevalence of human hepatitis A, B, C and D viruses. In order to investigate the prevalence of the blood-born hepatitis viruses in apes and monkeys living in the same area, we performed an epidemiological survey of HBV, HCV and HDV in wild-born non-human primates.

Methods We tested 441 wild-born non-human primates from Gabon and Congo and 132 imported monkeys for the presence of serological markers of HBV, HCV and HDV infections.

Results None of Cercopithecidae monkeys were reactive against HBV/HDV and HCV. In contrast, 29.2% of wild-born great apes (154 chimpanzees and 14 gorillas) were positive for HBV serological markers. Nine chimpanzees were in the replicative phase of HBV infection. None of these HBV infected chimpanzees exhibited symptoms or significant changes in serum clinical chemistry related to HBV infection.

Conclusions The negativity to HCV-related viruses and the negativity of the Cercopithecidae species tested against HBV/HDV do not allow us to definitively rule out the presence of an animal counterpart of human hepatitis viruses in non-human primates."

Resolution of a hyperprolactinemia in a western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Chatfield, J', 'Zhang, L', 'Ramey, J', 'Bowsher, T', 'Loskutoff, N', ""O'Neill, K""]",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/06-050.1,DEC 2006,3,"Prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas are one of the most common causes of infertility in women. Prolactin plays an important role in lactation and is involved in producing some of the normal mammalian breeding and maternal behaviors. Elevated Serum prolactin concentrations call adversely affect the reproductive cycle in females by inhibiting the normal lutenizing hormone surge that stimulates Ovulation. A 17-year-old western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) presented with low fertility and hyperprolactinemia. An MRI confirmed a pituitary mass and treatment was initiated with cabergoline. Following 8 mo of treatment, mass size decreased and serum prolactin was within normal limits. The gorilla began to engage in normal breeding behavior, and within 6 mo of completing treatment, was pregnant. Hyperprolactinemia, secondary to presumed nucroprolactinoma, may be more common among breeding-age gorillas than is Currently diagnosed and ill humans is an easily diagnosed and treatable condition."

Orangutan positional behavior and the nature of arboreal locomotion in Hominoidea,"['Thorpe, SKS', 'Crompton, RH']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20422,NOV 2006,84,"The Asian apes, more than any other, are restricted to an arboreal habitat. They are consequently an important model in the interpretation of the morphological commonalities of the apes, which are locomotor features associated with arboreal living. This paper presents a de tailed analysis of orangutan positional behavior for all age-sex categories and during a complete range of behavioral contexts, following standardized positional mode descriptions proposed by Hunt et al. ([1996] Primates 37:363-387). This paper shows that orangutan positional behavior is highly complex, representing a diverse spectrum of positional modes. Overall, all orthograde and pronograde suspensory postures are exhibited less frequently in the present study than previously reported. Orthograde suspensory locomotion is also exhibited less often, whereas pronograde and orthograde compressive locomotor modes are observed more frequently. Given the complexity of orangutan positional behavior demonstrated by this study, it is likely that differences in positional behavior between studies reflect differences in the interplay between the complex array of variables, which were shown to influence orangutan positional behavior (Thorpe and Crompton [2005] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 127:58-78). With the exception of pronograde suspensory posture and locomotion, orangutan positional behavior is similar to that of the African apes, and in particular, lowland gorillas. This study suggests that it is orthogrady in general, rather than forelimb suspend specifically, that characterizes the positional behavior of hominoids."
A note on the effect of auditory stimulation on the behaviour and welfare of zoo-housed gorillas,"['Wells, DL', 'Coleman, D', 'Challis, MG']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2005.12.003,NOV 2006,14,"Auditory stimulation has long been employed as a form of therapy for humans and animals housed in institutions. Its effect on one of our closest-living relatives, the gorilla, however, is largely unknown. This study explored the effect of auditory stimulation on the behaviour and welfare of six gorillas housed in Belfast Zoo. All animals were exposed to three conditions of auditory stimulation: a control (no auditory stimulation), an ecologically relevant condition (rainforest sounds) and an ecologically non-relevant condition (classical music). The gorillas' behaviour was recorded in each condition using a scan-sampling technique. There was no significant effect of the auditory environment on the gorillas' behaviour, although animals tended to show more behaviours suggestive of relaxation (i.e. resting, sitting) and fewer behaviours typically associated with stress (i.e. aggression, abnormal behaviour) during the ecologically relevant, and, in particular, the non-relevant, conditions than the control. Overall, findings suggest that certain types of auditory stimulation may hold some merit as a method of enrichment for zoo-housed gorillas, although more long-term work with a larger number of animals is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.

Dental metric comparisons of Morotopithecus and Afropithecus: Implications for the validity of the genus Morotopithecus,"['Patel, BA', 'Grossman, A', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.07.002,NOV 2006,7,"Morotopithecus bishopi and Afropithecus turkanensis are two large-bodied hominoid primates from early Miocene deposits of eastern Africa. Researchers have used both cranial and postcranial characters to distinguish these two species. Unfortunately, of the fossil material attributed to each, only the face, palate, and upper dentition are preserved well enough in both species for direct comparisons. There are currently no known directly comparable postcranial elements. In this study, we reevaluated dental characters argued to distinguish the type specimens of Morotopithecus from Afropithecus: relative size of the upper premolars and M-3. Exact randomization methods were used to address two questions. First, is it possible to find the degree of dental-size difference observed between Morotopithecus (UMP 62-11) and Afropithecus (KNM-WK 16999) within extant African hominoids? Second, what is the probability of observing the levels of difference found between the fossils among pairs of extant individuals? Metric differences in relative premolar and M-3 size were calculated between all possible pairs within the extant sample and the observed difference of the fossil pair was then compared to the resulting distribution of extant pairs. The observed size differences for all comparisons in the fossil teeth were well within the variation observed in the extant African hominoid samples (p > 0.05). In light of these results and other currently available cranial evidence, we suggest that the type specimens of Morotopithecus and Afropithecus are not different enough to support taxonomic distinction.

Hominoid-specific SPANXA/D genes demonstrate differential expression in individuals and protein localization to a distinct nuclear envelope domain during spermatid morphogenesis,"['Westbrook, VA', 'Schoppee, PD', 'Vanage, GR', 'Klotz, KL', 'Diekman, AB', 'Flickinger, CJ', 'Coppola, MA', 'Herr, JC']",MOLECULAR HUMAN REPRODUCTION,10.1093/molehr/gal079,NOV 2006,16,"Human sperm protein associated with the nucleus on the X chromosome consists of a five-member gene family (SPANXA1, SPANXA2, SPANXB, SPANXC and SPANXD) clustered at Xq27.1. Evolved from an ancestral SPANX-N gene family (at Xq27 and Xp11) present in all primates as well as in rats and mice, the SPANXA/D family is present only in humans, bonobos, chimpanzees and gorillas. Among hominoid-specific genes, the SPANXA/D gene family is considered to be undergoing rapid positive selection in its coding region. In this study, RT-PCR of human testis mRNA from individuals showed that, although all SPANXA/D genes are expressed in humans, differences are evident. In particular, SPANXC is expressed only in a subset of men. The SPANXa/d protein localized to the nuclear envelope of round, condensing and elongating spermatids, specifically to regions that do not underlie the developing acrosome. During spermiogenesis, the SPANXa/d-positive domain migrated into the base of the head as the redundant nuclear envelope that protrudes into the residual cytoplasm. Post-testicular modification of the SPANXa/d proteins was noted, as were PEST (proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine rich regions) domains. It is concluded that the duplication of the SPANX-N gene family that occurred 6-11 MYA resulted in a new gene family, SPANXA/D, that plays a role during spermiogenesis. The SPANXa/d gene products are among the few examples of X-linked nuclear proteins expressed following meiosis. Their localization to non-acrosomal domains of the nuclear envelope adjacent to regions of euchromatin and their redistribution to the redundant nuclear envelope during spermiogenesis provide a biomarker for the redundant nuclear envelope of spermatids and spermatozoa."

Great apes show highly selective plasma carotenoids and have physiologically high plasma retinyl esters compared to humans,"['Garcia, AL', 'Raila, J', 'Koebnick, C', 'Eulenberger, K', 'Schweigert, FJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20428,OCT 2006,3,"Great apes are the closest living relatives of humans. Physiological similarities between great apes and humans provide clues to identify which biological features in humans are primitive or derived from great apes. Vitamin A (VA) and carotenoid metabolism have been only partially studied in great apes, and comparisons between great apes and humans are not available. We aimed to investigate VA and carotenoid intake and plasma concentrations in great apes living in captivity, and to compare them to healthy humans. Dietary intakes of humans (n = 20) and, among the great apes, chimpanzees (n = 15) and orangutans (n = 5) were calculated. Plasma retinol (ROH), retinol-binding protein (RBP), retinyl esters, and major carotenoids were analyzed. The great ape diet was higher in VA than in humans, due to high intake of provitamin A carotenoids. Plasma ROH concentrations in great apes were similar to those in humans, but retinyl esters were higher in great apes than in humans. Differences in plasma carotenoid concentrations were observed between great apes and humans. Lutein was the main carotenoid in great apes, while P-carotene was the main carotenoid for humans. RBP concentrations did not differ between great apes and humans. The molar ratio of ROH to RBP was close to 1.0 in both great apes and humans. In conclusion, great apes show homeostatic ROH regulation, with high but physiological retinyl esters circulating in plasma. Furthermore, great apes show great selectivity in their plasmatic carotenoid concentration, which is not explained by dietary intake."
Application of an image-based weighted measure of skeletal bending stiffness to great ape mandibles,"['Bhatavadekar, NB', 'Daegling, DJ', 'Rapoff, AJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20397,OCT 2006,11,"Traditional measures of structural stiffness in the primate skeleton do not consider the heterogeneous material stiffness distribution of bone. This assumption of homogeneity introduces an unknown degree of error in estimating stiffness in skeletal elements. Measures of weighted stiffness can be developed by including heterogeneous grayscale variations evident in computed tomographic (CT) images. Since gray scale correlates with material stiffness, the distribution of bone quality and quantity can be simultaneously considered. We developed weighted measures of bending resistance and applied these to CT images at three locations along the mandibular corpus in the hominoids Gorilla, Pongo, and Pan. We calculated the traditional (unweighted) moment of inertia for comparison to our weighted measure, which weighs each pixel by its gray-scale value. This weighing results in assignment of reduced moment of inertia values to sections of reduced density. Our weighted and unweighted moments differ by up to 22%. These differences are not consistent among sections, however, such that they cannot be calculated by simple correction of unweighted moments. The effect of this result is that the rank ordering of individual sections within species changes if weighted moments are considered. These results suggest that the use of weighted moments may spur different interpretations of comparative data sets that rely on stiffness measures as estimates of biomechanical competence."
Differential use of attentional and visual communicative signaling by orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) in response to the attentional status of a human,"['Poss, SR', 'Kuhar, C', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Hopkins, WD']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20304,OCT 2006,34,"In this study we investigated the communicative abilities of 10 orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and seven western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and particularly focused on their sensitivity to the attentional state of a human experimenter when choosing from a repertoire of both auditory and visual communication strategies. In experiment 1 a banana was placed in front of the subject's cage and a human experimenter was either present or absent. The subject's behavior was recorded for 60 sec. Both gorillas and orangutans gestured (t(16) = -3.58, P <.005) and vocalized (t(16) = -2.47, P <.05) more when the experimenter was present. In experiment 2 a human experimenter held a banana in front of the subject's cage and was oriented either toward or away from the subject. Again the subject's behavior was recorded for 60 sec. In this experiment both gorillas and orangutans gestured significantly more frequently (t(16) = 3.40, P <.005) when the experimenter was oriented toward them. In addition, gorillas and orangutans used other forms of visual communication signals, such as lip pout (t(16) = 3.66, P <.005), barter/trade (t(16) = 2.31, P <.05), and body present (t(16) = 2.31, P <.05) significantly more when an experimenter was facing them. The overall results indicate that both gorillas and orangutans are sensitive to the attentional state of a human experimenter and use appropriate communicative signals to gain that individual's attention. These results are also similar to previous findings on communicative behaviors in chimpanzees."
Inferences by exclusion in the great apes: the effect of age and species,"['Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-006-0037-4,OCT 2006,44,"This study investigated the ability of chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos to make inferences by exclusion using the procedure pioneered by Premack and Premack (Cognition 50:347-362, 1994) with chimpanzees. Thirty apes were presented with two different food items (banana vs. grape) on a platform and covered with identical containers. One of the items was removed from the container and placed between the two containers so that subjects could see it. After discarding this item, subjects could select between the two containers. In Experiment 1, apes preferentially selected the container that held the item that the experimenter had not discarded, especially if subjects saw the experimenter remove the item from the container (but without seeing the container empty). Experiment 3 in which the food was removed from one of the containers behind a barrier confirmed these results. In contrast, subjects performed at chance levels when a stimulus (colored plastic chip: Exp. 1; food item: Exp. 2 and Exp. 3) designated the item that had been removed. These results indicated that apes made inferences, not just learned to use a discriminative cue to avoid the empty container. Apes perceived and treated the item discarded by the experimenter as if it were the very one that had been hidden under the container. Results suggested a positive relationship between. age and inferential ability independent of memory ability but no species differences."

Alignment of the primates' orthologic nucleotide sequences reveals high extent of similarity, with the exception of highly repetitious region between the two Alu repeats, nearest to the onset of transcription. Data obtained have been analyzed for further understanding of the evolution of repetitive sequences.

The few studies on groups of the same species in captivity and in the wild and the overall comparison across species of findings from studies in both settings have reported patterns of variation in the rates of various postconflict affinitive behaviors that may be setting related. In fact, some authors have claimed that the high rates of postconflict affiliation reported in captive studies could represent an artifact of captivity. I explored the claim and conclude that it is unjustified. I argue that the dichotomy captivity vs. wild is conceptually meaningless and scientists should abandon it as an explanatory variable, that differences across studies both in setting-related variables and in the methods used for assessing postconflict affiliation reduce the strength of comparisons within and across settings, that the empirical evidence thus far available neither allows adequate assessment nor supports any claim that links the rate of postconflict affiliation to captivity or wild conditions, and that studies conducted in both settings may be equally useful-and should be used-to test theoretically relevant hypotheses regarding the causes and predictors of variation in postconflict affiliation. Instead of asking the title question, I would ask which variables influence postconflict affiliation and then whether the variables are really associated only with one of the two settings."

We found the same trend for reconciliation that wild mountain gorillas show: reconciliation occurred only between adult male-female dyads, while it was absent in the other sex-age class combination. There were both solicited and nonsolicited contacts; the latter finding is in contrast with the result obtained in wild mountain gorillas, in which consolation was absent. Immature females were more likely to offer consolation toward both related and unrelated individuals. Consolation did not reduce the likelihood of further attacks among group members. It may be that, as the alpha-male plays a fundamental role in preventing the spread of conflicts throughout the entire group, triadic contacts become ineffective for the function. The levels of consolation were higher in absence of reconciliation than in its presence, suggesting that consolation may function as an alternative mechanism in stress reduction of the victim."
Bootstrap tests of significance and the case for humanlike skeletal-size dimorphism in Australopithecus afarensis,"['Scott, JE', 'Stroik, LK']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.06.001,OCT 2006,17,"Most estimates of sexual size dimorphism in Australopithecus afarensis indicate that this early hominin was more dimorphic than modem humans. In contrast, a recent study reported that size variation in A. afarensis, as represented by postcranial remains from Hadar and Maka, Ethiopia, is statistically most similar to that of modem humans, indicating a humanlike level of sexual dimorphism. Here, we evaluate the evidence for humanlike dimorphism in A. afarensis. We argue that statistical support for this claim is not as robust as has been asserted for the following reasons: (1) the analysis from which the claim was derived does not distinguish the A. afarensis sample from either the human or chimpanzee samples; (2) for some of the comparisons made, the A. afarensis sample cannot be distinguished from the Gorilla sample using two-tailed tests; and (3) the A. afarensis postcranial sample used in the analysis may contain more male than female specimens, which precludes a straightforward interpretation of the statistical results. Thus, support for humanlike dimorphism is equivocal, and a greater level of dimorphism cannot be ruled out. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

A survey of the Bwindi population was carried out in 2002 and results were compared with the previous census in 1997. Our estimate of total population size increased over that period by c. 7% to 320 individuals and the structure and distribution of the population were largely unchanged. Signs of human disturbance were more common in 2002 than 1997, and gorillas tended to be found in areas of relative low disturbance. This suggested that disturbance could be a constraint on population growth and distribution but demographic stochasticity may also be responsible for the observed level of population change over a short time period. Other potential limiting factors, including habitat availability and disease, are discussed. While conservation activities in Bwindi have probably contributed to the stability of the population, strengthening of law enforcement and continued vigilance are needed to ensure the population's long-term growth and survival."

This study quantifies for the first time aspects of encounters between gorillas and tourists at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park that are likely to contribute to the risk of disease transmission. These include how close tourists get to gorillas, how close encounters are initiated, how long they last, and the age class of gorillas involved. Tourists got significantly closer to gorillas than the park rules allow (a mean of 2.76 m, compared to the rule of 7 m), and remained close for long periods. Contacts with the gorillas most vulnerable to disease, the juveniles, were closer but of shorter duration than those with adults. Contacts initiated by gorillas were closer but shorter than those initiated by tourists. Taken together these results demonstrate that the present rules are failing, and that the risk of disease transmission may be greater than previously believed."
Food transfers in immature wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Nowell, AA', 'Fletcher, AW']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-006-0181-0,OCT 2006,10,"The transfer of food items between individuals has been described in primates as serving an informative purpose in addition to supplementing the diet of immature individuals. This behaviour has yet to be described in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and results are presented here of observations of food transfers in immature gorillas at Mbeli Bai, Republic of Congo. The frequency of food transfers decreased with increasing immature age, while the frequency of independent feeding and processing of food increased. Transfers between mothers and infants were the most frequent, with infants attempting to take items from the mother. These attempts were not always successful and the item was relinquished on less than 50% of attempts. Mothers also took items from their offspring. The results point to the functional significance of food transfers in western lowland gorillas being informational. In a bai environment, where one species forms the majority of a visiting gorilla's diet despite other species being available, the initiation of food transfers by immatures is proposed to serve the purpose of familiarising them with which species, and which parts of those species, may be eaten."

Human VNTRs have been shown to affect transcriptional activity, and some reports suggest that VNTR polymorphisms are associated with psychoneurological disorders. VNTR polymorphism has also been reported in the ape MAOA promoter but the transcriptional activities of the alleles remain to be determined. In the present study, we sequenced the 1.3-kb promoter region of ape MAOA and compared the transcriptional activities of ape MAOA promoter sequences with those of humans. All apes examined were polymorphic in the region corresponding to the human VNTR and two, four, three, and two alleles were found in chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons, respectively. VNTR repeat structures in gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons were considerably different from those in humans and chimpanzees. In a human neuroblastoma cell line, most of the ape sequences that had a short repeat length (12 bp or 18 bp) exhibited higher promoter activity than a human 3-repeat sequence with a 30-bp repeat length. However, an intra-species difference dependent on the repeat number was not observed among the ape alleles examined. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
Decaying wood is a sodium source for mountain gorillas,"['Rothman, JM', 'Van Soest, PJ', 'Pell, AN']",BIOLOGY LETTERS,10.1098/rsbl.2006.0480,SEP 22 2006,39,"Like several other non-human primates, mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda consume decaying wood, an interesting but puzzling behaviour. This wood has little obvious nutritional value; it is low in protein and sugar, and high in lignin compared to other foods. We collected pieces of wood eaten and avoided by gorillas, and other foods consumed by gorillas, and measured their sodium content. Wood was substantially higher in sodium than other dietary items, and wood pieces from stumps eaten contained more sodium than those that were avoided. Wood represented only 3.9% of the wet weight food intake of gorillas, but contributed over 95% of dietary sodium, leading us to conclude that decaying wood is an important sodium source for Bwindi gorillas. Because sodium has been leached from the weathered soils characteristic of the subhumid and humid tropics, and because terrestrial plants generally do not require sodium, tropical herbivores, including gorillas, often encounter problems locating the sodium essential for their wellbeing. Decaying wood is an unexpected sodium source."

The skull of the approximately three-year-old presumed female shows that most features diagnostic of the species are evident even at this early stage of development. The find includes many previously unknown skeletal elements from the Pliocene hominin record, including a hyoid bone that has a typical African ape morphology. The foot and other evidence from the lower limb provide clear evidence for bipedal locomotion, but the gorilla-like scapula and long and curved manual phalanges raise new questions about the importance of arboreal behaviour in the A. afarensis locomotor repertoire."
Accelerated evolution of Protocadherin11X/Y: A candidate gene-pair for cerebral asymmetry and language,"['Williams, NA', 'Close, JP', 'Giouzeli, M', 'Crow, TJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART B-NEUROPSYCHIATRIC GENETICS,10.1002/ajmg.b.30357,SEP 5 2006,67,"It has been argued that cerebral asymmetry (the ""torque"") is the characteristic that defines the human brain and that morphological findings in psychosis are consistent with a deviation in this sex-dependent dimension of brain growth. Evidence from sex chromosome aneuploidies and an association within families between sex and handedness is consistent with the presence of a determinant of cerebral asymmetry (a possible correlate of language) on the X and the Y chromosomes. During hominid evolution a 3.5 Mb translocation occurred from the ancestral X chromosome to the Y chromosome, resulting in duplication of the Protocadherin11X gene, such that it is represented on the X and Y chromosomes in man, whereas there is a single X-linked gene in other mammals. We re-date the duplicative translocation to 6 million years ago, that is, close to the chimpanzee-hominid bifurcation. Sequence comparisons with the chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and orangutan indicate that in contrast to earlier purifying selection there has been accelerated change in the Protocadherin11X ectodomain as well as the Protocadherin11Y sequence in the hominid lineage since the duplication. The evolutionary sequence of events together with the prior case for an X-Y homologous gene suggests that this gene-pair is a candidate for the evolution of hominid-specific characteristics including the sexual dimorphism of cerebral asymmetry, a putative correlate of language.

"Patterns of craniofacial integration in extant Homo, Pan, and Gorilla
","['Polanski, JM', 'Franciscus, RG']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20421,SEP 2006,25,"Brain size increased greatly during Pleistocene human evolution, while overall facial and dentognathic size decreased markedly. This mosaic pattern is due to either selective forces that acted uniquely on each functional unit in a modularized, developmentally uncoupled craniofacial complex, or alternatively, selection that acted primarily on one unit, with the other responding passively as part of a coevolved set of ontogenetically and evolutionarily integrated structures. Using conditional independence modeling on homologous linear measurements of the height, breadth, and depth of the cranium in Pan (n = 95), Gorilla (n = 102), and recent Homo (n = 120), we reject the null hypothesis of equal levels of overall cranial integration. While all three groups share the pattern of greater neurocranial integration with distinct separation between the face and neurocranium (modularization), family differences do exist. The apes are more integrated in their entire crania, but display a particularly strong pattern of integration within the facial complex related to prognathism. Modern humans display virtually no facial integration, a pattern which is likely related to their markedly decreased facial projection. Modern humans also differ from their great ape counterparts in being more integrated within the breadth dimension of the cranial vault, likely tied to the increase in brain size and eventual globularity seen in human evolution. That the modern human integration pattern differs from the ancestral African great ape pattern along the inverse neurocranial-facial trend seen in human evolution indicates that this shift in the pattern of integration is evolutionarily significant, and may help to clarify aspects of the current debate over defining modern humans."

While this is the second anthrax outbreak in wild chimpanzees, this is the first case of anthrax in gorillas ever reported. The number of great apes in Central Africa is dramatically declining and the populations are seriously threatened by diseases, mainly Ebola. Nevertheless, a considerable number of deaths cannot be attributed to Ebola virus and remained unexplained. Our results show that diseases other than Ebola may also threaten wild great apes, and indicate that the role of anthrax in great ape mortality may have been underestimated. These results suggest that risk identification, assessment, and management for the survival of the last great apes should be performed with an open mind, since various pathogens with distinct characteristics in epidemiology and pathogenicity may impact the populations. An animal mortality monitoring network covering the entire African tropical forest, with the dual aims of preventing both great ape extinction and human disease outbreaks, will create necessary baseline data for such risk assessments and management plans.

"Clavicle, a neglected bone: Morphology and relation to arm movements and shoulder architecture in primates","['Voisin, JL']",ANATOMICAL RECORD PART A-DISCOVERIES IN MOLECULAR CELLULAR AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.a20354,SEP 2006,25,"In spite of its importance for movements of the upper limbs, the clavicle is an infrequently studied shoulder bone. The present study compares clavicular morphology among different extant primates. Methods have included the assessment of clavicular curvatures projected on two perpendicular planes that can be assessed overall as cranial and dorsal primary curvatures. Results showed that in cranial view, three morphologies can be defined. One group exhibited an external curvature considerably more pronounced than the internal one (Gorilla, Papio); a second group was characterized by an internal curvature much more pronounced than the external one (Hylobates, Ateles); and a third group contained those with the two curvatures equally pronounced (Pan, Homo, Pongo, Procolobus, Colobus). Clavicle curvatures projected on the dorsal plane could be placed into four groups. The first group is characterized by two curvatures, an inferior and a superior (Apes, Spider monkeys). The second included monkeys, whose clavicles have an inferior curvature much more pronounced than the superior one. The third group includes only Hylobates, whose clavicles possess only the superior curvature. The last group includes only modem humans, whose clavicles show only the inferior curvature, which is less pronounced than that which exists in monkeys. Curvatures in cranial view relate information regarding the parameters of arm elevation while those in dorsal view offer insights into the position of the scapula related to the thorax. The use of clavicular curvature analysis offers a new dimension in assessment of the functional morphology of the clavicle and its relationship to the shoulder complex."
Functional morphology of the first cervical vertebra in humans and nonhuman primates.,"['Manfreda, Evelyn', 'Mitteroecker, Philipp', 'Bookstein, Fred L', 'Schaefer, Katrin']","Anatomical record. Part B, New anatomist",10.1002/ar.b.20113,2006-Sep,15,"The cervical vertebral column bears or balances the weight of the head supported by the nuchal muscles that partly originate from the cervical vertebrae. The position of the head relative to the vertebral column, and consequently locomotion and posture behavior, could thus be associated with the form of the cervical vertebrae. In spite of this assumption and some empirical indications along these lines, primate vertebral morphologies have been reported to be very similar and not clearly related to locomotion. We therefore study the relationship between the morphology of the first cervical vertebra, the atlas, and the locomotion pattern within primates using a geometric morphometric approach. Our analysis is based on a total of 116 vertebrae of adult Homo sapiens, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, Hylobates lar, Macaca mulatta, Papio hamadryas, Ateles geoffroyi, and Alouatta palliata. On each atlas, 56 landmarks were digitized and superimposed by Procrustes registration. The resulting shape variables were analyzed by principal component analysis, multivariate regression, and partial least-squares analysis. We found that the nine primate species differ clearly in their atlas morphology and that allometric shape change is distinct between the nonhuman primates and Homo sapiens. We could further identify morphological features that relate to the species' locomotion pattern. Human atlas shape, however, cannot be predicted by an extrapolation of the nonhuman primate model. This implies that either the primate atlas is generalized enough to allow bipedal locomotion or else the human atlas morphology is a unique adaptation different from that in the more orthograde nonhuman primates.

A whole genome long-range haplotype (WGLRH) test for detecting imprints of positive selection in human populations,"['Zhang, C', 'Bailey, DK', 'Awad, T', 'Liu, GY', 'Xing, GL', 'Cao, MQ', 'Valmeekam, V', 'Retief, J', 'Matsuzaki, H', 'Taub, M', 'Seielstad, M', 'Kennedy, GC']",BIOINFORMATICS,10.1093/bioinformatics/btl365,SEP 1 2006,34,"Motivation: The identification of signatures of positive selection can provide important insights into recent evolutionary history in human populations. Current methods mostly rely on allele frequency determination or focus on one or a small number of candidate chromosomal regions per study. With the availability of large-scale genotype data, efficient approaches for an unbiased whole genome scan are becoming necessary.

Methods: We have developed a new method, the whole genome long-range haplotype test (WGLRH), which uses genome-wide distributions to test for recent positive selection. Adapted from the long-range haplotype (LRH) test, the WGLRH test uses patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) to identify regions with extremely low historic recombination. Common haplotypes with significantly longer than expected rangesof LD given theirfrequencies are identified as putative signatures of recent positive selection. In addition, we have also determined the ancestral alleles of SNIPs by genotyping chimpanzee and gorilla DNA, and have identified SNPswherethe non-ancestral alleles have risento extremely high frequencies in human populations, termed 'flipped SNPs'. Combining the haplotype test and the flipped SNPs determination, the WGLRH test serves as an unbiased genome-wide screen for regions under putative selection, and is potentially applicable to the study of other human populations.

Results: Using WGLRH and high-density oligonucleotide arrays interrogating 116 204 SNPs, we rapidly identified putative regions of positive selection in three populations (Asian, Caucasian, AfricanAmerican), and extended these observations to a fourth population, Yoruba, with data obtained from the International HapMap consortium. We mapped significant regionsto annotated genes. While some regions overlap with genes previously suggested to be under positive selection, many of the genes have not been previously implicated in natural selection and offer intriguing possibilities for further study.

Nucleotide variation and haplotype diversity in a 10-kb noncoding region in three continental human populations,"['Zhao, ZM', 'Yu, N', 'Fu, YX', 'Li, WH']",GENETICS,10.1534/genetics.106.060301,SEP 2006,18,"Noncoding regions are usually less subject to natural selection than coding regions and so may be more useful for studying human evolution. The recent surveys of worldwide DNA variation in four 10-kb noncoding regions revealed many interesting but also some incongruent patterns. Here we studied another 10-kb noncoding region, which is in 6p22. Sixty-six single-nucleotide polymorphisms were found among the 122 worldwide human sequences, resulting in 46 genotypes, from which 48 haplotypes were inferred. The distribution patterns of DNA variation, genotypes, and haplotypes suggest rapid population expansion in relatively recent times. The levels of polymorphism within human populations and divergence between humans and chimpanzees at this locus were generally similar to those for the other four noncoding regions. Fu and Li's tests rejected the neutrality assumption in the total sample and in the African sample but Tajima's test did not reject neutrality. A detailed examination of the contributions of various types of mutations to the parameters used in the neutrality tests clarified the discrepancy between these test results. The age estimates suggest a relatively young history in this region. Combining three autosomal noncoding regions, we estimated the long-term effective population size of humans to be 11,000 2800 using Tajima's estimator and 17,600 4700 using Watterson's estimator and the age of the most recent common ancestor to be 860,000 258,000 years ago."
"Evidence for involvement of TRE-2 (USP6) oncogene, low-copy repeat and acrocentric heterochromatin in two families with chromosomal translocations","['Ou, ZS', 'Jarmuz, M', 'Sparagana, SP', 'Michaud, J', 'Decarie, JC', 'Yatsenko, SA', 'Nowakowska, B', 'Furman, P', 'Shaw, CA', 'Shaffer, LG', 'Lupski, JR', 'Chinault, AC', 'Cheung, SW', 'Stankiewicz, P']",HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s00439-006-0200-7,SEP 2006,3,"We report clinical findings and molecular cytogenetic analyses for two patients with translocations [t(14;17)(p12;p12) and t(15;17)(p12;p13.2)], in which the chromosome 17 breakpoints map at a large low-copy repeat (LCR) and a breakage-prone TRE-2 (USP6) oncogene, respectively. In family 1, a 6-year-old girl and her 5-year-old brother were diagnosed with mental retardation, short stature, dysmorphic features, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). G-banding chromosome analysis showed a der(14)t(14;17)(p12;p12) in both siblings, inherited from their father, a carrier of the balanced translocation. Chromosome microarray and FISH analyses revealed that the PMP22 gene was duplicated. The chromosome 17 breakpoint was mapped within an similar to 383 kb LCR17pA that is known to also be the site of several breakpoints of different chromosome aberrations including the evolutionary translocation t(4;19) in Gorilla gorilla. In family two, a patient with developmental delay, subtle dysmorphic features, ventricular enlargement with decreased periventricular white matter, mild findings of bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria and a very small anterior commissure, a cryptic duplication including the Miller-Dieker syndrome region was identified by chromosome microarray analysis. The chromosome 17 breakpoint was mapped by FISH at the TRE-2 oncogene. Both partner chromosome breakpoints were mapped on the short arm acrocentric heterochromatin within or distal to the rRNA cluster, distal to the region commonly rearranged in Robertsonian translocations. We propose that TRE-2 together with LCR17pA, located similar to 10 Mb apart, also generated the evolutionary gorilla translocation t(4;19). Our results support previous observations that the USP6 oncogene, LCRs, and repetitive DNA sequences play a significant role in the origin of constitutional chromosome aberrations and primate genome evolution."
Evolution of an intronic microsatellite polymorphism in Toll-like receptor 2 among primates,"['Yim, JJ', 'Adams, AA', 'Kim, JH', 'Holland, SM']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s00251-006-0141-2,SEP 2006,5,"Nonhuman primates express varying responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis: New World monkeys appear to be resistant to tuberculosis (TB) while Old World monkeys seem to be particularly susceptible. The aim of this study was to elucidate the presence of the regulatory guanine-thymine (GT) repeat polymorphisms in intron 2 of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) associated with the development of TB in humans and to determine any variations in these microsatellite polymorphisms in primates. We sequenced the region encompassing the regulatory GT repeat microsatellites in intron 2 of TLR2 in 12 different nonhuman primates using polymerase chain reaction amplification, TA cloning, and automatic sequencing. The nonhuman primates included for this study were as follows: chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), bonobo (Pan paniscus), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), Celebes ape (Macaca nigra), rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), pigtail macaque (Macaca nemestrina), patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas), spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), Woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagotricha), tamarin (Saguinus labiatus), and ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta). Nucleotide sequences encompassing the regulatory GT repeat region are similar across species and are completely conserved in great apes. However, Old World monkeys lack GT repeats altogether, while New World monkeys and ring-tailed lemurs have much more complex structures around the position of the repeats. In conclusion, the genetic structures encompassing the regulatory GT repeats in intron 2 of human TLR2 are similar among nonhuman primates. The sequence is most conserved in New World monkeys and less in Old World monkeys."
Energy-based swing-back control for continuous brachiation of a multilocomotion robot,"['Kajima, H', 'Hasegawa, Y', 'Doi, M', 'Fukuda, T']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS,10.1002/int.20174,SEP 2006,6,"We propose an energy-based control method for a multilocomotion robot to improve the stability of continuous brachiation. The target continuous brachiation is an effective locomotion from one bar to another exchanging a kinetic energy with potential energy like a pendulum. Our control strategy for the continuous brachiation is to control the swing-back action so that the robot pumps up the feasible energy to grasp a target bar, and then the locomotion action is designed based on the symmetric motion of a pendulum in order to conserve the total energy: summation of the kinetic and potential energy. The proposed controller is implemented on a new type of mobile multilocomotion robot named ""Gorilla Robot III"" whose dimensions are mimicking those of a gorilla. Continuous brachiation on various uniform ladders is experimentally achieved with this robot. The experimental results show the validity of our control algorithm. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Size and shape variation in Australopithecus afarensis proximal femora,"['Harmon, EH']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.01.009,SEP 2006,17,"The degree of size and shape variation in the A. afarensis fossil sample has been interpreted in a variety of ways. Size variation has been described as exceeding that of extant hominoids, similar to that of strongly sexually dimorphic hominoids, and best matched to modem humans. The degree of shape variation has been characterized both as great and negligible. Recent fieldwork has increased the proximal femora] sample, providing new data with which to examine variation. The proximal femur of A. afarensis is analyzed in a comparative framework in order to gauge the magnitude of size and shape variation in this element.

Seven of the best-preserved A. aprensis proximal femora contribute to the analysis (A.L. 128-1, A.L. 152-2, A.L. 211-1, A.L. 288-lap, A.L. 333-3, A.L. 333-123, A.L. 827-1). Comparative samples from Pan, Pongo, Gorilla, and Homo provide context for interpreting variation among the fossils. The coefficient of variation (CV) of linear measurements is used to estimate size variation. Bootstrap resampling of CVs from extant hominoids provides distributions for comparison to A. afarensis CVs. Ratios of linear measurements provide scale-free shape variables that are used in pairwise comparisons. The Euclidean distance between pairs of A. afarensis are compared to the Euclidean distances between extant hominoid pairs.

As found in some earlier analyses, size variation in A. afarensis is accommodated best in gorillas and orangutans. The magnitude of difference in shape between A. afarensis pairs is exceeded by most taxa, indicating that shape variation is not extreme. These general findings are contradicted by a few instances of excessive size and shape variation. These are uncharacteristic results and could point to temporal bias, although other alternatives are explored. The signal from the proximal femur is that size variation in A. afarensis is like that of the strongly sexually dimorphic apes, and shape variation is well within the range of most hominoids irrespective of their degree of size dimorphism.

Molar microwear in Praeanthropus afarensis: Evidence for dietary stasis through time and under diverse paleoecological conditions,"['Grine, FE', 'Ungar, PS', 'Teaford, MF', 'El-Zaatari, S', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.04.004,SEP 2006,70,"Molar microwear fabrics in extant mammals vary with diet and, more particularly, the physical properties of the items that are consumed. Praeanthropus afarensis is well represented in the fossil record over a prolonged and radiometrically controlled temporal span, and reasonably robust paleoecological reconstructions are available for the various localities from which it is known. We therefore examined molar microwear in this species to determine whether diet varied in relation to time or in response to different ecological conditions. Of more than 70 specimens of Pr. afarensis that contain one or more worn permanent molars, only 19 were found to be suitable for microwear analysis. These derive from eight temporal horizons in the Laetolil Beds and Hadar Formation spanning approximately 400 kyr (3.6-3.2 Ma). Six paleoecological categories have been reconstructed for these horizons, and these were ranked on the basis of floral cover. None of the microwear variables observed for Pr. afarensis is significantly associated with either temporal or paleoecological rank. Thus, microwear and, by extension, diet does not appear to have altered significantly in Pr. afarensis through time or in response to different paleoecological circumstances. The wear pattern that appears to have characterized Pr. afarensis overlaps extensively that of Gorilla gorilla beringei and differs notably from the fabrics of extant primates (e.g., Cebus apella and Cercocebus albigena) that consume hard objects. The high proportion of scratches on Pr. afarensis molars suggests the inclusion of fine abrasives in or on the food items consumed by those individuals sampled in this study. Although Pr. afarensis may have been morphologically equipped to process hard, brittle items, the microwear data suggest that it did not necessarily do so, even in the face of varying environmental circumstances. Explanatory scenarios that describe Pr. afarensis as part of an evolutionary trajectory involving a more heavily masticated diet with an increased reliance on hard, brittle items need to be reconsidered. However, fallback foods that were consumed during relatively short, albeit critical periods may have exerted sufficient selective pressure to explain the evolution of the comparatively robust Pr. afarensis trophic apparatus. Because it is unlikely that many individuals from such restricted temporal intervals would be sampled in the paleontological record, we suggest that the most productive approach to the elucidation of paleodiet is the integration of genetic (morphological) and epigenetic (microwear and isotopic) lines of evidence.

Cholesterol values in free-ranging gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei) and Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus),"['Schmidt, DA', 'Ellersieck, MR', 'Cranfield, MR', 'Karesh, WB']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/05-040.1,SEP 2006,8,"Cholesterol concentrations in captive gorillas and orangutans vary widely within species and average approximately 244 mg/dI for gorillas and 169 mg/dI for orangutans as published previously. The International Species Inventory System reports higher concentrations of 275 and 199 mg/dI for gorillas and orangutans, respectively. It is unknown whether these values were typical, influenced by captive management, or both. To answer this question, banked serum samples from free-ranging mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei), western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) were analyzed for total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Mountain gorillas did not differ significantly from free-ranging western lowland gorillas in cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, indicating mountain gorilla values could be a model for western lowland gorillas. Captive gorilla total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in free-ranging groups. Triglyceride concentrations for captive gorillas were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the male mountain and western lowland gorillas, but they were not significantly different from the female mountain gorillas. Captive orangutan total cholesterol concentrations were only higher (P < 0.05) than the free-ranging female orangutans, whereas captive orangutan low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than both free-ranging male and female orangutans. Calculated and measured low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were compared for all free-ranging animals and were significantly different (P < 0.05) for all groups, indicating Friedewald's equation for calculating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is not appropriate for use with nonfasted apes. The higher total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in captive apes may predispose them to cardiovascular disease and might be attributed to diets, limited energy expenditure, and genetics."
Identification of the ancestral killer immunoglobulin-like receptor gene in primates,"['Sambrook, JG', 'Bashirova, A', 'Andersen, H', 'Piatak, M', 'Vernikos, GS', 'Coggill, P', 'Lifson, JD', 'Carrington, M', 'Beck, S']",BMC GENOMICS,10.1186/1471-2164-7-209,AUG 15 2006,35,"Background: Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR) are essential immuno- surveillance molecules. They are expressed on natural killer and T cells, and interact with human leukocyte antigens. KIR genes are highly polymorphic and contribute vital variability to our immune system. Numerous KIR genes, belonging to five distinct lineages, have been identified in all primates examined thus far and shown to be rapidly evolving. Since few KIR remain orthologous between species, with only one of them, KIR2DL4, shown to be common to human, apes and monkeys, the evolution of the KIR gene family in primates remains unclear.

Results: Using comparative analyses, we have identified the ancestral KIR lineage ( provisionally named KIR3DL0) in primates. We show KIR3DL0 to be highly conserved with the identification of orthologues in human ( Homo sapiens), common chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes), gorilla ( Gorilla gorilla), rhesus monkey ( Macaca mulatta) and common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus). We predict KIR3DL0 to encode a functional molecule in all primates by demonstrating expression in human, chimpanzee and rhesus monkey. Using the rhesus monkey as a model, we further show the expression profile to be typical of KIR by quantitative measurement of KIR3DL0 from an enriched population of natural killer cells.

Conclusion: One reason why KIR3DL0 may have escaped discovery for so long is that, in human, it maps in between two related leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor clusters outside the known KIR gene cluster on Chromosome 19. Based on genomic, cDNA, expression and phylogenetic data, we report a novel lineage of immunoglobulin receptors belonging to the KIR family, which is highly conserved throughout 50 million years of primate evolution."
Adaptive selection of mitochondrial complex I subunits during primate radiation,"['Mishmar, D', 'Ruiz-Pesini, E', 'Mondragon-Palomino, M', 'Procaccio, V', 'Gaut, B', 'Wallace, DC']",GENE,10.1016/j.gene.2006.03.015,AUG 15 2006,46,"Mammalian oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV and V are assembled from both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) encoded subunits, with complex I encompassing 39 nDNA and seven mtDNA subunits. Yet the sequence variation of the mtDNA genes is more than ten fold greater than that of the nDNA encoded genes of the OXPHOS complexes and the mtDNA proteins have been found to be influenced by positive (adaptive) selection. To maintain a functional complex I, nDNA and mtDNA subunits must interact, implying that certain nDNA complex I genes may also have been influenced by positive selection. To determine if positive selection has influenced nDNA complex I genes, we analyzed the DNA sequences of all of the nDNA and mtDNA encoded complex I subunits from orangutan, gorilla, chimpanzee, human and all available vertebrate sequences. This revealed that three nDNA complex I genes (NDUFC2, NDUFA1, and NDUFA4) had significantly increased amino acid substitution rates by both PAML and Z-test, suggesting that they have been subjected to adaptive selection during primate radiation. Since all three of these subunits reside in the membrane domain of complex I along with the mtDNA subunits, we compared amino acid changes in these three nDNA genes with those of the mtDNA genes across species. Changes in the nDNA NDUFC2 cysteine 39 were found to correlate with those in the mtDNA ND5 cysteine 330. Therefore, adaptive selection has influenced some nDNA complex I genes and nDNA and mtDNA complex I genes may have co-evolved. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Using the PC-matched control (MC) method, PC behavior was examined in two groups (n = 13) of captive western lowland gorillas, a species for which no conflict resolution data have been published. Analyses of 223 conflicts showed significantly more affiliation between former opponents after a conflict when compared to control periods, indicating reconciliation. Results also showed significantly more affiliation between the victim and a third-party after a conflict, indicating consolation. Both solicited and unsolicited consolation were observed. The majority of the affiliative interactions observed for both reconciliation and consolation were social proximity, which suggests that unlike most nonhuman primates, proximity, rather than physical contact, may be the main mechanism for resolving conflicts in western lowland gorillas. PC behavior was not uniform throughout the groups, but rather varied according to dyad type."
Pathogens as drivers of population declines: The importance of systematic monitoring in great apes and other threatened mammals,"['Leendertz, FH', 'Pauli, G', 'Maetz-Rensing, K', 'Boardman, W', 'Nunn, C', 'Ellerbrok, H', 'Jensen, SA', 'Junglen, S', 'Boesch, C']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2006.05.002,AUG 2006,101,"Until recently, the focus of great ape behavioural and ecological research has been distinct from the focus of scientists working in medical and veterinary sciences. More scientists are calling for a connection between medical and field research due to recent disease outbreaks in great apes, including Ebola, and indications of cross-transmission of Ebola and other viruses between primates and humans. A major limitation to progress is the lack of information on infectious diseases and their transmission in wild primates. Here, we present examples of successful pathogen detection in wild great apes and describe approaches and techniques that can be used in the field, focusing in particular on investigation of deaths and non-invasive sample collection. This interdisciplinary approach is providing new insights to infectious diseases of great apes and is helping to protect the health of great ape populations. This framework can also be applied to other mammals under threat from infectious diseases, including African wild dogs, seals and Tasmanian devils. In addition to providing benefits for great ape conservation, research that integrates infectious disease with primate ecology provides insights to emerging diseases in humans and the role of disease in primate evolution.

Density-based load estimation using two-dimensional finite element models: a parametric study.,"['Bona, Max A', 'Martin, Larry D', 'Fischer, Kenneth J']",Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering,10.1080/10255840600792451,2006-Aug,3,"A parametric investigation was conducted to determine the effects on the load estimation method of varying: (1) the thickness of back-plates used in the two-dimensional finite element models of long bones, (2) the number of columns of nodes in the outer medial and lateral sections of the diaphysis to which the back-plate multipoint constraints are applied and (3) the region of bone used in the optimization procedure of the density-based load estimation technique. The study is performed using two-dimensional finite element models of the proximal femora of a chimpanzee, gorilla, lion and grizzly bear. It is shown that the density-based load estimation can be made more efficient and accurate by restricting the stimulus optimization region to the metaphysis/epiphysis. In addition, a simple method, based on the variation of diaphyseal cortical thickness, is developed for assigning the thickness to the back-plate. It is also shown that the number of columns of nodes used as multipoint constraints does not have a significant effect on the method."
Impacts of roads and hunting on central African rainforest mammals,"['Laurance, WF', 'Croes, BM', 'Tchignoumba, L', 'Lahm, SA', 'Alonso, A', 'Lee, ME', 'Campbell, P', 'Ondzeano, C']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00420.x,AUG 2006,124,"Road expansion and associated increases in hunting pressure are a rapidly growing threat to African tropical wildlife. In the rainforests of southern Gabon, we compared abundances of larger (> 1 kg) mammal species at varying distances from forest roads and between hunted and unhunted treatments (comparing a 130-km(2) oil concession that was almost entirely protected from hunting with nearby areas outside the concession that had moderate hunting pressure). At each of 12 study sites that were evenly divided between hunted and unhunted areas, we established standardized 1-km transects at five distances (50, 300, 600, 900, and 1200 m) from an unpaved road, and then repeatedly surveyed mammals during the 2004 dry and wet seasons. Hunting had the greatest impact on duikers (Cephalophus spp.), forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), and red river bogs (Potamochoerus porcus), which declined in abundance outside the oil concession, and lesser effects on lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and carnivores. Roads depressed abundances of duikers, sitatungas (Tragelaphus spekei gratus), and forest elephants (Loxondonta africana cyclotis), with avoidance of roads being stronger outside than inside the concession. Five monkey species showed little response to roads or hunting, whereas some rodents and pangolins increased in abundance outside the concession, possibly in response to greater forest disturbance. Our findings suggest that even moderate hunting pressure can markedly alter the structure of mammal communities in central Africa. Roads had the greatest impacts on large and small ungulates, with the magnitude of road avoidance increasing with local bunting pressure."
Nature of allelic sequence polymorphism at the KIR3DL3 locus,"['Jones, DC', 'Hiby, SE', 'Moffett, A', 'Trowsdale, J', 'Young, NT']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s00251-006-0130-5,AUG 2006,14,"KIR3DL3 is a framework gene of the Leukocyte Receptor Complex, present in all individuals and haplotypes analysed to date. We describe 17 novel KIR3DL3 alleles, including seven single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) positions within the coding region. Sequence variation within introns included a VNTR within intron 1. As KIR3DL3 mRNA is known to be expressed in decidual NK cells, we investigated the impact of KIR3DL3 allelic variation on pre-eclampsia. No statistical difference in allele frequency or polymorphism was observed between pre-eclampsia patient and control cohorts. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis of exonic SNPs suggested that recombination may be a mechanism of generating sequence diversity within KIR3DL3. A potential recombination hotspot was located within intron 5. A strong LD was detected between polymorphism in exon 6 of KIR3DL3 and the KIR gene -2DL3 or -2DS2 loci, which define the centromeric end of two main haplotypes (A and B) of the KIR cluster. Comparison of primate KIR sequences indicated that the Ig domains of KIR3DL3 are highly conserved between chimpanzee, gorilla and humans. Investigation of KIR3DL3 dN/dS ratios indicated a greater level of synonymous mutations consistent with purifying selection, although positive selection was detected acting on two sites within the stem region."
Noninvasive assessment of gastrointestinal parasite infections in free-ranging primates,"['Gillespie, TR']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-006-9064-x,AUG 2006,59,"Recent evidence of emerging human diseases with origins or likely transmission to humans, or both, that involve primates and a greater recognition of the risk of human pathogen transmission to free-ranging primates have raised awareness of the potential impact of zoonotic pathogen transmission on primate conservation and nonhuman primate and human health. As human population density continues to increase exponentially, speeding the reduction and fragmentation of primate habitats, greater human-primate contact is inevitable and even higher rates of pathogen transmission are likely. Thus interest has grown in collecting baseline data on patterns of parasitic infections in wild primate populations to provide an index of population health and to begin to assess and, to manage disease risks. Primatologists traditionally have been involved with such surveys through noninvasive assessment of gastrointestinal parasites. Unfortunately, previous studies have tended toward divergent methodologies, compromising the potential for longitudinal and comparative work. Here, I provide practical guidelines and standardized methodologies for the noninvasive assessment of gastrointestinal parasites of primates."
"A faithful record of stressful life events preserved in the dental developmental record of a juvenile Gorilla

Much recent research has focused on dental development in chimpanzees and other hominoids, but comparatively little is known about dental development in Gorilla. To date, dental chronologies for Gorilla are based on a sample of 1 and information about variations in the time and timing of crown initiation and completion is lacking. We provide data on dental development in 1 captive, juvenile, female, western lowland Gorilla gorilla gorilla of known age, sex, life events, and date of death (carefully documented as part of zoo records) that experienced various physical insults during her first year of life. The perfect natural experiment allowed us to test the association of the timing of accentuated stress lines in teeth with significant physiological and psychological events during ontogeny of this juvenile gorilla. We analyzed histological sections from 14 permanent teeth (maxillary and mandibular I1-M2) and assessed crown initiation (CI) and crown formation times (CFT) using short- and long-period incremental lines in both enamel and dentine; they are advanced for all teeth compared to previously published chronology. The data suggest a relatively accelerated pace of dental development in gorillas compared to chimpanzees and fit an emerging pattern of an accelerated life history schedule in gorillas. Data on the timing of major accentuated lines in the developing dentition are tightly associated with exact dates of surgical procedures and follow-up hospital visits as recorded on zoo medical records. Our data highlight the importance of captive individuals with well-documented medical records for studying life history."
Inertial properties of hominoid limb segments,"['Isler, K', 'Payne, RC', 'Gunther, MM', 'Thorpe, SKS', 'Li, Y', 'Savage, R', 'Crompton, RH']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2006.00588.x,AUG 2006,19,"Quantitative, accurate data regarding the inertial properties of body segments are of paramount importance when developing musculo-skeletal locomotor models of living animals and, by inference, their ancestors.

With additional data from external measurements of eight more hominoid cadavers, and published data, intergeneric differences between the inertial properties and the distribution of mass between limb segments are analysed and related to the locomotor habits of the species. We found that segment inertial properties show extensive overlap between ape genera as a result of large interindividual variation. Segment mass distribution also overlaps between apes and humans, with the exception of the shank segment. However, owing to a different distribution of mass between the limb segments, the centre of mass of both the arms and the legs is located more distally in apes than in humans, and the natural pendular period of ape forelimbs is larger than that of the hindlimbs. This suggests that, in contrast to the limbs of cursorial mammals and cercopithecoid primates, hominoid limbs are not optimized for efficiency in quadrupedal walking, but rather reflect a compromise between various locomotor modes.

Characterization of Bacillus anthracis-like bacteria isolated from wild great apes from Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon,"['Klee, SR', 'Ozel, M', 'Appel, B', 'Boesch, C', 'Ellerbrok, H', 'Jacob, D', 'Holland, G', 'Leendertz, FH', 'Pauli, G', 'Grunow, R', 'Nattermann, H']",JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY,10.1128/JB.00303-06,AUG 2006,65,"We present the microbiological and molecular characterization of bacteria isolated from four chimpanzees and one gorilla thought to have died of an anthrax-like disease in Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon. These isolates differed significantly from classic Bacillus anthracis by the following criteria: motility, resistance to the gamma phage, and, for isolates from Cameroon, resistance to penicillin G. A capsule was expressed not only after induction by CO, and bicarbonate but also under normal growth conditions. Subcultivation resulted in beta-hemolytic activity and gamma phage susceptibility in some subclones, suggesting differences in gene regulation compared to classic B. anthracis. The isolates from Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon showed slight differences in their biochemical characteristics and MICs of different antibiotics but were identical in all molecular features and sequences analyzed. PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed the presence of both the toxin and the capsule plasmid, with sizes corresponding to the B. anthracis virulence plasmids pXO1 and pXO2. Protective antigen was expressed and secreted into the culture supernatant. The isolates possessed variants of the Ba813 marker and the SG-749 fragment differing from that of classic B. anthracis strains. Multilocus sequence typing revealed a close relationship of our atypical isolates with both classic B. anthracis strains and two uncommonly virulent Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. We propose that the newly discovered atypical B. anthracis strains share a common ancestor with classic B. anthracis or that they emerged recently by transfer of the B. anthracis plasmids to a strain of the B. cereus group."
Contours of the hominoid lateral tibial condyle with implications for Australopithecus,"['Organ, JM', 'Ward, CV']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.01.007,AUG 2006,23,"Tibial condyle shape is alleged to vary among fossil tibiae attributed to Australopithecus, and has been argued to reflect functional differences of the knee. Convex anteroposterior curvature of the lateral tibial condyle in A. africanus has been interpreted to indicate a more chimpanzee-like locomotor repertoire than the flatter lateral tibial condyles of A. afarensis (Berger and Tobias, 1996, J. Hum. Evol. 30, 343). Alternatively, Latimer, Ohman, and Lovejoy (1987, Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 74, 155) have suggested that in response to increased transarticular loads accompanied by larger body mass, joints should become flatter as size increases, both within and among species, so that the variation observed among hominin fossils reflects size alone rather than functional differences. In this study, three-dimensional surface areas of the lateral tibial condyle of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas were computed using a Digibot 11 (Digibotics) laser scanner and the DataSculpt v.4.6 engineering software package to evaluate joint surface contours, and compared to two-dimensional surface area and arc and chord length measurements of the anteroposterior and mediolateral axes. Extant species measurements were then compared to those of A. afarensis (A.L. 129-1b, A.L. 288-laq, A.L. 333x-26, A.L. 333-42) and A. africanus (Stw 514a). Results do not support the hypothesis that A. afarensis and A. africanus differ in condylar topology. They also do not support the hypothesis that joint surfaces become flatter with increased transarticular load accompanying increased body size, as curvature of the lateral tibial condyle in anteroposterior and mediolateral planes is not negatively allometric. However, femoral condylar shape is not included in this study, which may better reflect joint surface responses to increased body size. Finally, there is no basis from this study to reconstruct differences in locomotor behavior among fossil hominin taxa based on lateral tibial condyle morphology. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Philopatry and reproductive success in Bornean orang-utans (Pongo pygmaeus),"['Goossens, B', 'Setchell, JM', 'James, SS', 'Funk, SM', 'Chikhi, L', 'Abulani, A', 'Ancrenaz, M', 'Lackman-Ancrenaz, I', 'Bruford, MW']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.02952.x,AUG 2006,35,"Behavioural observations suggest that orang-utans are semi-solitary animals with females being philopatric and males roaming more widely in search of receptive partners, leading to the prediction that females are more closely related than males at any given site. In contrast, our study presents evidence for male and female philopatry in the orang-utan. We examined patterns of relatedness and parentage in a wild orang-utan population in Borneo using noninvasively collected DNA samples from animals observed to defecate, and microsatellite markers to assess dispersal and mating strategies. Surprisingly, resident females were equally as related to other resident females (mean r(xy) = 0.303) as resident males were to other resident males (mean r(xy) = 0.305). Moreover, resident females were more related to each other and to the resident males than they were to nonresident females, and resident males were more related to each other (and resident females) than they were to nonresident males. We assigned genetic mothers to 12 individuals in the population, while sires could be identified for eight. Both flanged males and unflanged males achieved paternity, similar to findings reported for Sumatran orang-utans."

The goal of the study was to assess the amounts of fiber, protein, and sugars in the foods eaten by the Bwindi gorillas, and to determine whether condensed tannins and cyanide are present in these foods. A total of 127 food plant parts representing 84 plant species eaten by two groups of Bwindi gorillas were collected, processed, and analyzed for their chemical contents. The Bwindi gorilla ate foods that contain 2-28% crude protein (CP), 21-88% neutral detergent fiber (NDF), 14-60% acid detergent fiber (ADF), 2-42% acid detergent lignin (ADL), and <= 1-50% water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) on a dry matter (DM) basis. Moisture in these foods ranged from 7% to 96%. Approximately 35% of the foods analyzed contained condensed tannins, and two foods contained cyanogenic glycosides. This is the first detailed report regarding the nutritional chemistry of gorilla foods in Bwindi, many of which are also eaten by other primates. This unique data set adds to our knowledge about the nutritional composition of foods eaten by gorillas across habitats, is useful for understanding aspects of feeding behavior, and provides valuable comparative data for optimizing the diets of gorillas ex situ."
Bed-building in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): The importance of early rearing,"['Videan, EN']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20265,JUL 2006,11,"In the wild, great apes sleep in beds they make by successively bending branches into an interwoven platform. These beds are functionally more closely related to human beds than they are to the nests and tree-holes used by other primate species. The idea that bed-building by great apes is learned behavior that is dependent on appropriate early experiences has been proposed but never fully tested. In the present study this hypothesis was indirectly tested in 73 captive adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes; 27 wild-born and 46 captive-born). Bed-building and use were tested experimentally by the introduction of three sets of bedding materials. Over 200 hr of scan-sampling data were collected during 45-min observations following introduction of the bedding material. The wild-born subjects built and used beds significantly more often than the captive-born subjects. Also, wild-born subjects used more complex techniques during construction. Captive-born subjects that were mother-reared through early adolescence spent more time building and using beds than their nursery-reared counterparts. These differences remained consistent even when previous adult experience with bedding (measured as naturalistic vs. traditional housing) was accounted for. These results suggest that bed-building is a learned behavior that requires early experience and practice for acquisition."
How great apes perform on a modified trap-tube task,"['Mulcahy, NJ', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-006-0019-6,JUL 2006,58,"To date, neither primates nor birds have shown clear evidence of causal knowledge when attempting to solve the trap tube task. One factor that may have contributed to mask the knowledge that subjects may have about the task is that subjects were only allowed to push the reward away from them, which is a particularly difficult action for primates in certain problem solving situations. We presented five orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), two chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), two bonobos (Pan paniscus), and one gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) with a modified trap tube that allowed subjects to push or rake the reward with the tool. In two additional follow-up tests, we inverted the tube 180 degrees rendering the trap nonfunctional and also presented subjects with the original task in which they were required to push the reward out of the tube. Results showed that all but one of the subjects preferred to rake the reward. Two orangutans and one chimpanzee (all of whom preferred to rake the reward), consistently avoided the trap only when it was functional but failed the original task. These findings suggest that some great apes may have some causal knowledge about the trap-tube task. Their success, however, depended on whether they were allowed to choose certain tool-using actions."

Objects were placed under I or 2 of 3 cups by visible or invisible displacements. The series included 6 tasks: delayed response, inhibition test, A not B, rotations, transpositions, and object permanence. Apes and children solved most tasks performing at comparable levels except in the transposition task, in which apes performed better than children. Ape species performed at comparable levels in all tasks except in single transpositions, in which chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) performed better than gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and orangutans (Pongo pygmeatis). All species found nonadjacent trials and rotations especially difficult. The number of elements that changed locations, the type of displacement, and having to inhibit predominant reaching responses were factors that negatively affected the subjects' performance."
SSADH variation in primates: Intra- and interspecific data on a gene with a potential role in human cognitive functions,"['Blasi, P', 'Palmerio, F', 'Aiello, A', 'Rocchi, M', 'Malaspina, P', 'Novelletto, A']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-005-0154-8,JUL 2006,7,"In the present study we focus on the nucleotide and the inferred amino acid variation occurring in humans and other primate species for mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, a gene recently supposed to contribute to cognitive performance in humans. We determined 2527 bp of coding, intronic, and flanking sequences from chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, and macaque. We also resequenced the entire coding sequence on 39 independent chromosomes from Italian families. Four variable coding sites were genotyped in additional populations from Europe, Africa, and Asia. A test for constancy of the nonsynonymous vs. synonymous rates of nucleotide changes revealed that primates are characterized by largely variable d(N)/d(S) ratios. On a background of strong conservation, probably controlled by selective constraints, the lineage leading to humans showed a ratio increased to 0.42. Human polymorphic levels fall in the range reported for other genes, with a pattern of frequency and haplotype structure strongly suggestive of nonneutrality. The comparison with the primate sequences allowed inferring the ancestral state at all variable positions, suggesting that the c.538(C) allele and the associated functional variant is indeed a derived state that is proceeding to fixation. The unexpected pattern of human polymorphism compared to interspecific findings outlines the possibility of a recent positive selection on some variants relevant to new cognitive capabilities unique to humans."
Dietary characterization of the hominoid Khoratpithecus (Miocene of Thailand): evidence from dental topographic and microwear texture analyses,"['Merceron, G', 'Taylor, S', 'Scott, R', 'Chaimanee, Y', 'Jaeger, JJ']",NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN,10.1007/s00114-006-0107-0,JUL 2006,22,"The genus Khoratpithecus, a hominoid thought to be related to the orangutan lineage, is represented by two known fossil species K. chiangmuanensis and K. piriyai. Both were discovered in Southeast Asia (Thailand) and are dated to the Middle and Late Miocene, respectively. In this study, dental topographic and microwear texture analyses were used to examine molars from both of these species, with the goal of understanding their dietary preferences. Although sample sizes are small for Khoratpithecus, available data are compared to that collected for extant apes. Environmental evidence, such as botanical remains and sedimentological data, is also considered for comparisons with dietary reconstruction. Results from dental topographic analysis suggest that the two fossil species were better adapted to a diet of fruits than to one of leaves, much like the living orangutan or chimpanzee. Results from microwear texture analysis further support this, suggesting that Khoratpithecus preferred soft fruits to hard fruits or seeds. And finally, the botanical and sedimentological evidence point to environments for Khoratpithecus that would have been compatible with a fruit-eating species. Given the small sample sizes available for analysis, however, definitive judgments are not yet possible at this time."
A new mark test for mirror self-recognition in non-human primates,"['Heschl, A', 'Burkart, J']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-005-0170-8,JUL 2006,9,"For 30 years Gallup's (Science 167:86-87, 1970) mark test, which consists of confronting a mirror-experienced test animal with its own previously altered mirror image, usually a color mark on forehead, eyebrow or ear, has delivered valuable results about the distribution of visual self-recognition in non-human primates. Chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans and, less frequently, gorillas can learn to correctly understand the reflection of their body in a mirror. However, the standard version of the mark test is good only for positively proving the existence of self-recognition. Conclusive statements about the lack of self-recognition are more difficult because of the methodological constraints of the test. This situation has led to a persistent controversy about the power of Gallup's original technique. We devised a new variant of the test which permits more unequivocal decisions about both the presence and absence of self-recognition. This new procedure was tested with marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus), following extensive training with mirror-related tasks to facilitate performance in the standard mark test. The results show that a slightly altered mark test with a new marking substance (chocolate cream) can help to reliably discriminate between true negative results, indicating a real lack of ability to recognize oneself in a mirror, from false negative results that are due to methodological particularities of the standard test. Finally, an evolutionary hypothesis is put forward as to why many primates can use a mirror instrumentally - i.e. know how to use it for grasping at hidden objects - while failing in the decisive mark test."
Captive female gorilla agonistic relationships with clumped defendable food resources,"['Scott, J', 'Lockard, JS']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-005-0167-3,JUL 2006,10,"Minimal feeding competition among female mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) has resulted in egalitarian social relationships with poorly defined agonistic dominance hierarchies. Thus, gorillas are generally viewed as non-competitive egalitarian folivores that have had little need to develop effective competitive strategies to access food resources. However, this generalization is inconsistent with more recent research indicating that most gorillas are frugivorous, feeding on patchily distributed food resources. The current study at Howletts Wild Animal Park, Kent, England, explores the effects of clumped and defendable foods on female gorilla agonistic relationships among three groups of western lowland gorillas (G. g. gorilla), conditions that are predicted to lead to well-differentiated agonistic dominance hierarchies among female primates. The Howletts gorillas foraged all day on low-energy/-nutrient, high-fiber foods widely distributed around their enclosure by the keepers. However, they also had periodic access to high-energy foods (e.g., nuts, raisins, strawberries, etc.) that the keepers would spread in a clumped and defendable patch. Frequencies of agonistic and submissive behaviors between females and proximity data were gathered. High-status females were found to monopolize the food patch and kept the low-status females at bay with cough-grunt threat vocalizations or by chasing them away. Agonistic interactions were initiated mostly by females of high status; these were directed towards females of low status and were generally not reciprocal. In addition, females of low status engaged in submissive behaviors the most often, which they directed primarily at females of high status, especially in response to aggression by the latter. Agonistic interactions between high- and low-status females had decided outcomes more often than not, with low-status females the losers. Competition over highly desirable foods distributed in defendable clumps at Howletts appears to have led to well-defined dominance relationships among these female gorillas."
Comparison of androgen receptor CAG and GGN repeat length polymorphism in humans and apes,"['Hong, KW', 'Hibino, E', 'Takenaka, O', 'Hayasaka, I', 'Murayama, Y', 'Ito, S', 'Inoue-Murayama, M']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-005-0174-4,JUL 2006,11,"Two polymorphic trinucleotide repeats of human androgen receptor gene (hAR), CAG and GGN which encode glutamine and glycine, have been shown to be associated with human diseases. The number of repeats ranges from 8 to 35 for the CAG and from 10 to 30 for the GGN in human populations. Longer CAG repeats are associated with reduced hAR transcriptional activity, spinal bulbar muscular atrophy and lower cognitive function in older men, whereas shorter CAG repeats are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer and infertility in men. The functional roles of the CAG and GGN repeats have not been clarified. In order to compare the sequence of the CAG and GGN regions in apes, we analyzed 57 chimpanzees, 18 gorillas, 20 orangutans, 16 agile gibbons, and 17 siamangs by PCR and electrophoresis. Two bonobos and one long-tailed macaque were also sequenced and the sequences of all species were aligned, respectively, with one human registered sequence. Seventeen different alleles (4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, and 17-26 repeats) and 11 alleles (11-14 and 16-22 repeats) were detected at the CAG and the GGN loci, respectively. Although the repeat tract was conserved among apes, chimpanzees had alleles with a wide range of repeat lengths: (CAG)(14-26) and (GGN)(14-22). Gorillas were less polymorphic with the (CAG)(8) and (GGN)(19) alleles being most common, and orangutans exhibited monomorphic (CAG)(11) and (GGN)(22) alleles. On the other hand, agile gibbons and siamangs had the shortest (CAG)(4) allele, but showed variable length of GGN repeats (11-13 in agile gibbons and 16-21 in siamangs). In chimpanzees, frequent haplotypes consisting of short CAG repeats and long GGN repeats or vice versa was observed as in humans."
Hand preferences in captive orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus),"[""O'Malley, RC"", 'McGrew, WC']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-006-0180-1,JUL 2006,16,"The strength of the evidence for population-level handedness in the great apes is a topic of considerable debate, yet there have been few studies of handedness in orangutans. We conducted a study of manual lateralization in a captive group of eight orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) ranking the degrees of manual preference according to a defined framework. We analyzed five behavioral patterns: eat (one- and two-handed), make/modify tool, oral tool-use, and manual tool-use. Although some individuals showed significant manual preferences for one or more tasks, at the group-level both one-handed and two-handed eating, oral tool-use, and make/modify tool were ranked at level 1 (unlateralized). Manual tool-use was ranked at level 2, with four subjects demonstrating significant hand preferences, but no group-level bias to the right or left. Four subjects also showed hand specialization to the right or left across several tasks. These results are consistent with most previous studies of manual preference in orangutans. The emergence of manual lateralization in orangutans may relate to more complex manipulative tasks. We hypothesize that more challenging manual tasks elicit stronger hand preferences."
Comparative and familial analysis of handedness in great apes,"['Hopkins, WD']",PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN,10.1037/0033-2909.132.4.538,JUL 2006,87,"Historically, population-level handedness has been considered a hallmark of human evolution. Whether nonhuman primates exhibit population-level handedness remains a topic of considerable debate. This paper summarizes published data on handedness in great apes. Comparative analysis indicated that chimpanzees and bonobos show population-level right handedness, whereas gorillas and orangutans do not. All ape species showed evidence of population-level handedness when considering specific tasks. Familial analyses in chimpanzees indicated that offspring and maternal (but not paternal) handedness was significantly positively correlated, but this finding was contingent upon the classification criteria used to evaluate hand preference. Overall, the proportion of right handedness is lower in great apes compared with humans, and various methodological and theoretical explanations for this discrepancy are discussed."
Was the Early Pliocene hominin 'Australopithecus' anamensis a hard object feeder?,"['Grine, FE', 'Ungar, PS', 'Teaford, MF']",SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE,NA,JUL-AUG 2006,34,"Features that are characteristic of early hominin jaws and teeth have been widely perceived as having evolved to process food items that likely accompanied the expansion of drier, more open habitats in the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene. 'Australopithecus' anamensis has been envisaged as having undergone a dietary shift to harder and more brittle foods than were eaten by its presumptive ancestor, and has been argued to represent possibly the first hominin to have been adapted to such dietary objects. We were able to obtain data pertaining to molar microwear (and, thus, diet) for only three molars (individuals) of 72 available specimens of 'A.' anamensis, but the pattern common to all suggests that chimpanzees and gorillas constitute the best modern analogues for dietary preference in this Early Pliocene hominin. Microwear in 'A.' anamensis differs notably from that typically exhibited by extant primates that consume hard objects. Although 'A.' anamensis appears to have had the trophic capability to process a fairly wide range of foods, including the hard, brittle items that might be expected in the sorts of environments in which it is found, those few individuals we have been able to sample do not appear to have ingested these sorts of items while their microwear was being formed. The wear fabric exhibited by 'A.' anamensis is entirely encompassed by the pattern that defines Praeanthropus afarensis, and it is perhaps significant that this pattern appears to have remained little changed in this presumptive descendant of 'A.' anamensis. Explanatory scenarios that describe 'A.' anamensis as part of an evolutionary trajectory involving a more heavily masticated diet of hard, brittle items may need to be reconsidered."
Meta-analytic review of the effects of enrichment on stereotypic behavior in zoo mammals,"['Shyne, A']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20091,JUL-AUG 2006,35,"This meta-analysis reports the effect enrichment has on the occurrence of stereotypic behavior exhibited by captive zoo mammals. The analysis also identifies which types of enrichment are most effective, which groups of animals benefit the most, and which types of stereotypes are most affected by environmental enrichment. The analysis included 54 studies that yielded 63 effect size statistics. Fifty-seven of sixty-three effect sizes went in the predicted direction (90%), with the animals participating in less stereotypic behavior during the enrichment condition than in the baseline condition. The mean effect size (correlation coefficient r) was 0.46. The combined P-value using both fixed and random effects methods was reveled to be < 0.0000001. A file drawer N-value was calculated to identify the number of unretrieved studies'(with a combined effect size of zero) that would be needed to nullify the results of this analysis. The file drawer N-value was 1,726, suggesting that it is highly unlikely that the significant results reported in this analysis are nullified by studies that remain in file drawers. Based on these results it was concluded that enrichment substantially reduces the frequency of stereotypic behavior exhibited by mammals living in zoo environments."
Molecular evidence for the infection of zoo chimpanzees by pig Ascaris,"['Nejsum, P', 'Grondahl, C', 'Murrell, KD', 'SAUDI-ARABIA']",VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/j.vetpar.2006.02.025,JUN 30 2006,14,"We here describe the transmission of the pig roundworm, Ascaris suum to chimpanzees maintained in the Copenhagen Zoo. Denmark. Using a technique for whole genome fingerprinting, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and the technique PCR restricted fragment length polymorphism (PCR-PFLP) of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, the worms from the chimpanzees were compared with Ascaris spp obtained from humans and pigs in order to identify the source of the infection. By the use of different distance and clustering based methods on the AFLP data set the worms from the chimpanzees were assigned to the same cluster as that of the worms from pigs. The PCR-RFLP analysis supported the AFLP results. Therefore, the zoo chimpanzees have required Ascaris infections by cross-infection from pigs. Pigs as a potential source of Ascaris infections for both captive and wild chimpanzees and other animals. therefore needs to be considered and appropriate steps taken to prevent such infection.

Genetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees,"['Patterson, N', 'Richter, DJ', 'Gnerre, S', 'Lander, ES', 'Reich, D', 'DROSOPHILA-MAURITIANA']",NATURE,10.1038/nature04789,JUN 28 2006,293,"The genetic divergence time between two species varies substantially across the genome, conveying important information about the timing and process of speciation. Here we develop a framework for studying this variation and apply it to about 20 million base pairs of aligned sequence from humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and more distantly related primates. Human-chimpanzee genetic divergence varies from less than 84% to more than 147% of the average, a range of more than 4 million years. Our analysis also shows that human-chimpanzee speciation occurred less than 6.3 million years ago and probably more recently, conflicting with some interpretations of ancient fossils. Most strikingly, chromosome X shows an extremely young genetic divergence time, close to the genome minimum along nearly its entire length. These unexpected features would be explained if the human and chimpanzee lineages initially diverged, then later exchanged genes before separating permanently."
Demographic history and genetic differentiation in apes,"['Fischer, A', 'Pollack, J', 'Thalmann, O', 'Nickel, B', 'Paabo, S']",CURRENT BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cub.2006.04.033,JUN 6 2006,83,"Comparisons of genetic variation between humans and great apes are hampered by the fact that we still know little about the demographics and evolutionary history of the latter species [1-4]. In addition, characterizing ape genetic variation is important because they are threatened with extinction, and knowledge about genetic differentiation among groups may guide conservation efforts [5]. We sequenced multiple intergenic autosomal regions totaling 22,400 base pairs (bp) in ten individuals each from western, central, and eastern chimpanzee groups and in nine bonobos, and 16,000 by in ten Bornean and six Sumatran orangutans. These regions are analyzed together with homologous information from three human populations and gorillas. We find that whereas orangutans have the highest diversity, western chimpanzees have the lowest, and that the demographic histories of most groups differ drastically. Special attention should therefore be paid to sampling strategies and the statistics chosen when comparing levels of variation within and among groups. Finally, we find that the extent of genetic differentiation among ""subspecies"" of chimpanzees and orangutans is comparable to that seen among human populations, calling the validity of the ""subspecies"" concept in apes into question."
Afromontane old-field vegetation: secondary succession and the return of indigenous species,"['Karlowski, U']",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-2028.2006.00647.x,JUN 2006,9,"South-west Uganda primarily holds afromontane forests within three protected areas: Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, Echuya Forest Reserve and Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. All forests contain portions of old-field vegetation. The central question of this study, then, is whether and how natural regeneration of afromontane vegetation would take place. A successional pathway consisting of nine plant communities was found for the first 2 years after cessation of agricultural use. A return of afromontane species despite of an initial dominance of neophytes, a diversification of life form spectra and a growing importance of endozoochory with time belonged to the conspicuous characteristics of this secondary succession. To obtain an insight into the role of birds and buffaloes as possible vectors for seed input, I examined their faeces with regard to germinable seeds. Both, bird faeces, as well as buffalo faeces contained germinable seeds originating from the forest flora. Thus, animal dispersal from the forest into the regenerating zones could be documented. The regeneration potential of the soil-seed bank seems to be limited in its time scale, and only an initial regeneration capacity could be found. A further progressive succession into a secondary afromontane forest depends on an input of diaspores from undisturbed forest sites. Zoochory appears to be one of the most important dispersal mechanisms."
Biological and cultural anthropology of a changing tropical forest: A fruitful collaboration across subfields,"['Hardin, R', 'Remis, MJ']",AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST,10.1525/aa.2006.108.2.273,JUN 2006,8,"In this article, we integrate approaches from biological and cultural anthropology to describe changing relationships between humans and animals in the Dzanga-Ndoki Park and Dzanga-Sangha Dense Forest Reserve (RDS), Central African Republic (CAR). Recent decades have seen a rapid proliferation of human activities, with striking tensions between logging and conservation economies. Our data suggest that certain animals and humans initially adapted successfully to these forest uses, and that local residents have crafted culturally rich new ways of living in the forest. However, our longitudinal data indicate animal declines and expanding frontiers of increasingly intensive human use. These trends are altering previous territorial arrangements and coming to undermine today's remarkably rich spectrum of human-animal encounters there. Our combined approach offers an alternative to increasingly distinct method and theory between anthropology's subfields. We sketch a research agenda for integrated anthropological attention to environmental change, especially to transformations in human-animal interactions and entanglements."
Interpretation of bootstrap values in phylogenetic analysis.,"['Wiesemuller, Bernhard', 'Rothe, Hartmut']",Anthropologischer Anzeiger; Bericht uber die biologisch-anthropologische Literatur,NA,2006-Jun,2,"Bootstrap Analysis is a common tool in cladistics, and consequently many authors tend to believe that it could be close to a test of monophyly. In fact, it is only a procedure to calculate the redundancy of a certain character pattern among taxa. To demonstrate this, we set up a study with questionable data: Four skulls of great apes and humans were digitally photographed, and the pixels' brightness values were simply transformed to a one-zero-matrix, which was then used to calculate a Wagner tree with PHYLIP. As a rule, the higher the resolution of the photos is, the higher are the bootstrap values of supported taxa (and the lower are the bootstrap values of non-supported data). Redundancy of intertaxic information might indeed be an indicator of phylogenetic relationship, but can also be due to other reasons, like functional-adaptive needs in morphology, or semantic needs in a DNA-code. As a result, we tend to believe that high bootstrap values are actually less important than low ones. It is safer, based on a low bootstrap value, to claim that a certain taxon is not well supported by certain data. Therefore, we recommend discussions of low bootstrap values in future publications."
"Parasitic nematodes in the chimpanzee population on Rubondo Island, Tanzania","['Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Hasegawa, H', 'Moscovice, LR', 'Kaur, T', 'Issa, M', 'Huffman, MA']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-006-9043-2,JUN 2006,15,"We identified 3 nematodes not previously reported in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) introduced on Rubondo Island, Tanzania: Protospirura muricola, Subulura sp., and Anatrichosoma sp. Vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops pygerythrus), rodents, and intermediate insect hosts might maintain Protospirura muricola and Subulura sp., and indigenous monkeys on the island might also maintain Anatrichosoma sp. Low prevalence of Subulura sp. and Anatrichosoma sp. suggests that chimpanzees acquired them from ingestion of contaminated food."
Morphological analysis of the hindlimb in apes and humans. I.

Muscle mass and fascicle length data were obtained for all major hindlimb muscles. Physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) was estimated. Data were normalized assuming geometric similarity to allow for comparison of animals of different size/species. Muscle mass scaled closely to (body mass)(1.0) and fascicle length scaled closely to (body mass)(0.3) in most species. However, human hindlimb muscles were heavy and had short fascicles per unit body mass when compared with non-human apes. Gibbon hindlimb anatomy shared some features with human hindlimbs that were not observed in the non-human great apes: limb circumferences tapered from proximal-to-distal, fascicle lengths were short per unit body mass and tendons were relatively long. Non-human great ape hindlimb muscles were, by contrast, characterized by long fascicles arranged in parallel, with little/no tendon of insertion. Such an arrangement of muscle architecture would be useful for locomotion in a three dimensionally complex arboreal environment."
Morphological analysis of the hindlimb in apes and humans. II.

Moment arms varied with joint motion and were generally longer in proximal limb muscles than distal limb muscles. The shape of the moment arm curves (i.e. the plots of moment arm against joint angle) differed in different hindlimb muscles and in the same muscle in different subjects (both in the same and in different ape species). Most moment arms increased with increasing joint flexion, a finding which may be understood in the context of the employment of flexed postures by most non-human apes (except orang-utans) during both terrestrial and arboreal locomotion. When compared with humans, non-human great apes tended to have muscles better designed for moving the joints through large ranges. This was particularly true of the pedal digital flexors in orang-utans. In gibbons, the only lesser ape studied here, many of the moment arms measured were relatively short compared with those of great apes. This study was performed on a small sample of apes and thus differences noted here warrant further investigation in larger populations."
"A fossil hominoid proximal femur from Kikorongo Crater, southwestern Uganda","['DeSilva, J', 'Shoreman, E', 'MacLatchy, L', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.01.008,JUN 2006,1,"The external morphology of a fragmentary right proximal femur from southwestern Uganda is described here. Discovered in the Kikorongo Crater of Queen Elizabeth National Park in 1961, this specimen was informally assigned to Homo sapiens (although never described) and tentatively dated to the late Pleistocene. However, because aspects of the external morphology of the femur align the fossil with the African great apes, we suggest that the Kikorongo femur may be the first postcranial fossil of the genus Pan. Like the African apes, the Kikorongo specimen lacks both an obturator externus groove and an intertrochanteric line. It has a short femoral neck with a circular cross section, and a narrow and deep superior notch. Using resampling statistics and discriminant function analysis, the Kikorongo femur clustered with the genus Pan, as opposed to Gorilla or Homo. However, if the specimen is from Pan, it would be large for this taxon. Furthermore, features that clearly distinguish the external morphology of Plio-Pleistocene hominin proximal femora from African ape femora, such as the shape of the femoral neck in cross section and femoral neck length, have converged in Holocene humans and African apes. Unfortunately, the internal morphology of the femoral neck of the Kikorongo fossil was not discernable. Although we hypothesize that the Kikorongo femur is from the genus Pan, there is such variability in the proximal femora of modem humans that, although it would be an unusual human, it remains possible that this fossil represents H. sapiens.

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) was found to decrease more rapidly with age than total cholesterol, resulting in an increasing ratio of cholesterol HDL with age. The ratio of apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A1 also increased with age. Establishment of a database of blood lipid values for captive gorillas with correlative analysis of animals with known atherosclerosis status may help to identify sensitive predictors of coronary heart disease risk."

Ancient positive selection on CD155 as a possible cause for susceptibility to poliovirus infection in simians,"['Suzuki, Y']",GENE,10.1016/j.gene.2005.12.016,MAY 24 2006,2,"Poliovirus is the etiological agent of poliomyelitis. From the observations that only simians are susceptible to poliovirus infection and that 37 amino acid sites (the poliovirus-binding associated [PBA] sites) in the domain D I of CD 155 are involved in the binding to poliovirus, it is considered that the susceptibility to poliovirus infection evolved through amino acid substitutions that occurred at the PBA sites on the ancestral branch of simians. Here it is shown that positive selection has operated on these substitutions by analyzing the nucleotide sequences encoding almost the entire region of D I in humans, non-human hominoids (chimpanzees and gorillas), Old World monkeys (African green monkeys), New World monkeys (brown capuchins, squirrel monkeys, and marmosets), prosimians (ring-tailed lemurs), and non-primate mammals (rabbits). Positive selection is unlikely to have operated on the susceptibility to poliovirus infection, but possibly on the binding to another molecule. Elimination of susceptibility to poliovirus infection in simians may be difficult, because it also requires elimination of advantageous effects that have been exerted by CD155. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Loss of Siglec expression on T lymphocytes during human evolution,"['Nguyen, DH', 'Hurtado-Ziola, N', 'Gagneux, P', 'Varki, A']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0510484103,MAY 16 2006,108,"We report here that human T cells give much stronger proliferative responses to specific activation via the T cell receptor (TCR) than those from chimpanzees, our closest evolutionary relatives. Nonspecific activation using phytohemagglutinin was robust in chimpanzee T cells, indicating that the much lower response to TCR simulation is not due to any intrinsic inability to respond to an activating stimulus. CD33-related Siglecs are inhibitory signaling molecules expressed on most immune cells and are thought to down-regulate cellular activation pathways via cytosolic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. Among human immune cells, T lymphocytes are a striking exception, expressing little to none of these molecules. In stark contrast, we find that T lymphocytes from chimpanzees as well as the other closely related ""great apes"" (bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) express several CD33-related Siglecs on their surfaces. Thus, human-specific loss of T cell Siglec expression occurred after our last common ancestor with great apes, potentially resulting in an evolutionary difference with regard to inhibitory signaling. We confirmed this by studying Siglec-5, which is prominently expressed on chimpanzee lymphocytes, including CD4T cells. Ab-mediated clearance of Siglec-5 from chimpanzee T cells enhanced TCR-mediated activation. Conversely, primary human T cells and Jurkat cells transfected with Siglec-5 become less responsive; i.e., they behave more like chimpanzee T cells. This human-specific loss of T cell Siglec expression associated with T cell hyperactivity may help explain the strikingly disparate prevalence and severity of T cell-mediated diseases such as AIDS and chronic active hepatitis between humans and chimpanzees."

However, the sample size is extremely small, relying upon mostly fractured specimens and a few sectioned specimens, providing an estimate of enamel thickness only. What is needed to fully understand the significance of enamel thickness is a non-destructive technique that is able to obtain the thickness, density, and volume of the dental hard tissues of large samples, thereby providing an accurate means of relating thickness, area, volume, and the pattern of distribution of both enamel and dentin. Investigators have attempted to circumvent this problem by developing a variety of indexes. However, we are still left with subjective descriptions, such as 'thin', 'thick', 'intermediate thick', and 'hyperthick'. The purpose of this investigation was therefore to demonstrate the ability of high-resolution X-ray computed microtomography (HRXCT), as a non-destructive method, to produce, accurately and reliably, contiguous slices revealing the thickness and area of enamel, dentin, and pulp chamber. Using imaging software, three-dimensional reconstructions were produced, which provided volume data for enamel and dentin. Three-dimensional reconstruction of HRXCT images provide, for the first time, the capability of accurately quantifying enamel and dentin thickness, distribution and volume, thereby eliminating the necessity of destructive thin-sectional analysis."

Independent evolution of bitter-taste sensitivity in humans and chimpanzees,"['Wooding, S', 'Bufe, B', 'Grassi, C', 'Howard, MT', 'Stone, AC', 'Vazquez, M', 'Dunn, DM', 'Meyerhof, W', 'Weiss, RB', 'Bamshad, MJ']",NATURE,10.1038/nature04655,APR 13 2006,69,"It was reported over 65 years ago that chimpanzees, like humans, vary in taste sensitivity to the bitter compound phenylthiocarbamide (PTC)(1). This was suggested to be the result of a shared balanced polymorphism, defining the first, and now classic, example of the effects of balancing selection in great apes. In humans, variable PTC sensitivity is largely controlled by the segregation of two common alleles at the TAS2R38 locus, which encode receptor variants with different ligand affinities(2-4). Here we show that PTC taste sensitivity in chimpanzees is also controlled by two common alleles of TAS2R38; however, neither of these alleles is shared with humans. Instead, a mutation of the initiation codon results in the use of an alternative downstream start codon and production of a truncated receptor variant that fails to respond to PTC in vitro. Association testing of PTC sensitivity in a cohort of captive chimpanzees confirmed that chimpanzee TAS2R38 genotype accurately predicts taster status in vivo. Therefore, although Fisher et al.'s observations(1) were accurate, their explanation was wrong. Humans and chimpanzees share variable taste sensitivity to bitter compounds mediated by PTC receptor variants, but the molecular basis of this variation has arisen twice, independently, in the two species."

Molecular studies have demonstrated that tooth development is under strict genetic control, but, the genetic basis of primate tooth variation remains unknown. The PAX9 gene, which codes for a paired domain-containing transcription factor that plays an essential role in the development of mammal dentition, has been associated with selective tooth agenesis in humans and mice, which mainly involves the posterior teeth. To determine whether this gene is polymorphic in humans, we sequenced approximate to 2.1 kb of the entire four-exon region (exons 1, 2, 3 and 4; 1,026 bp) and exon-intron (1.1 kb) boundaries of 86 individuals sampled from Asian, European, and Native American populations. We provided evidence that human PAX9 polymorphisims are limited to exon 3 only and furnished details about the distribution of a mutation there in 350 Polish subjects. To investigate the pattern of selective pressure on exon 3, we sequenced ortholog regions of this exon in four species of New World monkeys and one gorilla. In addition, orthologous sequences of PAX9 available in public databases were also analyzed. Although several differences were identified between humans and other species, our findings support the view that strong purifying selection is acting on PAX9. New World and Old World primate lineages may, however, have different degrees of restriction for changes in this DNA region."

Apes' use of iconic cues in the object-choice task,"['Herrmann, E', 'Melis, AP', 'Tomasello, M']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-005-0013-4,APR 2006,9,"In previous studies great apes have shown little ability to locate hidden food using a physical marker placed by a human directly on the target location. In this study, we hypothesized that the perceptual similarity between an iconic cue and the hidden reward (baited container) would help apes to infer the location of the food. In the first two experiments, we found that if an iconic cue is given in addition to a spatial/indexical cue - e.g., picture or replica of a banana placed on the target location - apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, gorillas) as a group performed above chance. However, we also found in two further experiments that when iconic cues were given on their own without spatial/indexical information (iconic cue held up by human with no diagnostic spatial/indexical information), the apes were back to chance performance. Our overall conclusion is that although iconic information helps apes in the process of searching hidden food, the poor performance found in the last two experiments is due to apes' lack of understanding of the informative (cooperative) communicative intention of the experimenter."
Morphological and functional analysis of the pelvis in Catarrhines: consequences for obstetrics.,"['Bouhallier, J', 'Berge, C', 'AUSTRALOPITHECINES']",COMPTES RENDUS PALEVOL,10.1016/j.crpv.2005.12.007,APR-MAY 2006,6,"The study aimed at connecting obstetrical adaptations in Catarrhines with (1) locomotor specializations in the pelvic cavity, and (2) neonate encephalization. The material comprised 49 pelves, 18 skulls of adult females, and 9 neonate skulls. The neonate dimensions were placed in the pelvic inlet, midplane and outlet (mean pelvic shape obtained by Procrustes superimposition) and compared with adult dimensions. The results showed that non-human primates possess simple obstetrical mechanics that may present some difficulties, either because the fetus is proportionally large (Hylobates), or because locomotor specializations reduce the pelvic dimensions (Papio). Humans have complex obstetrical mechanics, resulting from bipedalism and parturition interactions. Encephalization did not play a determinant role in the evolution of human obstetrics."

Sumatran orangutans and a yellow-cheeked crested gibbon know what is where,"['Scheumann, M', 'Call, J']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-006-9024-5,APR 2006,8,"In their natural habitats orangutans and gibbons have to solve spatial problems to find enough food, which is distributed over large areas and available at different times of the year. Therefore both species should evolve spatial memory skills to remember spatial locations and their content. We conducted 2 studies in a 1900-m(2) naturalistic outdoor enclosure. In the 1st study, we hid kiwi pieces in 10 different locations and placed kiwi pieces in a visible location. Individuals of both species approached significantly more food locations in the test condition than in the control condition in which no food was hidden. In the 2nd study, we hid 2 types of food in 10 different locations so that individuals had to remember which food type was where. We hid bananas on trees (banana condition) and grapes under bamboo shrubs (grape condition). We also placed oranges in full view (control condition) to rule out the possibility that finding food may automatically trigger an indiscriminate search. Individuals approached the banana locations more often in the banana than in the other 2 conditions. Some orangutans, but not the gibbon, also approached the grape locations more often in the grape than in the other 2 conditions. Individuals often returned to locations in which they previously found food and rarely revisited locations in the same session. We detected little influence of the food quantity and no influence of the distance to each location on the subjects' foraging behavior."
Effects of forest type and human presence on bonobo (Pan paniscus) density in the Salonga National Park,"['Reinartz, GE', 'Isia, IB', 'Ngamankosi, M', 'Wema, LW']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-006-9020-9,APR 2006,21,"Our study elucidates how forest type characteristics and human presence influence bonobo (Pan paniscus) densities and assesses whether the Salonga National Park harbors a substantial bonobo population. We searched 11 locations in the Salonga for the presence of bonobos and sampled 9 study sites using line transects to estimate relative bonobo nest density, the proportion of forest types, and the intensity of human activity. We classified forests into broad types by overstory and understory composition, canopy cover, and hydrology, and calculated encounter rates for bonobo, human, and large mammal signs. Bonobo signs occurred in 8 of 11 locations but varied widely in frequency. Mean density was 0.72 nest-builders/km(2), but density was not uniform across sites (range=0-2.8 nest-builders/km(2)). Of 11 forest types encountered, the most common were mixed mature forest with an herbaceous (Marantaceae) understory (36.8%), with a woody understory (23.6%), and old secondary forest with a Marantaceae understory (10.5%). Nest sites occurred only in these forest types, called nest-forest types. Bonobo density was highest in locations comprising > 80% nest-forest types. Nests occurred more frequently in the mixed mature/Marantaceae forest. Nest-site density correlates positively with the nest-forest patch length we encountered on transects, implying that forest patch size and consistency may influence bonobo density. Mean nest group size correlates positively with proportion of nest-forest types found at a site, suggesting that increased resource availability-nesting sites and food-allows larger group size. A significant inverse association existed between bonobo density and human presence."
"Feeding behavior, diet, and the functional consequences of jaw form in orangutans, with implications for the evolution of Pongo","['Taylor, AB']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.10.006,APR 2006,50,"Orangutans are amongst the most craniometrically variable of the extant great apes, yet there has been no attempt to explicitly link this morphological variation with observed differences in behavioral ecology. This study explores the relationship between feeding behavior, diet, and mandibular morphology in orangutans. All orangutans prefer ripe, pulpy fruit when available. However, some populations of Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus morio and P. p. wurmbii) rely more heavily on bark and relatively tough vegetation during periods of low fruit yield than do Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii). I tested the hypothesis that Bornean orangutans exhibit structural features of the mandible that provide greater load resistance abilities to masticatory and incisal forces. Compared to P. abelii, P. p. mono exhibits greater load resistance abilities as reflected in a relatively deeper mandibular corpus, deeper and wider mandibular symphysis, and relatively greater condylar area. P. p. wurmbii exhibits most of these same morphologies, and in all comparisons is either comparable in jaw proportions to P. p. morio, or intermediate between P. p. morio and P. abelii. These data indicate that P. p. morio and P. p. wurmbii are better suited to resisting large and/or frequent jaw loads than P. abelii. Using these results, I evaluated mandibular morphology in P. p. pygmaeus, a Bornean orangutan population whose behavioral ecology is poorly known. Pongo p. pygmaeus generally exhibits relatively greater load resistance capabilities than P. abelii, but less than P. p. mono. These results suggest that P. p. pygmaeus may consume greater amounts of tougher and/or more obdurate foods than P. abelii. and that consumption of such foods may intensify amongst Bornean orangutan populations. Finally, data from this study are used to evaluate variation in craniomandibular morphology in Khoratpithecus piriyai, possibly the earliest relative of Pongo from the late Miocene of Thailand, and the late Pleistocene Hoa Binh subfossil orangutan recovered from Vietnam. With the exception of a relatively thicker M, mandibular corpus. K. piriyai has jaw proportions that would be expected for an extant orangutan of comparable jaw size. Likewise, the Hoa Binh subfossil does not differ in skull proportions from extant Pongo, independent of the effects of increase in jaw size. These results indicate that differences in skull and mandibular proportions between these fossil and subfossil orangutans and extant Pongo are allometric. Furthermore, the ability of K. piriyai to resist jaw loads appears to have been comparable to that of extant orangutans. However, the similarity in jaw proportions between P. abelii and K. piriyai suggest the latter may have been dietarily more similar to Sumatran orangutans. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Metric variation and sexual dimorphism in the dentition of Ouranopithecus macedoniensis,"['Schrein, CM', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.11.007,APR 2006,8,"The fossil sample attributed to the late Miocene hominoid taxon Ouranopithecus macedoniensis is characterized by a high degree of dental metric variation. AS a result, some researchers support a multiple-species taxonomy for this sample. Other researchers do not think that the sample variation is too great to be accommodated within one species. This study examines variation and sexual dimorphism in mandibular canine and postcanine dental metrics of an Ouranopithecus sample. Bootstrapping (resampling with replacement) of extant hominoid dental metric data is performed to test the hypothesis that the coefficients of variation (CV) and the indices of sexual dimorphism (ISD) of the fossil sample are not significantly different from those of modern great apes.

Variation and sexual dimorphism in Ouranopithecus M, dimensions were statistically different from those of all extant ape samples; however, most of the dental metrics of Ouranopithecus were neither more variable nor more sexually dimorphic than those of Gorilla and Pongo. Similarly high levels of mandibular molar variation are known to characterize other fossil hominoid species. The Ouranopithecus specimens are morphologically homogeneous and it is probable that all but one specimen included in this study are froth a single population. It is unlikely that the sample includes specimens of two sympatric large-bodied hominoid species. For these reasons, a single-species hypothesis is not rejected for the Ouranopithecus macedoniensis material. Correlations between mandibular first molar tooth size dimorphism and body size dimorphism indicate that O. macedoniensis and other extinct hominoids were more sexually size dimorphic than any living great apes, which suggests that social behaviors and life history profiles of these species may have been different froth those of living species.

Sequencing and haplotype analysis of the Activator of CREM in the Testis (ACT) gene in populations of fertile and infertile males,"['Christensen, GL', 'Wooding, SP', 'Ivanov, IP', 'Atkins, JF', 'Carrell, DT']",MOLECULAR HUMAN REPRODUCTION,10.1093/molehr/ga1006,APR 2006,14,"cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) is a key transcription factor in the differentiation of round spermatids into mature spermatozoa. During spermiogenesis, CREM is regulated in part by activator of CREM in the testis (ACT), which activates CREM in a phosphorylation-independent fashion. We hypothesized that the ACT gene, which is expressed exclusively in the testis, could be involved in male factor infertility in patients with idiopathic-impaired spermatogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the coding regions and flanking intronic regions of the ACT gene in 96 azoo- or oligospermic patients and 69 fertile controls. A total of 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was identified, and four of them leading to amino acid substitutions. An association study was performed based on calculated haplotype frequencies, and statistically significant differences were found between the patient and control populations for some haplotypes. To help establish the evolutionary relationships between the haplotypes, the coding regions of both the chimpanzee and the gorilla ACT gene were sequenced and evaluated. To test whether the different haplotypes conferred a functional change to the ACT protein, a yeast two-hybrid assay was designed to test the interaction between the two most divergent ACT haplotypes and their known binding partners, CREM and KIF17b. We identified one ACT haplotype that had a 45% reduction in its interaction with CREM. Our results suggest that different haplotypes within the ACT gene may contribute to male factor subfertility."

In the present study, using a probe derived from the gorilla fosmid library, we detected the paralogous locus (7q31.3) of the HERV-R em, gene in human chromosome 7q11.2, and also determined the chromosomal location in apes and Old World monkeys. The HERV-R gene was not detected in New World monkeys or prosimians with FISH and PCR analyses. We determined the sequences of the HERV-R env genes obtained from the genomic DNA of primates using PCR and sequencing tools. Except for a HERV-R env, sequence derived from gorilla DNA, the functional domains of putative envelope proteins are conserved, suggesting that those domains could have a functional capacity in the primate genome. In addition, we investigated the ent, gene expression of HERV-R in various human tissues and cancer cells. An RT-PCR approach indicated that the em, gene was expressed in several human tissues (brain, prostate, testis, kidney, placenta, thymus, and uterus) and cancer cells (RT4, BT-474, MCF7, OVCAR-3, LOX-IMVI, and AZ521). Taken together, our data could be of Great use for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of HERV-R through primate radiation as well as the implications of its functional role in human tissues and cancers cells.

Lingual incisor traits in modern hominoids and an assessment of their utility for fossil hominoid taxonomy,"['Pilbrow, V']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20246,MAR 2006,13,"The morphology of the anterior dentition has received scant attention for purposes of taxonomic discrimination. Recently, however, lingual incisor morphology was used in differentiating several Miocene ape species and genera. This paper assesses the utility of this morphology for taxonomic discrimination by examining the nature and patterns of variation in lingual incisor morphology in extensive samples of modern chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons. This paper documents discrete morphological traits on the lingual side of incisors. Trait frequencies are used in univariate and multivariate analyses to examine the apportionment of variation in species, subspecies, and populations. A correlation between lingual incisor traits, tooth dimensions, and sex attempts to determine if such factors affect the manifestation of traits. Finally, the findings are applied to understanding patterns of variation in the Miocene hominids. The study demonstrates that: 1) lingual incisor morphology differs substantially between the hylobatids and great apes; 2) variation in incisor traits is high within species, and most of it is found within local populations; and 3) incisor traits do not correlate significantly with incisor dimensions or sex. Species and to some extent subspecies of extant hominoids can be differentiated statistically using lingual incisor traits, but the frequency of traits such as continuous or discontinuous cingulum, or the presence or absence of pillars, differentiates them. Given this pattern of variation, I argue that it is necessary to assume and document similar patterns of variation in Miocene apes before incisor morphology is used for differentiating taxa."
Comparison of different enzymeimmunoassays for assessment of adrenocortical activity in primates based on fecal analysis,"['Heistermann, M', 'Palme, R', 'Ganswindt, A']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20222,MAR 2006,82,"Most studies published to date that used fecal glucocorticoid measurements to assess adrenocortical activity in primate (and many nonprimate) species applied a specific cortisol or corticosterone assay. However, since these native glucocorticoids are virtually absent in the feces of most vertebrates, including primates, the validity of this approach has recently been questioned. Therefore, the overall aim of the present study was to assess the validity of four enzymeimmunoassays (EIAs) using antibodies raised against cortisol, corticosterone, and reduced cortisol metabolites (two group-specific antibodies) for assessing adrenocortical activity using fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (GCM) measurements in selected primate species (marmoset, long-tailed macaque, Barbary macaque, chimpanzee, and gorilla). Using physiological stimulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis by administering exogenous ACTH or anesthesia, we demonstrated that at least two assays detected the predicted increase in fecal GCM levels in response to treatment in each species. However, the magnitude of response varied between assays and species, and no one assay was applicable to all species. While the corticosterone assay generally was of only limited suitability for assessing glucocorticoid output, the specific cortisol assay was valuable for those species that (according to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis data) excreted clearly detectable amounts of authentic cortisol into the feces. In contrast, in species in which cortisol was virtually absent in the feces, group-specific assays provided a much stronger signal, and these assays also performed well in the other primate species tested (except the marmoset). Collectively, the data suggest that the reliability of a given fecal glucocorticoid assay in reflecting activity of the HPA axis in primates clearly depends on the species in question. Although to date there is no single assay system that can be used successfully across species, our data suggest that group-specific assays have a high potential for cross-species application. Nevertheless, regardless of which GC antibody is chosen, our study clearly reinforces the necessity of appropriately validating the respective assay system before it is used."
Living in nonbreeding groups: An alternative strategy for maturing gorillas,"['Levrero, F', 'Gatti, S', 'Menard, N', 'Petit, E', 'Caillaud, D', 'Gautier-Hion, A']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20223,MAR 2006,15,"The one-male reproductive strategy implies that maturing males are temporarily excluded from reproduction. In gorillas, these excluded males live either solitarily or in nonbreeding groups (NBGs) that are devoid of adult females. The dynamics of NBGs are not well known. In this study, which was conducted on a gorilla population (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) of 377 individuals that visited the Lokoue clearing in the Republic of Congo, we detail how the NBGs formed, and analyze their dynamics according to age-sex classes, the relatedness of members, and the origin and destination of transferring individuals. We discuss the potential benefits gained by individuals living in these groups. The NBGs included mainly immature males, most of which appeared to have migrated voluntarily from their natal groups. Some individuals (including juvenile females) came from disbanded breeding groups (BGs). Migrants preferentially joined NBGs that included a silverback male. Their dispersal patterns were not determined by their degree of relatedness, but they tended to associate with related silverbacks. In this way, the migrants could enhance their protection against predators and gain experience with different environmental conditions. By tolerating and protecting offspring, aging silverbacks could enhance their inclusive fitness. Finally, young and healthy silverbacks could increase their likelihood of forming a future BG when unrelated females joined them."
"Object manipulation to obtain a food reward in hoolock gibbons, Bunopithecus hoolock","['Cunningham, CL', 'Anderson, JR', 'Mootnick, AR']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.05.013,MAR 2006,23,"Gibbons (family Hylobatidae) have rarely been studied in terms of object manipulation and tool use. We assessed whether hoolock gibbons can learn to pull on a rake-like object to gain a food reward, in a zero-order manipulation task, without specific training. Their learning style was assessed along with their understanding of the tertiary relationships between the rake, a goal object and an environmental feature. Hoolocks used a rake to pull in an out-of-reach food item in less than 90 s on first presentation. The gibbons' behaviour suggests that perceptually restructuring the environment may be within this species' abilities. Their causal understanding of three factors, the rake, the reward and a trap into which the reward could fall and be lost, was moderately better than that of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, and capuchins, Cebus spp., on a similar task. Learning of simple associative rules, rather than understanding the physical properties of the trap, might explain the gibbons' performance.

The material of Ouranopithecus from the three known localities ""Ravin de la Pluie"" (RPI), ""Xirochori 1"" (XIR) and ""Nikiti 1"" (NKT) includes a complete series of tooth rows representing ail wearing stages. Thus, the study of the dental wear of Ouranopithecus upper and lower teeth is studied and compared to that of the recent hominoids Gorilla and Pan, as well as to Australopithecus afarensis. The latter species is well known by a series of tooth rows of different wearing stages. The canine's attrition of Ouranopithecus has a more derived pattern than that of the recent hominoids (Gorilla and Pan) and less derived than A. afarensis. The p3 of Ouranopithecus has similar attrition to that of A. afarensis, the attrition of the molars in Ouranopithecus, A. afarensis and Pan follows a similar pattern, while in Gorilla it is different.

Identification of large-scale human-specific copy number differences by inter-species array comparative genomic hybridization,"['Goidts, V', 'Armengol, L', 'Schempp, W', 'Conroy, J', 'Nowak, N', 'Muller, S', 'Cooper, DN', 'Estivill, X', 'Enard, W', 'Szamalek, JM', 'Hameister, H', 'Kehrer-Sawatzki, H']",HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s00439-005-0130-9,MAR 2006,26,"Copy number differences (CNDs), and the concomitant differences in gene number, have contributed significantly to the genomic divergence between humans and other primates. To assess its relative importance, the genomes of human, common chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan and macaque were compared by comparative genomic hybridization using a high-resolution human BAC array (aCGH). In an attempt to avoid potential interference from frequent intra-species polymorphism, pooled DNA samples were used from each species. A total of 322 sites of large-scale inter-species CND were identified. Most CNDs were lineage-specific but frequencies differed considerably between the lineages; the highest CND frequency among hominoids was observed in gorilla. The conserved nature of the orangutan genome has already been noted by karyotypic studies and our findings suggest that this degree of conservation may extend to the sub-microscopic level. Of the 322 CND sites identified, 14 human lineage-specific gains were observed. Most of these human-specific copy number gains span regions previously identified as segmental duplications (SDs) and our study demonstrates that SDs are major sites of CND between the genomes of humans and other primates. Four of the human-specific CNDs detected by aCGH map close to the breakpoints of human-specific karyotypic changes [e.g., the human-specific inversion of chromosome 1 and the polymorphic inversion inv(2)(p11.2q13)], suggesting that human-specific duplications may have predisposed to chromosomal rearrangement. The association of human-specific copy number gains with chromosomal breakpoints emphasizes their potential importance in mediating karyotypic evolution as well as in promoting human genomic diversity."
"Death at the zoo: The media, science, and reality","['Hutchins, M']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20085,MAR-APR 2006,4,"Media characterizations of zoo and aquarium animal deaths were randomly monitored on the internet for a 20-month period (September 2003-May 2005). Based on 148 samples collected, it was possible to classify articles into one of four categories, which were operationally defined: 1) dispassionate observers; 2) accusers; 3) sympathizers; and 4) balancers. In addition, with the notable exception of seven cases, all of the articles examined focused on large, charismatic mammals, such as gorillas, dolphins, lions, and elephants. Although a majority of the articles examined (70.4%) were either dispassionate and objective or sympathetic, nearly a third (29.6%) were either accusatory or attempted to balance the accusatory statements of animal rights activists with sympathetic statements from zoo professionals. Recommendations are offered for how zoos should deal with the increasing media and public interest in zoo animal deaths, including: 1) a greater commitment to studying the reasons for mortality in a wide variety of species; and 2) an increased investment in record keeping and analysis, which should allow zoos to calculate average life spans in animal populations and to monitor and assess the risk of certain lethal diseases on a real-time basis. Comparisons are drawn between zoo veterinary practices and human medicine, which are both inexact sciences. Suggestions are made for how the public and key decision-makers can distinguish between media reports on zoo animal deaths that are legitimate cause for concern vs. those that are sensationalist and meant to generate controversy and sell papers. A greater focus on the science of zoo animal death is necessary for accredited zoos to maintain the public's confidence in their animal care practices. Zoo Biol 25:101-115, 2006.

Pattern of maternal serum corticotropin-releasing hormone concentration during pregnancy in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus),"['Power, ML', 'Bowman, ME', 'Smith, R', 'Ziegler, TE', 'Layne, DG', 'Schulkin, J', 'Tardif, SD']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20215,FEB 2006,12,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a potent neuropeptide, is produced by the placenta of anthropoid primates. No other mammals, including prosimian primates, are known to produce placental CRH. In humans, placental CRH appears to play an important role in the progression of pregnancy to parturition. Maternal circulating CRH begins to rise early in pregnancy and increases until parturition. Gorillas and chimpanzees share this pattern of increasing maternal CRH during pregnancy with humans. In humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, maternal CRH and estradiol concentrations are correlated, consistent with the hypothesis that CRH is involved in the biosynthetic pathway for placental estrogen production. In contrast, in baboons, maternal circulating CRH rises precipitously early in pregnancy and then declines, though CRH is detectable until birth. This research was designed to investigate the pattern of maternal circulating CRH in the common marmoset during pregnancy. Blood samples were taken across gestation from nine subjects over 11 pregnancies, and the plasma was assayed for CRH. The pattern of maternal circulating CRH in the common marmoset was similar to that of the baboon, with a rapid rise starting at about 50 days postconception and a peak at approximately 70 days postconception. By 110 days postconception, CRH concentration had plateaued at a significantly lower value. The peak and mean values for CRH were associated with fetal number (e.g., females gestating triplets had higher values than females gestating twins). Urinary estradiol showed no association with plasma CRH concentration. Marmosets appear to differ from the great apes in this regard, and to share a pattern of maternal CRH during pregnancy with the baboon, indicating that the baboon and marmoset pattern may be ancestral. The function of the early rapid rise of CRH in baboons and marmosets, and the significance of this difference between monkeys and apes, are not known."

This is the first report of Cryptosporidium and other protozoan infections (Entamoeba spp., lodamoeba, Chilomastix, and Balantidium Spp.) in wild primates that inhabit the natural forest of Sri Lanka. It is unclear if non-human primates serve as a reservoir for these parasites under certain conditions. A cross-sectional coprologic survey among 125 monkeys (89 toque macaques, 21 gray langurs, and 1.5 purple-faced langurs) indicated that Cryptosporidium was detected in all three primate species and was most common among monkeys using areas and water that had been heavily soiled by human feces and livestock. Most macaques (96%) ;shedding Cryptosporidium oocysts were co-infected with other protozoans and important anthropozoonotic gastrointestinal parasites (e.g., Enterobius and Strongyloides). The transmission of these parasites among primates in the wild may have important implications for public health as well as wildlife conservation management."

Gorilla Behavior Index revisited: Age, housing and behavior","['Kuhar, CW', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Lukas, KE', 'Maple, TL']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2005.06.004,FEB 2006,23,"While personality and temperament assessments are becoming more common in animal science as a means for predicting behavior patterns, they are virtually unstudied in exotic animals outside of chimpanzees. We assessed behavioral profiles of 119 male gorillas using the Gorilla Behavior Index (GBI) and paired this assessment with behavior data on 25 male gorillas from our ongoing analysis of multi-male gorilla groups in North America. This comparison was made to determine if the GBI could be predictive of behavior patterns, with the hope that this could eventually be utilized to aid in the management of multi-male gorilla groups. With few exceptions, GBI factor scores were not related to age Of Subjects or their current housing condition. Individuals scoring high on the Extroverted factor were more likely to initiate and receive affiliative behaviors, but they were also more likely to initiate contact aggression. Those gorillas who scored high on the Dominant factor were more likely to initiate displacements and less likely to receive them. Gorillas rated as more Fearful were less likely to initiate displacements and those rated as less Understanding were more likely to initiate non-contact aggression. Two facts are evident from these data: (1) further work needs to be done to verify that the GBI is indeed assessing traits and not current behavioral states and (2) any relationships with behavior frequency are relatively weak. In addition to further exploration of the GBI we recommend other assessments to compliment the GBI to establish stronger links between `subjective assessments and objective behavior patterns. If established, these short-term assessments may be combined with other historical information on these animals, such as age, rearing history, the number of animals in the group, and the design of the exhibit, to aid in forming and maintaining multi-male gorilla groups in captivity.

Ultimately, the gorilla required surgical intervention for her disease and made a full recovery. To our knowledge, this is the only known case of spine surgery. A 36-year-old female human-habituated mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei), resident at the San Diego Zoo, was noticed by caregivers to walk with a substantial limp after being attacked by the gorilla troop's silverback male gorilla. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of her lumbar spine revealed a large herniated disk at the L1-2 level on the right. This finding appeared to correlate well with the gorilla's symptoms. The gorilla underwent a lumbar diskectomy under loupe. Post-operatively the gorilla did very well. The right leg weakness was immediately improved post-operatively. The gorilla continued to ""crutch walk"" initially, swinging on the upper extremities and not bearing weight on the lowers. However, by 2 weeks the limp was no longer noticeable to the zoo caregivers. The wound healed well and there was no evidence of wound infection or CSF leak. The gorilla was reunited with her troop and has reintegrated well socially. With 10 months of follow-up, the gorilla continues to do well. This is the only known case of spine surgery in a gorilla. For best surgical results, one needs to consider the similarities and differences between the gorilla and human vertebral anatomy. We believe that careful pre-operative planning contributed to the good early post-operative result. Ultimate assessment of the long-term outcome will require additional follow-up.

Structural variation of the monoamine oxidase A gene promoter repeat polymorphism in nonhuman primates,"['Wendland, JR', 'Hampe, M', 'Newman, TK', 'Syagailo, Y', 'Meyer, J', 'Schempp, W', 'Timme, A', 'Suomi, SJ', 'Lesch, KP']",GENES BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2005.00130.x,FEB 2006,16,"By conferring allele-specific transcriptional activity on the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene in humans, length variation of a repetitive sequence [(variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR)] in the MAOA promoter influences a constellation of personality traits related to aggressive and antisocial behavior and increases the risk of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Here, we have analyzed the presence and variability of this MAOA promoter repeat in several species of nonhuman primates. Sequence analysis of MAOA's transcriptional control region revealed the presence of the VNTR in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), bonobo (Pan paniscus), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and Gelada baboon (Theropithecus gelada). The majority of P. troglodytes and P. paniscus showed a single repeat with a sequence identical to the VNTR sequence in humans. In contrast, analyses of the remaining species revealed shorter sequences similar to the first 18 bp of human VNTR. Compared with other nonhuman primates, the VNTR sequence of M. mulatta showed the highest length variability with allele frequencies of 35, 25 and 40% for the five, six and seven repeat variants, respectively. The extent of variability of the MAOA promoter repeat in both rhesus monkeys and humans supports the notion that there may be a relationship between functional MAOA expression and aggression-related traits in humans and rhesus macaque populations."
Fixation of the human-specific CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase pseudogene and implications of haplotype diversity for human evolution,"['Hayakawa, T', 'Aki, I', 'Varki, A', 'Sattax, Y', 'Takahata, N']",GENETICS,10.1534/genetics.105.046995,FEB 2006,30,"The human CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase gene (CMAH) suffered deletion of an exon that encodes an active center for the enzyme similar to 3.2 million years ago (MYA). We analyzed a 7.3-kb intronic region of 132 CMAH genes to explore the fixation process of this pseudogene and the demographic implication of its haplotype diversity. Fifty-six variable sites were sorted into 18 different haplotypes with significant linkage disequilibrium. Despite the rather low nucleotide diversity, the most recent common ancestor at CMAH dates to 2.9 MYA. This deep genealogy follows shortly after the original exon deletion, indicating that the deletion has fixed in the population, although whether this fixation was facilitated by natural selection remains to be resolved. Remarkable features are exceptionally long persistence of two lineages and the confinement of one lineage in Africa, implying that some African local populations were in relative isolation while others were directly involved in multiple African exoduses of the genus Homo. Importantly, haplotypes found in Eurasia suggest interbreeding between then-contemporaneous human species. Although population structure within Africa complicates the interpretation of phylogeographic information of haplotypes, the data support a single origin of modern humans, but not with complete replacement of archaic inhabitants by modern humans."
"Identification by full-coverage array CGH of human DNA copy number increases relative to chimpanzee and gorilla
","['Wilson, GM', 'Flibotte, S', 'Missirlis, PI', 'Marra, MA', 'Jones, S', 'Thornton, K', 'Clark, AG', 'Holt, RA']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.4456006,FEB 2006,36,"Duplication of chromosomal segments and associated genes is thought to be a primary mechanism for generating evolutionary novelty. By comparative genome hybridization using a full-coverage (tiling) human BAC array with 79-kb resolution, we have identified 63 chromosomal segments, ranging in size from 0.65 to 1.3 Mb, that have inferred copy number increases in human relative to chimpanzee. These segments span 192 Ensembl genes, including 82 gene duplicates (41 reciprocal best BLAST matches). Synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates across these pairs provide evidence for general conservation of the amino acid sequence, consistent with the maintenance of function of both copies, and one case of putative positive selection for an uncharacterized gene. Surprisingly, the core histone genes H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 have been duplicated in the human lineage since our split with chimpanzee. The observation of increased copy number of a human cluster of core histone genes suggests that altered dosage, even of highly constrained genes, may be an important evolutionary mechanism."
Human F7 sequence is split into three deep clades that are related to FVII plasma levels,"['Sabater-Lleal, M', 'Soria, JM', 'Bertranpetit, J', 'Almasy, L', 'Blangero, J', 'Fontcuberta, J', 'Calafell, F']",HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s00439-005-0045-5,FEB 2006,11,"It is widely accepted that FVII levels are strongly, consistently, and independently related to cardiovascular risk. These levels are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Among the genetic factors, only a limited number of polymorphisms in the F7 gene have been reported, and they explain only a small proportion of the genetic variability. Recently, we have accomplished the complete dissection of the F7 quantitative trait locus responsible for all of the genetic variability observed in FVII levels. Now, we present the thorough study of the haplotype organization of F7 DNA sequence variation among individuals and the evolutionary processes that produced this variation, by sequencing 15 kb of genomic DNA sequence from the F7 locus in 40 unrelated individual (80 chromosomes) from the genetic analysis of idiopathic thrombophilia (GAIT) project as well as four non-human primate species. Our study revealed 49 polymorphisms, of which 39 SNPs were further considered. Genotyping of these DNA variations in the whole family-based GAIT sample helped resolve linkage phases, and a total of 37 distinct haplotypes were identified.

Tajima's D was significantly positive in this sample, suggesting balancing selection. This parameter was a reflection of the phylogenetic structure of F7 haplotype, which was deeply split into three well-supported clades or haplogroups, suggesting that functional differences among F7 variants do not depend on a few single-site variations. Moreover, haplogroup 2 was associated with high FVII levels and haplogroup 3 with low levels. In this study, we have for the first time established a clear relation between genotypic variability structure and phenotypic variability of a particular quantitative trait involved in a complex disease."
"Ape abundance and habitat use in the Goualougo Triangle, Republic of Congo","['Morgan, D', 'Sanz, C', 'Onononga, JR', 'Strindberg, S']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-005-9013-0,FEB 2006,42,"Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) populations in central Africa are rapidly declining as a result of disease epidemics, commercial bushmeat hunting, and habitat destruction. Our main objective was to estimate the absolute abundance and habitat utilization of chimpanzees and gorillas in the intact forests of the Goualougo Triangle in the Republic of Congo, and in an adjacent area in which selective logging will take place in the near future. The estimates provide a unique baseline for apes inhabiting an undisturbed environment. A second objective was to compare estimates of abundance and patterns of habitat utilization generated by different techniques: 1) distance sampling of individual ape nests and nest sites along line transects, 2) direct observations of apes during reconnaissance surveys, and 3) observations of ape traces during reconnaissance surveys. We completed a total of 222 km of line transect surveys in 4 sampling areas, resulting in overall density estimates of 1.53 chimpanzees/km(2) and 2.34 gorillas/km(2) from nest sites. We generated a density estimate of 2.23 chimpanzees/km(2) from direct observations during reconnaissance surveys of a semihabituated community in 1 of the 4 sampling areas. Habitat use profiles that nest surveys depicted on transects differed from those of direct observations and traces we encountered on reconnaissance surveys. We found the highest overall abundance of chimpanzee nests in monodominant Gilbertiodendron forest, whereas our direct observations showed that chimpanzees preferred mixed species forest. Transects that traversed the core area of the community range had the highest encounter rates of chimpanzee nests and nest sites. Gorilla nests on transects showed a preference only for mixed species forest with an open canopy, but direct observations and traces on reconnaissance surveys clearly indicated that gorillas use several habitat types. We conclude by evaluating the precision of these nest surveys and our ability to detect future trends in ape densities in the Goualougo Triangle."
Diet and mandibular morphology in African apes,"['Taylor, AB']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-005-9000-5,FEB 2006,19,"Investigations seeking to understand the relationship between mandibular form, function, and dietary behavior have focused on the mandibular corpus and symphysis. African apes vary along a gradient of folivory/frugivory, yet few studies have evaluated the morphology of the mandibular corpus and symphysis in these taxa, and the investigations have yielded mixed results. Specifically, studies using external metrics have identified differences in mandibular proportions that analysis of cortical bone distribution has not substantiated. I contribute to the ongoing debate on the relationship between jaw form and dietary behavior by comparing mandibular corporal and symphyseal shapes in African apes. Importantly, and in contrast to previous studies of African ape internal geometry, I include the Virunga mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), the ape most specialized toward a folivorous diet. I test the hypotheses that 1) Gorilla beringei beringei always has significantly more robust mandibular corpora and symphyses, relative to mandibular length, than all other African apes and 2) all gorillas have significantly more robust mandibular corpora and symphyses, relative to mandibular length, than Pan. Results demonstrate that the folivorous mountain gorillas consistently exhibit a relatively wider mandibular symphysis and corpus than all other African apes. Furthermore, all gorillas consistently exhibit relatively more robust mandibular corporal and symphyseal dimensions than Pan. The results indicate that among African apes, mountain gorillas are better able to counter lateral transverse bending (wishboning) loads at the symphysis and torsional loads at the corpus. All gorillas are likewise better able to resist wishboning and vertical bending at the symphysis, and sagittal bending and torsion at the corpus, than Pan, findings that are consistent with masticating relatively tougher foods, repetitive loading of the jaws, or both. I offer possible explanations for the lack of concordance in results between studies that have analyzed the biomechanical properties of African ape mandibles and others that have relied on external metrics. More comprehensive study of the internal geometry of the mandible is needed to resolve whether African apes differ morphologically in ways predicted by dietary variation."

Reproductive monitoring is required to improve breeding performances. Ultrasonography is a safe method to determine gestational age and to estimate the date of parturition. However only few data are available in nonhuman primates.

Methods Fetal biometric data were obtained throughout pregnancy on four African primate species, namely chimpanzee, gorilla, mandrill and patas monkey. Measurements included biparietal diameter, transverse abdominal diameter, femur and humerus length, external interorbital diameter, and fetal heart rate. Curves established from these data were compared with previously published data in chimpanzees and gorillas and with those for humans and other closely related primate species.

Results The curves for the different hominids were very similar, while those for mandrills more closely resembled baboons and data for patas monkeys were comparable to those for macaques.

Conclusions These data, by providing a tool to evaluate precise gestational age, will be useful for centers raising these four primate species."
Variable molecular clocks in hominoids,"['Elango, N', 'Thomas, JW', 'Yi, SV']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0510716103,JAN 31 2006,61,"Generation time is an important determinant of a neutral molecular clock. There are several human-specific life history traits that led to a substantially longer generation time in humans than in other hominoids. Indeed, a long generation time is considered an important trait that distinguishes humans from their closest relatives. Therefore, humans may exhibit a significantly slower molecular clock as compared to other hominoids. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed a large-scale analysis of lineage-specific rates of single-nucleotide substitutions among hominoids. We found that humans indeed exhibit a significant slowdown of molecular evolution compared to chimpanzees and other hominoids. However, the amount of fixed differences between humans and chimpanzees appears extremely small, suggesting a very recent evolution of human-specific life history traits. Notably, chimpanzees also exhibit a slower rate of molecular evolution compared to gorillas and orangutans in the regions analyzed."

Size and shape dimorphism in great ape mandibles and implications for fossil species recognition,"['Taylor, AB', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20266,JAN 2006,17,"Sexual dimorphism is an important source of morphological variation, and species differences in dimorphism may be reflected in magnitude, pattern, or both. While the extant great apes are commonly used as a reference sample for distinguishing between sexual dimorphism and intertaxic variation in the fossil record, few studies have evaluated mandibular dimorphism in these taxa. In this study, percentage, degree, and pattern of mandibular dimorphism are evaluated in Pongo, Gorilla, and Pan. Mandibular dimorphism patterns are explored to determine the extent to which such patterns accurately track great ape phylogeny. Pattern stability is assessed to determine whether there are stable patterns of mandibular size and shape dimorphism that may be usefully applied to hominoid or hominid fossil species recognition studies. Finally, the established patterns of dimorphism are used to address recent debates surrounding great ape taxonomy. Results demonstrate that mandibular dimorphism is universally expressed in size, but only Pongo and Gorilla exhibit shape dimorphism. Pattern similarity tends to be greater between subspecies of the same species than between higher-order taxa, suggesting that within the great apes, there is a relationship between dimorphism pattern and phylogeny. However, this relationship is not exact, given that dimorphism patterns are weakly correlated between some closely related taxa, while great ape subspecies may be highly correlated with taxa belonging to other species or genera. Furthermore, dimorphism patterns are not significantly correlated between great ape genera, even between Gorilla and Pan. Dimorphism patterns are more stable in Gorilla and Pongo as compared to Pan, but there is little pattern stability between species or genera. Importantly, few variables differ significantly between taxa that simultaneously show consistently relatively low levels of dimorphism and low levels of variation within taxa. Combined, these findings indicate that mandibular dimorphism patterns can and do vary considerably, even among closely related species, and suggest that it would be difficult to employ great ape mandibular dimorphism patterns for purposes of distinguishing between intra- and interspecies variation in fossil samples. Finally, the degree of pattern similarity in mandibular dimorphism is lower than previously observed by others for craniofacial dimorphism. Thus, the possibility cannot be ruled out that patterns of craniofacial dimorphism in great apes may be associated with a stronger phylogenetic signal than are patterns of mandibular dimorphism."

Pigs are frequently used as models for human diseases, and are also considered to be source animals for xenotransplantation to humans due to their anatomical and physiological similarities to humans. Therefore, in the present study, the genomic structure of the swine TAS1R3 gene was determined, and TAS1R3 expression was studied in various swine tissues. The gene was shown to reside on swine chromosome 6q22 -> q23, from which three types of mRNAs were generated: 3,752 bp derived from six exons in tongue, 3,704 bp from six exons and 3,630 bp from seven exons in testis. The 6 exons/5 introns were structurally similar to those of humans and mice, but the 7 exons/6 introns structure of TAS1R3 was first observed in swine. High expressions of TAS1R3 were revealed in tongue, kidney, and testis by real-time PCR. The expression profile of the tissues except for kidney was similar to that of mouse. When in situ hybridization using an RNA probe for TAS1R3 was performed on swine tongue and testis tissues, TAS1R3 expressions were revealed in tongue circumvallate papillae, fungiform papillae, mucosal epithelium, follicular B lymphocytes, lymphocytes in submucosal tissues of lingual tonsil, and spermatogenic cells. Using peripheral mature B lymphocytes, the expression of TAS1R3 in B lymphocytes was further confirmed by real-time PCR and sequencing of the real-time PCR product."

The possible existence of PCDH11 gene dosage differences between human and non-human primates is of evolutionary significance with respect to species differences and escape from X inactivation, and has been repeatedly debated. Previous investigations on the X/Y homologous status of PCDH11 and adjacent sequences in non-human primates have highlighted the complexity of the molecular pattern and evolutionary history of this genomic region.

"Identification, characterization and comparative genomics of chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses","['Polavarapu, N', 'Bowen, NJ', 'McDonald, JF']",GENOME BIOLOGY,10.1186/gb-2006-7-6-r51,2006,29,"Background: Retrotransposons, the most abundant and widespread class of eukaryotic transposable elements, are believed to play a significant role in mutation and disease and to have contributed significantly to the evolution of genome structure and function. The recent sequencing of the chimpanzee genome is providing an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional significance of these elements in two closely related primate species and to better evaluate their role in primate evolution.

Results: We report here that the chimpanzee genome contains at least 42 separate families of endogenous retroviruses, nine of which were not previously identified. All but two (CERV 1/PTERV1 and CERV 2) of the 42 families of chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses were found to have orthologs in humans. Molecular analysis (PCR and Southern hybridization) of CERV 2 elements demonstrates that this family is present in chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and old-world monkeys but absent in human, orangutan and new-world monkeys. A survey of endogenous retroviral positional variation between chimpanzees and humans determined that approximately 7% of all chimpanzee-human INDEL variation is associated with endogenous retroviral sequences.

Conclusion: Nine families of chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses have been transpositionally active since chimpanzees and humans diverged from a common ancestor. Seven of these transpositionally active families have orthologs in humans, one of which has also been transpositionally active in humans since the human-chimpanzee divergence about six million years ago. Comparative analyses of orthologous regions of the human and chimpanzee genomes have revealed that a significant portion of INDEL variation between chimpanzees and humans is attributable to endogenous retroviruses and may be of evolutionary significance."

Here we present the analysis of the length distribution of all 10 nonredundant trinucleotide repeat motifs in 20 complete eukaryotic genomes (6 mammalian, 2 nonmammalian vertebrates, 4 arthropods, 4 fungi, and I each of nematode, amoebozoa, alveolate, and plant), which showed that the abundance of large expansions of GAA trinucleotide repeats is specific to mammals. Analysis of human-chimpanzee-gorilla orthologs revealed that loci with large expansions are species-specific and have occurred after divergence from the common ancestor. PCR analysis of human controls revealed large expansions at multiple human (GAA)301 loci; nine loci showed expanded alleles containing > 65 triplets, analogous to disease-causing expansions in Friedreich ataxia, including two that are in introns of genes of unknown function. The abundance of long GAA trinucleotide repeat tracts in mammalian genomes represents a significant mutation potential and source of interindividual variability. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

A contact algorithm for density-based load estimation,"['Bona, MA', 'Martin, LD', 'Fischer, KJ']",JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2005.01.006,2006,5,"An algorithm, which includes contact interactions within a joint, has been developed to estimate the dominant loading patterns in joints based on the density distribution of bone. The algorithm is applied to the proximal femur of a chimpanzee, gorilla and grizzly bear and is compared to the results obtained in a companion paper that uses a non-contact (linear) version of the density-based load estimation method. Results from the contact algorithm are consistent with those from the linear method. While the contact algorithm is substantially more complex than the linear method, it has some added benefits. First, since contact between the two interacting surfaces is incorporated into the load estimation method, the pressure distributions selected by the method are more likely indicative of those found in vivo. Thus, the pressure distributions predicted by the algorithm are more consistent with the in vivo loads that were responsible for producing the given distribution of bone density. Additionally, the relative positions of the interacting bones are known for each pressure distribution selected by the algorithm. This should allow the pressure distributions to be related to specific types of activities. The ultimate goal is to develop a technique that can predict dominant joint loading patterns and relate these loading patterns to specific types of locomotion and/or activities.

"How the great apes (Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, Pan paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla) perform on the reversed contingency task: The effects of food quantity and food visibility","['Vlamings, PHJM', 'Uher, J', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-ANIMAL BEHAVIOR PROCESSES,10.1037/0097-7403.32.1.60,JAN 2006,41,"S. T. Boysen and G. G. Berntson (1995) found that chimpanzees performed poorly on a reversed contingency task in which they had to point to the smaller of 2 food quantities to acquire the larger quantity. The authors compared the performance of 4 great ape species (Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, Pan paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla) on the reversed contingency task while manipulating food quantity (0-4 or 1-4) and food visibility (visible pairs or covered pairs). Results showed no systematic species differences but large individual differences. Some individuals of each species were able to solve the reversed contingency task. Both quantity and visibility of the food items had a significant effect on performance. Subjects performed better when the disparity between quantities was smaller and the quantities were not directly visible."
Dental microwear and diets of African early Homo,"['Ungar, PS', 'Grine, FE', 'Teaford, MF', 'El Zaatari, S']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.08.007,JAN 2006,50,"Conventional wisdom ties the origin and early evolution of the genus Homo to environmental changes that occurred near the end of the Pliocene. The basic idea is that changing habitats led to new diets emphasizing savanna resources, such as herd mammals or underground storage organs. Fossil teeth provide the most direct evidence available for evaluating this theory. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of dental microwear in Plio-Pleistocene Homo from Africa. We examined all available cheek teeth from Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, and South Africa and found 18 that preserved antemortem microwear. Microwear features were measured and compared for these specimens and a baseline series of five extant primate species (Cebus apella, Gorilla gorilla, Lophocebus albigena, Pan troglodytes, and Papio ursinus) and two protohistoric human foraging groups (Aleut and Arikara) with documented differences in diet and subsistence strategies. Results confirmed that dental microwear reflects diet, such that hard-object specialists tend to have more large microwear pits, whereas tough food eaters usually have more striations and smaller microwear features. Early Homo specimens clustered with baseline groups that do not prefer fracture resistant foods. Still, Homo erectus and individuals from Swartkrans Member I had more small pits than Homo habilis and specimens from Sterkfontein Member 5C. These results suggest that none of the early Homo groups specialized on very hard or tough foods, but that H. erectus and Swartkrans Member 1 individuals ate, at least occasionally, more brittle or tough items than other fossil hominins studied.

Inventory of large and medium-sized mammals in south-western Cameroon,"['Matthews, A', 'Matthews, A']",MAMMALIA,10.1515/MAMM.2006.041,2006,0,"The results of an inventory of large and medium-sized mammals in the Campo and Ma'an Forests in southwestern Cameroon are presented. In 24 months between 1997 and 2000, observations of live animals, tracks, faeces and night nests of apes were recorded on a total of 665.5 km of line transects. The presence of 33 species, including 12 diurnal and three nocturnal primate species, eight ungulates and five carnivores, was confirmed. Hunters confirmed the occurrence of 15 additional species. In the Campo Forest, the species diversity and density of most mammals were higher than in the Ma'an Forest, although a large part of the Campo Forest has been logged. Only three guenon species and chimpanzees were found at the same or even higher densities in the as yet unlogged Ma'an Forest. Gorillas, elephants, buffaloes and mangabeys were extremely rare in the Ma'an Forest. High hunting pressure in the Ma'an Forest seems to have led to a drastic population decline for most species. In the Campo Forest, mammal densities were lower in the northern and western parts of the area subjected to high levels of habitat destruction by logging and hunting than in the less exploited southern and eastern areas of the logging concession and within the National Park."

The role of taste in food selection by African apes: implications for niche separation and overlap in tropical forests,"['Remis, MJ']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-005-0145-9,JAN 2006,7,"Ripe fruit eating shapes the behavior of most of the apes. Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are very different sizes and, consequently, have been traditionally viewed as ecologically distinct, but few studies have explored the behavioral and physiological foundations of their diets. Debate continues on the extent that large-bodied gorillas may be less selective and more opportunistic fruit eaters than chimpanzees. Taste responses have been predicted to relate to body size and digestive strategies. This study employs laboratory research on taste perception and discrimination among captive zoo-housed chimpanzees and relates it to previous work on gorillas to better characterize diets and niche separation among these apes. During the captive trials, differences were recorded in consumption patterns of water and varying concentrations of dilute aqueous fructose (sweet), and tannic acid solutions (astringent), compounds commonly found in wild foods. The chimpanzees exhibited similar preference thresholds for fructose (50 mM) to other primates studied. They exhibited slightly lower inhibition thresholds for tannic acid solutions than gorillas, but higher than smaller primates studied to date. These preliminary findings suggest that tannin tolerance may well be mediated by body size, though possible species differences in salivary proteins or other sensory differences remain to be explored. This research furthers our efforts to understand the roles of body size and physiological adaptations in shaping diet and niche separation of chimpanzees and gorillas."
Diet and seasonal changes in sympatric gorillas and chimpanzees at Kahuzi-Biega National Park,"['Yamagiwa, J', 'Basabose, AK']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-005-0147-7,JAN 2006,28,"Based on 8 years of observations of a group of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri) and a unit-group of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) living sympatrically in the montane forest at Kahuzi-Biega National Park, we compared their diet and analyzed dietary overlap between them in relation to fruit phenology. Data on fruit consumption were collected mainly from fecal samples, and phenology of preferred ape fruits was estimated by monitoring. Totals of 231 plant foods (116 species) and 137 plant foods (104 species) were recorded for gorillas and chimpanzees, respectively. Among these, 38% of gorilla foods and 64% of chimpanzee foods were eaten by both apes. Fruits accounted for the largest overlap between them (77% for gorillas and 59% for chimpanzees). Gorillas consumed more species of vegetative foods (especially bark) exclusively whereas chimpanzees consumed more species of fruits and animal foods exclusively. Although the number of fruit species available in the montane forest of Kahuzi is much lower than that in lowland forest, the number of fruit species per chimpanzee fecal sample (average 2.7 species) was similar to that for chimpanzees in the lowland habitats. By contrast, the number of fruit species per gorilla fecal sample (average 0.8 species) was much lower than that for gorillas in the lowland habitats. Fruit Consumption by both apes tended to increase during the dry season when ripe fruits were more abundant in their habitat. However, the number of fruit species consumed by chimpanzees did not change according to ripe fruit abundance. The species differences in fruit consumption may be attributed to the wide ranging of gorillas and repeated usage of a small range by chimpanzees and/or to avoidance of inter-specific contact by chimpanzees. The different staple foods (leaves and bark for gorillas and fig fruits for chimpanzees) characterize the dietary divergence between them in the montane forest of Kahuzi, where fruit is usually scarce. Gorillas rarely fed on insects, but chimpanzees occasionally fed on bees with honey, which possibly compensate for fruit scarcity. A comparison of dietary overlap between gorillas and chimpanzees across I habitats suggests that sympatry may not influence dietary overlap in fruit consumed but may stimulate behavioral divergence to reduce feeding competition between them."
The behavioral ecology of sympatric African apes: implications for understanding fossil hominoid ecology,"['Stanford, CB']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-005-0148-6,JAN 2006,18,"The behavioral ecology of the great apes is key evidence used in the reconstruction of the behavior of extinct ape and hominid taxa. Chimpanzees and gorillas have been studied in detail in the wild, and some studies of their behavioral ecology in sympatry have, also been been carried out. Although the two ape species have divergent behavior and ecology in important respects, recent studies have shown that the interspecific differences are not as stark as previously thought and subsequently urge new consideration of how they share forest resources when sympatric. These new data require re-examination of assumptions about key aspects of chimpanzee-gorilla ecological divergence, such as diet, ranging and nesting patterns, and the mating system. Diet is a key component of the species' adaptive complexes that facilitates avoidance of direct competition from the other. While the nutritional basis for chimpanzee food choice remains unclear and no doubt varies from site to site, this species is a ripe fruit specialist and ranges farther during periods of ripe fruit scarcity. Gorillas in the same habitat also feed on ripe fruit when widely available, but fall back onto fibrous plant foods during lean periods. The inclusion of animal protein in the diet of the chimpanzees and its absence in that of the gorillas also distinguish the species ecologically. It may also offer clues to aspects of ecological divergence among early members of the hominid phylogeny. The paper concludes by suggesting likely characteristics of sympatric associations of Pliocene hominids, based oil field data from extant sympatric apes."
"Is the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes an endangered species? It depends on what ""endangered"" means","['Oates, JF']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-005-0149-5,JAN 2006,25,"I review information on the status in the wild of the robust chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, and consider whether this evidence is consistent with the designation of P. troglodytes as Endangered in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List, and with public statements to the effect that great apes as a whole will be extinct within a few decades. Chimpanzees remain widespread in tropical Africa, occurring in a variety of forested habitats. Estimates of total surviving numbers have increased from about 200,000 in the 1980s to a maximum of almost 300,000 in 2003. However, this apparent increase comes about from new survey data, rather than representing a measured increase in actual population numbers. Infectious disease decimated several chimpanzee populations during the 1990s, and data from parts of Gabon, extrapolated to that country as a whole, suggest a major decline in great ape populations caused by disease and hunting. However, accurate data on population numbers are absent for the majority of wild chimpanzee Populations. I found reports of the presence of Pan troglodytes in at least 51 national parks in at least 19 countries; some of these parks have been established very recently. Chimpanzees also occur in many non-park conservation areas. A set of large, well-protected parks could safeguard chimpanzees for the foreseeable future. Although many African parks do not function well at present, mechanisms to improve their function are understood and available. By a strict application of IUCN threat criteria, P. troglodytes can be considered Endangered, based on estimated rates of past decline and on the species' long generation time. Relatively speaking, however, P. troglodytes is less endangered than are orangutans or gorillas, and the species is unlikely to go extinct by the year 2100, especially if existing conservation measures improve. The IUCN threat-rating system has become overly complex; the system can produce results that do not accord with common sense and these results must therefore be interpreted with care."
"Toward an excremental posthumanism: Primatology, women, and waste","['Lathers, M']",SOCIETY & ANIMALS,10.1163/156853006778882439,2006,0,"This essay assesses the use of excrement as a cultural trope in a posthumanist era. Drawing on insights from feminist, postcolonial, and animal theory, it proposes that Fossey (1983) and the film Gorillas in the Mist (1988) are popularized versions of a recurring narrative that posits feces as a sign of the both material and symbolic fluid boundaries between human and nonhuman animals, colonizers and natives, men and women, and science and nature. Specifically, Gorillas in the Mist transposes Fossey's study of gorilla ""dung"" in the jungle, the essay demonstrates, as a repetition of the enunciation ""shit:"" In both written and spoken form, excrement mediates between, and ultimately merges, the identities of Fossey and the mountain gorillas. In the conclusion, the essay raises some problems in theorizing the relationship between postcolonial and posthumanist theory."

Natural hybridization in primates: One evolutionary mechanism,"['Arnold, ML', 'Meyer, A']",ZOOLOGY,10.1016/j.zool.2006.03.006,2006,78,"The role and importance of natural hybridization in the evolutionary histories of animal taxa is still debated. This results largely from a history of zoological investigations that assumed, rather than documented, a limited evolutionary role for this process. However, it is now becoming apparent that, just as for plants, the creative effects of reticulate evolution are widespread in animal taxa as well. This conclusion is supported by the documentation of numerous instances of the formation of new taxa and the genetic enrichment through introgressive hybridization. In the present review, we use primates as a paradigm for how natural hybridization can affect the evolution of species complexes and remains a footprint on genomes. Findings for a number of groups, including basal (e.g. lemurs) and derived (e.g. Old World apes) lineages, demonstrate that introgression and hybrid speciation have caused a reticulate pattern that is still detectable in the, often mosaic, genomes of primates. For example, results from genetic analyses of our own species demonstrate the process of past introgressive hybridization with the progenitors of our sister taxa (i.e. chimpanzees and gorillas) and most likely also our extinct, close relatives in the hominid lineage.

We have identified 2762 SVA elements from the human genome draft sequence. Genomic distribution analysis indicates that the SVA elements are enriched in G+C-rich regions but have no preferences for inter- or intragenic regions. A phylogenetic analysis of the elements resulted in the recovery of six subfamilies that were named SVA_A to SVA_F. The composition, age and genomic distribution of the subfamilies have been examined. Subfamily age estimates based upon nucleotide divergence indicate that the expansion of four SVA subfamilies (SVA_A, SVA_B, SVA_C and SVA_D) began before the divergence of human, chimpanzee and gorilla, while subfamilies SVA_E and SVA_F are restricted to the human lineage. A survey of human genomic diversity associated with SVA_E and SVA_F subfamily members showed insertion polymorphism frequencies of 37.5% and 27.6%, respectively. In addition, we examined the amplification dynamics of SVA elements throughout the primate order and traced their origin back to the beginnings of hominid primate evolution, approximately 18 to 25 million years ago. This makes SVA elements the youngest family of retroposons in the primate order. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Human specific AluY element was identified on human chromosome 21q22 (accession no. AL163282), and then that was a new member of AluYj subfamily. From the bio-informatic analysis, AluYj subfamily was investigated in human whole genome using AluYj4 consensus sequence (accession no. AL163282). Thirteen members of the AluYj4 elements (4 diagnostic mutations) and eight members of the AluYj3 elements (3 diagnostic mutations) were identified with distinct diagnostic mutation from AluY consensus sequence. The results of the molecular clock calculation of non-CpG region substitution indicated that, AluYj4 elements (2.1 million years old) may be proliferated more recent time than AluYj3 elements (14.1 million years old). For the verification of recent insertion time, four of AluYj4 elements (ch2-AC017101, ch10-AC044786, chl2-AC007656 and ch21-AL163282) from human chromosomes 2, 10, 12, 21 were analyzed by PCR amplification using various human and primate DNA samples.

Mandibular symphysis of large-bodied hominoids,"['Sherwood, RJ', 'Hlusko, LJ', 'Duren, DL', 'Emch, VC', 'Walker, A']",HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1353/hub.2006.0020,DEC 2005,9,"The hominoid mandibular symphysis has received a great deal of attention from anatomists, human biologists, and paleontologists. Much of this research has focused on functional interpretations of symphyseal shape variation. Here, we examine the two-dimensional cross-sectional shape of the adult mandibular symphysis for 45 humans, 42 chimpanzees, 37 gorillas, and 51 orangutans using eigenshape analysis, an outline-based morphometric approach. Our results demonstrate that a large proportion of the variation described by the first eigenshape correlates with proposed functional adaptations to counteract stresses at the mandibular midline during mastication. Subsequent eigenshapes describe subtle aspects of shape variation in the mandibular symphysis. The morphology associated with these eigenshapes does not conform with functional predictions, nor does it show a relationship with sexual dimorphism. However, eigenshapes provide for considerable taxonomic discrimination between the four taxa studied and may consequently prove useful in the analysis of fossil material. Comparison with elliptical Fourier analysis of the mandibular symphysis identifies eigenshape analysis as providing superior taxonomic discrimination. The results presented here demonstrate that the cross-sectional shape of the mandibular symphysis results from a complex interplay of functional and nonfunctional influences and for the first time identifies and quantifies the specific aspects of variation attributable to these factors."
"Diet of Grauer's gorillas in the montane forest of Kahuzi, Democratic Republic of Congo","['Yamagiwa, J', 'Basabose, AK', 'Kaleme, K', 'Yumoto, T']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-005-8856-8,DEC 2005,9,"We describe the diet of a semihabituated group of Grauer's gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri) inhabiting the montane forest of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, Democratic Republic of Congo, based on direct observations, feeding remains in their fresh trails, and fecal samples collected over 9 yr. We examined fruit availability in their habitat; consumption of fruit, vegetative, and animal food; and daily intake of vegetative plant food using a transect, fruit monitoring trails, fecal analysis, and tracing of the animal's daily trails between consecutive nest sites. The fruit food repertoire of Kahuzi gorillas resembles that of western and eastern lowland gorillas inhabiting lowland tropical forests, while their vegetative food repertoire resembles that of mountain gorillas inhabiting montane forests. Among 236 plant foods (116 species), leaves, pith, and barks constitute the major parts (70.2%), with fruit making up the minor part (19.7%). About half (53.2%) of the total fecal samples included fruit remains. The gorillas used leaves, stems and other vegetative plant parts as staples. Their fruit intake was similar to that reported for mountain gorillas in Bwindi. They ate animal foods, including earthworms, on rare occasions. Variation in fruit consumption was positively associated with variation in fruit production. The gorillas ate fig fruits frequently; fig intake is positively correlated with that of other fruits, and figs were not fallback foods. They relied heavily on bamboo shoots on a seasonal basis; however, no bamboo shoots were available for several years after a major flowering event. Our results support the argument that variation in gorilla diets mostly reflects variation in vegetational composition of their habitats."

A new method of dental microwear analysis: Application to extant primates and Ouranopithecus macedoniensis (Late Miocene of Greece),"['Merceron, G', 'Blondel, C', 'De Bonis, L', 'Koufos, GD', 'Viriot, L']",PALAIOS,10.2110/palo.2004.p04-17,DEC 2005,56,"This study presents a new, reliable method of dental microwear analysis, which is applied to one of the largest published primate databases and to a Miocene hominoid, Ouranopithecus macedoniensis. Phase I and phase II molar facets were considered. A strict protocol during the molding and casting steps enabled the capture of sharp photographs using light stereomicroscopy. A semi-automatic method allows the quantification of the microwear features on digitized photographs.

Inter-specific analysis on extant primates enabled recognition of three clusters. Primates feeding on soft fruits and leaves and having a low incidence of pitting on molar facets constitute the first cluster. A second group composed of the three sub-species of Papio, differs from the others by a high incidence of pitting and scratching on both molar facets. This is related to the consumption of abrasive graminoids and hard items. Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Pongo pygmaeus have an intermediate microwear pattern and constitute a third group. Ouranopithecus macedoniensis is close in dental microwear pattern to the three sub-species of Papio. This suggests the importance of the consumption of hard and abrasive items. Intra-specific analysis of dental microwear variations within a population of Pongo pygmaeus reveals no significant differences related to sex and molar-wear stage. According to these results, this alternative method appears to be repeatable, and therefore reliable, for paleodiet characterization of fossil primates."
Sexual dimorphism in the Japanese cranial base: A Fourier-wavelet representation,"['Lestrel, PE', 'Cesar, RM', 'Takahashi, O', 'Kanazawa, E']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20209,NOV 2005,10,"An approach, computational shape analysis (CSA), is presented here which utilizes a Fourier-wavelet representation to numerically describe shape features of biological forms. Two elements are involved: 1) elliptical Fourier functions (EFFs), to provide estimates of global aspects, and 2) continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) to generate an objective estimate of localized features. EFFs are computed, using a set of pseudo-homologous points, to create a precise analog of the boundary. This computed contour is then normalized by scaling and rotated in two-dimensional space to insure a representation that is invariant with respect to starting point, size, and orientation. The predicted point coordinates derived from the EFFs are submitted to CWT for further processing. Wavelet coefficients are then computed to identify localized features, localization being a subjective process with EFFs. The advantage of wavelets is that they eliminate the inevitable subjectivity inherent in the choice of measurements. To test the usefulness of CSA, a sample of cranial base (CB) lateral radiographic outlines was available. Five archaeological periods, Yayoi, Kofun, Kamakura, Edo, and Modern, were utilized (n = 297). Statistically significant differences in sex and archaeological age were found. Although archaeological age differences were present, they were small and random in character, suggesting stability in the CB structures. In contrast, sexually dimorphic differences were present in every group from the Yayoi to the Modern period. This presence of sexually dimorphic differences in shape was consistent with earlier studies of M. nemestrina, G. gorilla, and R troglodytes. Consequently, it is suggested that the pattern of sexual dimorphism documented in the Japanese CB is a primate pattern with an ancient evolutionary history. The results demonstrate, both visually and numerically, that CSA is a powerful approach for describing both global and localized features of craniofacial structures such as the CB."
Knuckle-walking anteater: A convergence test of adaptation for purported knuckle-walking features of African hominidae,"['Orr, CM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20192,NOV 2005,24,"Appeals to synapomorphic features of the wrist and hand in African apes, early hominins, and modern humans as evidence of knuckle-walking ancestry for the hominin lineage rely on accurate interpretations of those features as adaptations to knuckle-walking locomotion. Because Gorilla, Pan, and Homo share a relatively close common ancestor, the interpretation of such features is confounded somewhat by phylogeny. The study presented here examines the evolution of a similar locomotor regime in New World anteaters (order Xenarthra, family Myrmecophagidae) and uses the terrestrial giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) as a convergence test of adaptation for purported knuckle-walking features of the Hominidae. During the stance phase of locomotion, Myrmecophaga transmits loads through flexed digits and a vertical Manus, with hyperextension occurring at the metacarpophalangeal joints of the weight-bearing rays. This differs fro the locomotion of smaller, arboreal anteaters of outgroup genera Tamandua and Cyclopes that employ extended wrist postures during above-branch quadrupedality. A number of features shared by Myrmecophaga, and Pan and Gorilla facilitate load transmission or limit extension, thereby stabilizing the wrist and hand during knuckle-walking, and distinguish these taxa from their respective outgroups. These traits are a distally extended dorsal ridge of the distal radius, proximal expansion of the nonarticular surface of the dorsal capitate, a pronounced articular ridge on the dorsal aspects of the load-bearing metacarpal heads, and metacarpal heads that are wider dorsally than volarly. Only the proximal expansion of the nonarticular area of the dorsal capitate distinguishes knuckle-walkers from digitigrade cercopithecids, but features shared with digitigrade primates might be adaptive to the use of a vertical Manus of some sort in the stance phase of terrestrial locomotion. The appearance of capitate nonarticular expansion and the dorsal ridge of the distal radius in the hominin lineage might be indicative of a knuckle-walking ancestry for bipedal hominins if interpreted within the biomechanical and phylogenetic context of hominid locomotor evolution."
Dental microwear variability on buccal tooth enamel surfaces of extant catarrhini and the miocene fossil Dryopithecus laietanus (Hominoidea),"['Galbany, J', 'Moya-Sola, S', 'Perez-Perez, A']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000089531,2005,11,"Analyses of buccal tooth microwear have been used to trace dietary habits of modern hunter-gatherer populations. In these populations, the average density and length of striations on the buccal surfaces of teeth are significantly correlated with the abrasive potential of food items consumed. In non-human primates, tooth microwear patterns on both occlusal and buccal wear facets have been thoroughly studied and the results applied to the characterization of dietary habits of fossil species. In this paper, we present inter- and intra-specific buccal microwear variability analyses in extant Cercopithecoidea (Cercopithecus mitis, C. neglectus, Chlorocebus aethiops, Colobus spp., Papio anubis) and Hominoidea (Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus). The results are tentatively compared to buccal microwear patterns of the Miocene fossils Dryopithecus and Oreopithecus. Significant differences in striation density and length are found among the fossil taxa studied and the extant primates, suggesting that buccal microwear can be used to identify dietary differences among taxa. The Dryopithecus buccal microwear pattern most closely resembles that of abrasive, tough plant foods consumers, such as the gorilla, in contrast to studies of dental morphology that suggest a softer, frugivorous diet. Results for Oreopithecus were equivocal, but suggest a more abrasive diet than that previously thought."

We used magnetic resonance images of the living brains of 10 human and 17 ape subjects to obtain volumetric estimates of regions of interest. We parcellated the white matter in the frontal and temporal lobes into two sectors, including the white matter immediately underlying the cortex (gyral white matter) and the rest of white matter (core). We outlined the dorsal, mesial, and orbital subdivisions of the frontal lobe and analyzed the relationship between cortex and gyral white matter within each subdivision.

For all regions analyzed, the observed human values are as large as expected, with the exception of the gyral white matter, which is larger than expected in humans. We found that orangutans had a relatively smaller orbital sector than any other great ape species, with no overlap in individual values. We found that the relative size of the dorsal subdivision is larger in chimpanzees than in bonobos, and that the ratio of gyral white matter to cortex stands out in Pan in comparison to Gorilla and Pongo. Individual variability, possible sex differences, and hemispheric asymmetries were present not only in humans, but in apes as well.

Differences in the distribution of neural connectivity and cortical sectors were identified among great ape species that share similar absolute brain sizes. Given that these regions are part of neural systems with distinct functional attributes, we suggest that the observed differences may reflect different evolutionary pressures on regulatory mechanisms of complex cognitive functions, including social cognition.

A 3D quantitative comparison of trapezium and trapezoid relative articular and nonarticular surface areas in modern humans and great apes,"['Tocheri, MW', 'Razdan, A', 'Williams, RC', 'Marzke, MW', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.06.005,NOV 2005,32,"The structure and functions of the modern human hand are critical components of what distinguishes Homo sapiens from the great apes (Gorilla, Pan, and Pongo). In this study, attention is focused on the trapezium and trapezoid, the two most lateral bones of the distal carpal row, in the four extant hominid genera, representing the first time they have been quantified and analyzed together as a morphological-functional complex. Our objective is to quantify the relative articular and nonarticular surface areas of these two bones and to test whether modern humans exhibit significant shape differences from the great apes, as predicted by previous qualitative analyses and the functional demands of differing manipulative and locomotor strategies. Modern humans were predicted to show larger relative first metacarpal and scaphoid surfaces on the trapezium because of the regular recruitment of the thumb during manipulative behaviors; alternatively, great apes were predicted to show larger relative second metacarpal and scaphoid surfaces on the trapezoid because of the functional demands on the hands during locomotor behaviors. Modern humans were also expected to exhibit larger relative mutual joint surfaces between the trapezoid and adjacent carpals than do the great apes because of assumed transverse loads generated by the functional demands of the modern human power grip. Using 3D bone models acquired through laser digitizing, the relative articular and nonarticular areas on each bone are quantified and compared. Multivariate analyses of these data clearly distinguish modern humans from the great apes. In total, the observed differences between modern humans and the great apes support morphological predictions based on the fact that this region of the human wrist is no longer involved in weight-bearing during locomotor behavior and is instead recruited solely for manipulative behaviors. The results provide the beginnings of a 3D comparative standard against which further extant and fossil primate wrist bones can be compared within the contexts of manipulative and locomotor behaviors.

Wave-like spread of Ebola Zaire,"['Walsh, PD', 'Biek, R', 'Real, LA']",PLOS BIOLOGY,10.1371/journal.pbio.0030371,NOV 2005,69,"In the past decade the Zaire strain of Ebola virus (ZEBOV) has emerged repeatedly into human populations in central Africa and caused massive die-offs of gorillas and chimpanzees. We tested the view that emergence events are independent and caused by ZEBOV variants that have been long resident at each locality. Phylogenetic analyses place the earliest known outbreak at Yambuku, Democratic Republic of Congo, very near to the root of the ZEBOV tree, suggesting that viruses causing all other known outbreaks evolved from a Yambuku-like virus after 1976. The tendency for earlier outbreaks to be directly ancestral to later outbreaks suggests that outbreaks are epidemiologically linked and may have occurred at the front of an advancing wave. While the ladder-like phylogenetic structure could also bear the signature of positive selection, our statistical power is too weak to reach a conclusion in this regard. Distances among outbreaks indicate a spread rate of about 50 km per year that remains consistent across spatial scales. Viral evolution is clocklike, and sequences show a high level of small-scale spatial structure. Genetic similarity decays with distance at roughly the same rate at all spatial scales. Our analyses suggest that ZEBOV has recently spread across the region rather than being long persistent at each outbreak locality. Controlling the impact of Ebola on wild apes and human populations may be more feasible than previously recognized."
First observation of tool use in wild gorillas,"['Breuer, T', 'Ndoundou-Hockemba, M', 'Fishlock, V']",PLOS BIOLOGY,10.1371/journal.pbio.0030380,NOV 2005,67,"Descriptions of novel tool use by great apes in response to different circumstances aids us in understanding the factors favoring the evolution of tool use in humans. This paper documents what we believe to be the first two observations of tool use in wild western gorillas ( Gorilla gorilla). We first observed an adult female gorilla using a branch as a walking stick to test water deepness and to aid in her attempt to cross a pool of water at Mbeli Bai, a swampy forest clearing in northern Congo. In the second case we saw another adult female using a detached trunk from a small shrub as a stabilizer during food processing. She then used the trunk as a self-made bridge to cross a deep patch of swamp. In contrast to information from other great apes, which mostly show tool use in the context of food extraction, our observations show that in gorillas other factors such as habitat type can stimulate the use of tools."

Recent findings indicated an increasing importance of AE for non-human primates living in regions endemic for E. multilocularis. The death of five cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and a lowland gorilla (Gorilla g. gorilla) due to A-E raised concern about the incidence of this parasite in the Basle Zoo. Consequently, a project was initiated to investigate the prevalence amongst an affected group of cynomolgus monkeys, as well as in foxes and mice. Three out of 46 monkeys were seropositive for E. multilocularis antigen. In two of these monkeys and in another three animals, which were seronegative, structures compatible with metacestodal cysts were observed using ultrasonography. Seven out of 35 free roaming foxes caught at the zoo were positive for an intestinal E. multilocularis copro-antigen ELISA, four of them shed taeniid eggs simultaneously. No lesions compatible with AE were present in 50 necropsied mice from the zoo area. These results indicate that the fox population is a potential source to introduce E. multilocularis and may thus represent a risk for the zoo animals."

There is also evidence that chimpanzees modify the types of communicative signals they use depending on the attentional state of a human communicative partner. The majority of previous studies have involved chimpanzees requesting food items from a human experimenter. Here, these same communicative behaviors are reported in chimpanzees requesting a tool from a human observer. In this study, captive chimpanzees were found to gesture, vocalize, and display more often when the experimenter had a tool than when she did not. It was also found that chimpanzees responded differentially based on the attentional state of a human experimenter, and when given the wrong tool persisted in their communicative efforts. Implications for the referential and intentional nature of chimpanzee communicative signaling are discussed."
Ranger based monitoring in the Virunga-Bwindi region of east-central Africa: A simple data collection tool for park management,"['Gray, M', 'Kalpers, J']",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,10.1007/s10531-005-8406-x,OCT 2005,30,"Effective management of protected areas is dependent on information on the illegal and legal use of the habitat by people, the ecological and behavioural needs of key species, and trends in resource availability and ecological processes. The International Gorilla Conservation Programme working with the protected area authorities in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo has developed a ranger based monitoring system, using basic protocols for data collection that guide protected area staff in park management. This programme is a key management tool for the three park authorities responsible for the conservation of the mountain gorilla ( Gorilla beringei beringei) in the Virunga and Bwindi forest blocks. The programme was initiated in 1997 and has enabled the gathering of extensive information on illegal activities, key species of fauna and. ora, and habituated and unhabituated groups of gorillas. Ranger based monitoring is a simple and cost effective tool that can be sustained in the parks in the Virunga-Bwindi region with limited external support. It provides park managers with information that prompts appropriate responses to threats to the ecosystem. For example information on the distribution of illegal activities determines targeted patrol coverage to address specific threats. The bottom-up approach of ranger based monitoring includes a strong capacity building component and empowers field staff in park management activities."

Factors influencing the distribution of large mammals within a protected central African forest,"['Blom, A', 'van Zalinge, R', 'Heitkonig, IMA', 'Prins, HHT']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605305001080,OCT 2005,30,"This paper presents the analyses of data obtained from eight permanent 20 km transects to determine the relative effect of local human populations and ecological factors on the distribution of large mammals within the Dzanga sector of the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park and the adjacent area of the Dzanga-Sangha Dense Forest Special Reserve in south-west Central African Republic. Principal component analysis indicated that human activities significantly influence the distribution of large mammals, even within this protected area. Distance from the village and the main road as well as the distance from secondary roads appeared to have the greatest influence. Elephants in particular were significantly less common in areas related to human use. Our study showed that poachers use roads, both primary and secondary, to penetrate into the National Park. Thus increasing anti-poaching efforts along these roads could be an effective protection measure."
The axon guidance receptor gene ROBO1 is a candidate gene for developmental dyslexia,"['Hannula-Jouppi, K', 'Kaminen-Ahola, N', 'Taipale, M', 'Eklund, R', 'Nopola-Hemmi, J', 'Kaariainen, H', 'Kere, J']",PLOS GENETICS,10.1371/journal.pgen.0010050,OCT 2005,162,"Dyslexia, or specific reading disability, is the most common learning disorder with a complex, partially genetic basis, but its biochemical mechanisms remain poorly understood. A locus on Chromosome 3, DYX5, has been linked to dyslexia in one large family and speech-sound disorder in a subset of small families. We found that the axon guidance receptor gene RO8O1, orthologous to the Drosophila roundabout gene, is disrupted by a chromosome translocation in a dyslexic individual. In a large pedigree with 21 dyslexic individuals genetically linked to a specific haplotype of ROBO1 (not found in any other chromosomes in our samples), the expression of ROBO1 from this haplotype was absent or attenuated in affected individuals. Sequencing of ROBO1 in apes revealed multiple coding differences, and the selection pressure was significantly different between the human, chimpanzee, and gorilla branch as compared to orangutan. We also identified novel exons and splice variants of ROBO1 that may explain the apparent phenotypic differences between human and mouse in heterozygous loss of ROBO1. We conclude that dyslexia may be caused by partial haplo-insufficiency for ROBO I in rare families. Thus, our data suggest that a slight disturbance in neuronal axon crossing across the midline between brain hemispheres, dendrite guidance, or another function of ROBO1 may manifest as a specific reading disability in humans."
Discovery of human inversion polymorphisms by comparative analysis of human and chimpanzee DNA sequence assemblies,"['Feuk, L', 'MacDonald, JR', 'Tang, T', 'Carson, AR', 'Li, M', 'Rao, G', 'Khaja, R', 'Scherer, SW']",PLOS GENETICS,10.1371/journal.pgen.0010056,OCT 2005,85,"With a draft genome-sequence assembly for the chimpanzee available, it is now possible to perform genome-wide analyses to identify, at a submicroscopic level, structural rearrangements that have occurred between chimpanzees and humans. The goal of this study was to investigate chromosomal regions that are inverted between the chimpanzee and human genomes. Using the net alignments for the builds of the human and chimpanzee genome assemblies, we identified a total of 1,576 putative regions of inverted orientation, covering more than 154 mega-bases of DNA. The DNA segments are distributed throughout the genome and range from 23 base pairs to 62 mega-bases in length. For the 66 inversions more than 25 kilobases (kb) in length, 75% were flanked on one or both sides by (often unrelated) segmental duplications. Using PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization we experimentally validated 23 of 27 (85%) semi-randomly chosen regions; the largest novel inversion confirmed was 4.3 mega-bases at human Chromosome 7p14. Gorilla was used as an out-group to assign ancestral status to the variants. All experimentally validated inversion regions were then assayed against a panel of human samples and three of the 23 (13%) regions were found to be polymorphic in the human genome. These polymorphic inversions include 730 kb (at 7p22), 13 kb (at 7q11), and 1 kb (at 16q24) fragments with a 5%, 30%, and 48% minor allele frequency, respectively. Our results suggest that inversions are an important source of variation in primate genome evolution. The finding of at least three novel inversion polymorphisms in humans indicates this type of structural variation may be a more common feature of our genome than previously realized."

We have identified human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-F orthologous DNA sequences in Pongidae in order to study the MHC-F gene evolution and its products' function. HLA-F orthologous cDNA transcripts are found in chimpanzee and in the new primate species studied (bonobo, gorilla and orangutan). Analyses of the predicted amino acid sequences and their comparison with other primate MHC-F proteins show that MHC-F may be a protein with a typical class I structure and that the key residues of the peptide-binding region (PBR) are highly conserved in MHC-F in all studied primates species. Thus, MHC-F conservation along the primate evolution suggests an important role in cellular physiology. It is possible that the MHC-F protein could be involved, together with MHC-G and MHC-E, in the natural killer (NK) cell activity regulation, although rhesus macaque does not express MHC-G and MHC-E orthologues. The evolutionary pathway of the six-base-pair deletion at exon 2 existing in some primates is put forward."
Identification of DNA of human origin based on amplification of human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome b region,"['Matsuda, H', 'Seo, Y', 'Kakizaki, E', 'Kozawa, S', 'Muraoka, E', 'Yukawa, N']",FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL,10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.07.019,SEP 10 2005,12,"Species-specific differences in a non-polymorphic region of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene appear to be large enough to allow human-specific amplification of forensic DNA samples. We therefore developed a PCR-based method using newly designed primers to amplify a 157-bp portion of the human mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The forward and reverse primers were designed to hybridize to regions of the human mitochondrial cytochrome b gene with sequences differing from those of chimpanzee by 26% (7 bp/27 bp) and 26% (6 bp/23 bp), respectively. Using this primer pair, we successfully amplified DNA extracted from blood samples of 48 healthy adults. All these human samples produced a single band of the expected size on agarose gel electrophoresis, and the sequence of the single band was shown to be identical to that of the target region (157 bp) by sequence analysis. On the other hand, no visible bands were amplified from DNA extracted from blood samples of animals including non-human primates (chimpanzee, gorilla, Japanese monkey, crab-eating monkey) and other species (cow, pig, dog, goat, rat, chicken and tuna). Thus, DNA producing a single band following PCR amplification using this primer pair can be reasonably interpreted as being of human origin. In addition, aged biological specimens comprising bloodstains, hair shafts and bones were successfully identified as being of human origin, illustrating the applicability of the present method to forensic specimens.

A note on the influence of visitors on the behaviour and welfare of zoo-housed gorillas,"['Wells, DL']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2005.06.019,SEP 2005,40,"Visitors to zoos can be a source of potential stress to some captive-housed primates. To date, the effect of the human audience on the welfare of captive gorillas has been overlooked. This study thus examined the behaviour of six zoo-housed gorillas during periods of both high and low visitor density, to establish whether there was any effect of audience numbers on the animals' well-being. Low visitor density encouraged behaviour suggestive of relaxation, with gorillas spending a significantly greater proportion of time resting. High visitor density, by contrast, encouraged significantly more intragroup aggression, stereotypies and autogrooming. The findings suggest that gorillas, like. many other species of primate, are excited by high numbers of visitors. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

It proposes a tentative framework for understanding partnerships in terms of their value for 'customers' and the potential that such partnerships have to create opportunities that would not exist in a silo driven service delivery model.

Glucocerebrosidase recombinant allele: Molecular evolution of the glucocerebrosidase gene and pseudogene in primates,"['Wafaei, JR', 'Choy, FYM', 'GAUCHER-DISEASE']",BLOOD CELLS MOLECULES AND DISEASES,10.1016/j.bmcd.2005.07.004,SEP-OCT 2005,3,"Glucocerebrosidase is a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyses the beta-glycosidic linkage of glucocerebroside, a ubiquitous sphingolipid present in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. Deleterious mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene result in Gaucher disease, the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease. Humans have one glucocerebrosidase functional gene and pseudogene that were located 16 kb apart on chromosome 1q21 and share 96% overall sequence similarity. Recombination between the two genes creates a 'complex allele' that renders glucocerebrosidase non-functional and accounts for >20% of the total Gaucher disease mutations in some population. The glucocerebrosidase pseudogene is absent in all other mammalian species surveyed so far. In order to learn more about the molecular evolution of the glucocerebrosidase functional gene and pseudogene, we have sequenced approximately 1.1 kb of the C-terminal region of these genes that encodes the enzyme catalytic site, from PCR-amplified genomic DNA of gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutan (the great apes), and squirrel monkey (a new-world monkey). In gorilla, chimpanzee, and orangutan, there are two copies of the glucocerebrosidase gene while the squirrel monkey possesses only a single copy. Similar to human, the second copy of glucocerebrosidase gene in gorilla and chimpanzee is nonfunctional because of a 55-bp deletion in exon 9, while that in orangutan appears to be unaffected and may still be functional. These data suggest that the glucocerebrosidase gene duplication event occurred after squirrel monkey divergence from the great apes, and that the exon 9 deletion that rendered the second copy of the glucocerebrosidase gene non-functional occurred prior to the divergence of gorilla and chimpanzee but after the divergence of orangutan from their common ancestor to human. The two genes in each species are least similar in gorilla and chimpanzee (97.8%) and most similar in orangutan (99.5%). None of the nucleotide variations in the GBA gene among the primates correspond to known mutations in Gaucher disease. Phylogenetic tree analysis using DNAstar and PAUP4.0 software indicates that gene conversion caused the evolution of glucocerebrosidase functional gene and pseudogene to be concerted.

Evolutionary mechanisms shaping the genomic structure of the Williams-Beuren syndrome chromosomal region at human 7q11.23,"['Antonell, A', 'de Luis, O', 'Domingo-Roura, X', 'Perez-Jurado, LA']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.3944605,SEP 2005,39,"About 5% of the human genome consists of segmental duplications or low-copy repeats, which are large, highly homologous (> 95%) fragments of sequence. It has been estimated that these segmental duplications emerged during the past similar to 35 million years (Myr) of human evolution and that they correlate with chromosomal rearrangements. Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a segmental aneusomy syndrome that is the result of a frequent de novo deletion at 7qll.23, mediated by large (similar to 400-kb) region-specific complex segmental duplications composed of different blocks. We have precisely defined the structure of the segmental duplications on human 7qll.23 and characterized the copy number and structure of the orthologous regions in other primates (macaque, orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee). Our data indicate a recent origin and rapid evolution of the 7qll.23 segmental duplications, starting before the diversification of hominoids (similar to 12-16 million years ago [Mya]), with species-specific duplications and intrachromosomal rearrangements that lead to significant differences among those genomes. Alu sequences are located at most edges of the large hominoid-specific segmental duplications, suggesting that they might have facilitated evolutionary rearrangements. We propose a mechanistic model based on Alu-mediated duplicated transposition along with nonallelic homologous recombination for the generation and local expansion of the segmental duplications. The extraordinary rate of evolutionary turnover of this region, rich in segmental duplications, results in important genomic variation among hominoid species, which Could be of functional relevance and predispose to disease."
Independent intrachromosomal recombination events underlie the pericentric inversions of chimpanzee and gorilla chromosomes homologous to human chromosome 16,"['Goidts, V', 'Szamalek, JM', 'de Jong, PJ', 'Cooper, DN', 'Chuzhanova, N', 'Hameister, H', 'Kehrer-Sawatzki, H']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.3732505,SEP 2005,27,"Analyses of chromosomal rearrangements that have occurred during the evolution of the hominoids can reveal much about the mutational mechanisms underlying primate chromosome evolution. We characterized the breakpoints of the pericentric inversion of chimpanzee chromosome 18 (PTR XVI), which is homologous to human chromosome 16 (HSA 16). A conserved 23 similar to kb inverted repeat composed of satellites, LINE and Alu elements was identified near the breakpoints and could have mediated the inversion by bringing the chromosomal arms into close proximity with each other, thereby facilitating intrachromosomal recombination. The exact positions of the breakpoints may then have been determined by local DNA sequence homologies between the inversion breakpoints, including a 22-base pair direct repeat. The similarly located pericentric inversion of gorilla (GGO) chromosome XVI, was studied by FISH and PCR analysis. The p- and q-arm breakpoints of the inversions in PTR XVI and GGO XVI were found to occur at slightly different locations, consistent with their independent origin. Further, FISH studies of the homologous chromosomal regions in macaque and orangutan revealed that the region represented by HSA BAC RP11-696PI9, which spans the inversion breakpoint on HSA 16qll-12, was derived from the ancestral primate chromosome homologous to HSA 1. After the divergence of orangutan from the other great apes -12 million years ago (Mya), a duplication of the corresponding region occurred followed by its interchromosomal transposition to the ancestral chromosome l6q. Thus, the most parsimonious interpretation is that the gorilla and chimpanzee homologs exhibit similar but nonidentical derived pericentric inversions, whereas HSA 16 represents the ancestral form among hominoids."

Optimal storage conditions for highly dilute DNA samples: A role for trehalose as a preserving agent,"['Smith, S', 'Morin, PA']",JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES,NA,SEP 2005,24,"DNA extraction from trace samples or noninvasively collected samples often results in the recovery of low concentration solutions of DNA that are prone to DNA degradation or other loss. Because of the difficulty in obtaining such samples, and their potentially high value in wildlife and forensic studies, it is critical that optimal methods are employed for their long-term storage. We assessed the amplification yield of samples kept under different storage conditions with the addition of potential preserving agents. We stored dilutions of known concentration human placental DNA, and gorilla fecal DNA, under four conditions (+4 degrees C, -20 degrees C, -80 degrees C, dry at room temperature), and with three additives (Tris EDTA (TE) buffer, Hind III digested Lambda DNA, trehalose). The effectiveness of the treatment methods was tested at regular intervals using qPCR to assess the quantity of amplifiable DNA, and a PCR assay of a larger 757 by fragment to evaluate the quality of that remaining DNA. The highest quantity of DNA remained in samples stored at -80 degrees C, regardless of storage additives, and those dried at room temperature in the presence of trehalose. Surprisingly, DNA was best preserved in the presence of trehalose, either dried or at -80 degrees C; significant quality loss occurred with -20 degrees C and +4 degrees C storage."
Ophthalmic examination of the captive western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Liang, D', 'Alvarado, TP', 'Oral, D', 'Vargas, JM', 'Denena, MM', 'McCulley, JP']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/03-121.1,SEP 2005,8,"This study examined the captive western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) eye as compared and contrasted with the human eye. Bilateral ophthalmic examinations of western lowland gorillas (n = 5) while under general anesthesia were performed opportunistically, including slit-lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundus examination, cycloplegic retinoscopy, Schiotz tonometry, corneal diameter and thickness measurements, A-scan and B-scan ultrasonography, keratometry, and cultures of the eyelid margins and bulbar conjunctiva. Mean spherical equivalent refractive error by cycloplegic retinoscopy was +1.20 +/- 0.59 diopters. Mean intraocular pressure by Schiotz tonometry was 12.0 +/- 4.3 mm Hg. Mean optic nerve head cup to disc ratio was 0.42 +/- 0.11. Mean horizontal corneal diameter was 13.4 +/- 0.8 mm, and mean vertical cornea diameter was 12.7 +/- 0.8 mm. Mean central corneal thickness by ultrasound pachymetry was 489 +/- 52 mu m. Mean axial length of the eye by A-scan was 22.75 +/- 0.71 mm. Mean lens thickness by A-scan was 4.23 +/- 0.34 mm. Mean anterior chamber depth by A-scan was 4.00 +/- 0.26 mm. Mean keratometry reading was 44.38 +/- 1.64 diopters. Eyelid margin and bulbar conjunctival cultures isolated Candida sp. (n = 5), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 3), Staphylococcus saccharolyticus (n = 3), and Micrococcus sp. (n = 3). This study suggests important similarities between western lowland gorilla and human eyes. These similarities may allow diagnostics, techniques, and equipment for human eye surgery, such as those used for cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation, to be successfully utilized for gorillas."

We examined human chromosome 21 and chimpanzee chromosome 22 to identify human specific elements or mutation events. PCR amplification was performed using genomic DNA samples from primates (1 human, 1 chimpanzee, 1 gorilla, 1 orangutan, 8 gibbons, 3 Old World monkeys, and 2 New World monkeys), indicating that the KAP13 gene family located on human chromosome 21q22.1 was deleted in the orthologous; locus of the chimpanzee and the gorilla. Comparative bioinformatics analysis of the flanking sequences in the deleted region between human and chimpanzee genomes suggests that the KAP13.4 gene is deleted independently through the Line1 mediated mechanism. Sequencing data of the KAP13.4 gene in various primates indicates that deletion and nonsynonymous substitution events have occurred independently during primate evolution."

Human thighs and susceptible apes: Self-implicating category confusion in Victorian discourse on West Africa,"['Bivona, D']",NINETEENTH CENTURY PROSE,NA,FAL 2005,2,"Adapting the insights of Mary Douglas, this article examines moments of self-implicating category confusion engendered by the anomalous but linked figures of the gorilla and the cannibal, which appear in a number of important Victorian exploration narratives about West Africa. The writers under examination include Du Chaillu, Stanley, Reade, Burton, and Kingsley. The article explores how certain moments in these explorers' narratives are ultimately self-implicating, revealing an implicit, if unacknowledged, anxiety about the explorer's dual place: both within a taxonomic schema and also outside and above it, holding the schema itself in conscious awareness. The article traces a change over time, from the urgently sensationalistic representations of apes and cannibals in Paul Du Chaillu's travelogue the 1850s, reflecting his anxious desire to establish credentials as taxonomist, explorer, ethnographer, and big-game hunter in a part of the world which Europe had not yet decided to incorporate into its empires, to the self-confident zoological and ethnographic project of Mary Kingsley in the 1890s, which brought her much acclaim for her critique of European ethnocentrism, a critique to some extent enabled by the assumption of European mastery of Africa in the wake of the Congress of Berlin. By breaking the mirror relationship of primate gazing on primate, cannibal on cannibal, that was the sensationalistic underpinning of the narratives of earlier male explorers, Kingsley places herself outside of the masculinist adventure tradition embodied by Stanley in order to secure her place within the more sophisticated game of worldwide empire - as an ideologist of its emerging governing philosophy of indirect rule."
Non-invasive fecal hormone analysis and behavioral observations for monitoring stress responses in captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Peel, AJ', 'Vogelnest, L', 'Finnigan, M', 'Grossfeldt, L', ""O'Brien, JK""]",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/ZOO.20055,SEP-OCT 2005,13,"Non-invasive techniques for monitoring the stress response in captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) were investigated. Fecal samples for cortisol measurement and concurrent behavioral data were collected from six individuals in a socially housed gorilla group (one adult male, three adult females and their three offspring) over a 7-month period. Despite inter-individual variation in the dynamics of fecal cortisol concentrations over time, several major secretory peaks coincided across individuals. High cortisol concentrations in feces were correlated with induced stressors or behavioral observations indicating high social tension, with a 1-2 day lag period. Entry progression order of the gorillas into a den complex and a supplant-based dominance index were suitable indicators of overall dominance hierarchies, and fluctuations over time reflected periods of instability. Diurnal variation in fecal cortisol was not apparent when comparing afternoon and morning samples, however the sample collection interval was relatively short (3-5 hr). These results demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring stress responses based on the dynamics of both fecal cortisol excretion and behavior. This non-invasive approach may be used for gauging responses to"
Wild chimpanzees show population-level handedness for tool use,"['Lonsdorf, EV', 'Hopkins, WD']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0505806102,AUG 30 2005,106,"Whether nonhuman primates exhibit population-level handedness remains a topic of considerable theoretical and empirical debate. One continued subject of discussion is whether evidence of population-level handedness in primates is confined to studies in captive animals or whether it is in both captive and wild subjects. Here, we report evidence of population-level handedness in wild chimpanzees for a tool-use task known as ""termite-fishing."" We subsequently compared the handedness for termite-fishing with other published reports on handedness for nut-cracking and wadge-dipping and found task-specific differences in handedness. Last, when combing all of the published data on tool use in wild chimpanzees, we show that hand preferences are heritable. Contrary to previous claims, our results demonstrate that population-level handedness is evident in wild chimpanzees and suggest that the antecedents of lateralization of function associated with hand use were present at least 5 million years ago, before the Pan-Homo split."

Our objectives were to develop methodologies for liquid storage of semen prior to sorting, sorting of liquid-stored and frozen-thawed spermatozoa, and assessment of sorting accuracy. In study 1, the in vitro sperm characteristics of gorilla ejaculates from one male were unchanged (P > 0.05) after 8 hr of liquid storage at 15 degrees C in a non-egg yolk diluent (HEPES-buffered modified Tyrode's medium). In study 2, we examined the efficacy of sorting fresh and frozen-thawed spermatozoa using human spermatozoa as a model for gorilla spermatozoa. Ejaculates from one male were split into fresh and frozen aliquots. X-enriched samples derived from both fresh and frozen-thawed human semen were of high purity, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; 90.7%+/- 2.3%, overall), and contained a high proportion of morphologically normal spermatozoa (86.0%+/- 1.0%, overall). In study 3, we processed liquid-stored semen from two gorillas for sorting using a modification of methods for human spermatozoa. The sort rate. for enrichment of X-bearing spermatozoa was 7.3+2.5 spermatozoa per second. The X-enriched samples were of high purity (single-sperm PCR: 83.7%) and normal morphology (79.0%+/- 3.9%). In study 4 we examined frozen-thawed gorilla semen, and the sort rate (8.3 +/- 2.9 X-bearing sperm/sec), purity (89.7%), and normal morphology (81.4%+/- 3.4%) were comparable to those of liquid-stored semen. Depending on the male and the type of sample used (fresh or frozen-thawed), 0.8-2.2% of gorilla spermatozoa in the processed ejaculate were present in the X-enriched sample. These results demonstrate that fresh or frozen-thawed gorilla spermatozoa can be flow cytometrically sorted into samples enriched for X-bearing spermatozoa."
Salivary cortisol and behaviour in an all-male group of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla),"['Kuhar, CW', 'Bettinger, TL', 'Laudenslager, ML']",ANIMAL WELFARE,NA,AUG 2005,14,"While the use of salivary cortisol as an index of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation has increased rapidly in human studies, few non-human primate studies have used saliva samples. Nearly 300 h of behavioural data and over 400 saliva samples were collected from three young adult, mate western lowland gorillas to document the feasibility and effectiveness of using salivary cortisol as an index of HPA activation in gorillas. Cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in morning samples than in afternoon samples, and there was a significant decrease in morning cortisol concentrations across the study period. Additionally, acute increases, followed by a return to baseline concentrations of cortisol were observed. Salivary cortisol concentration was found to correlate across individuals, indicating potential psychological attunement to environmental and/or social variables in these animals. Although no clear relationship between behaviour and cortisol concentrations was established, these results indicate that salivary cortisol is an effective technique for documenting HPA activity over an extended period of time, as it allows for detection of diurnal variation as well as acute changes in salivary cortisol concentrations."
Genetic diversity among African great apes based on mitochondrial DNA sequences,"['Guillen, AKZ', 'Barrett, GM', 'Takenaka, O']",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,10.1007/s10531-004-4781-y,AUG 2005,8,"The mitochondrial DNA D-Loop region was sequenced, analyzed and used as a molecular marker for populations of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), bonobo (P. paniscus) and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla and G. beringei), and also compared with data previously reported for these taxa. In Gorilla, a main disjunction between western (G. gorilla) and eastern (G. beringei, including G. b. graueri) species was observed, as well as high mitochondrial diversity within the western species. The genetic distance values within G. gorilla (0.14) were higher than those between subspecies (eastern lowland and mountain 0.12). Likewise, values of genetic diversity within this species (0.05) were higher than those between species (western and eastern lowland gorilla 0.04). Similarly, in genus Pan a main differentiation between western (P. t. verus) and central forms (P. t. troglodytes and P. t. schweinfurthii) was observed. The obtained values of genetic distance and genetic diversity revealed that the central subspecies are closer to each other than either of them is to the western one, while bonobos composed a distinct clade that expresses a well-defined specific identity. The current distribution, phylogeny and levels of genetic diversity in African great ape populations are consistent with the hypothesis that Pleistocene climatic events led to cyclical periods of isolation in forest refugia followed by expansion and dispersal. The implications of this high level of genetic diversity for taxonomic classification, wildlife management and conservation are discussed."
Evaluating the steady state assumption: Simulations of gorilla nest decay,"['Walsh, PD', 'White, LJT']",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,10.1890/03-5283,AUG 2005,20,"Large mammal surveys are often based on indices of animal abundance such as dung or, for great apes, sleeping nests. They also tend to rely on the ""steady state"" assumption that the rate at which an index is deposited in the environment is exactly balanced by the rate at which it disappears (decays). Here we use a data set on western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) sleeping nest decay rates to show that this assumption is likely to be strongly violated often and in ways that have serious implications for our ability to accurately survey and monitor a wide range of endangered species, particularly in tropical forests. We first fit the data using a model describing the daily probability of nest decay as a function of nest age. and monthly rainfall. We then use this decay model to simulate time series of gorilla nest standing stock, given observed rainfall regimes from a series of sites in the equatorial African country of Gabon. These simulations suggest that, within a given site, the relationship between nest standing stock and true gorilla density fluctuates wildly and is, on average, tens of percent away from the mean nest decay time for the empirical data set. The behavior of nest standing stock is extremely sensitive to variability in rainfall, not just annual mean rainfall. Differences between sites in rainfall variability produce counterintuitive differences between sites in nest standing stock. Multiyear trends in the mean and variance of rainfall produce the spurious impression of trends in animal abundance. Furthermore, heterogeneity in rainfall exists at all spatial and temporal scales, so that attempts to use regression models based on rainfall measurements taken at one location or time are not likely to accurately predict the nest decay regime at other places or times. We close with some suggestions on alternative estimation methods that do not rely on extrapolations of environmental conditions from one time or place to another."
Evidence for natural selection in the HAVCR1 gene: high degree of amino-acid variability in the mucin domain of human HAVCR1 protein,"['Nakajima, T', 'Wooding, S', 'Satta, Y', 'Jinnai, N', 'Goto, S', 'Hayasaka, I', 'Saitou, N', 'Guan-Jun, JG', 'Tokunaga, K', 'Jorde, LB', 'Emi, M', 'Inoue, I', 'AUTOIMMUNE']",GENES AND IMMUNITY,10.1038/sj.gene.6364215,AUG 2005,20,"The family of genes encoding T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing proteins ( Tim), which are cell-surface molecules expressed in CD4(+) T helper cells, has important roles in the immune system. Here, we report three unusual patterns of genetic variation in the human hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 gene ( HAVCR1) that are similar to patterns observed in major histocompatibility complex loci. First, levels of polymorphism in exon 4 of HAVCR1 were exceptionally high in humans ( nucleotide diversity ( p) 45.45 x 10(-4)). Second, nonsynonymous substitutions and insertion/deletion variants were more frequent than synonymous substitutions in that exon ( 10 out of 12 variants). The rate of the mean number of nucleotide substitutions at nonsynonymous sites to synonymous sites at HAVCR1-exon 4 > 1 ( P-A/ P-S = 1.92 and pi(A)/pi(S) = 2.23). Third, levels of divergence among human, chimp, and gorilla sequences were unusually high in HAVCR1-exon 4 sequences. These features suggest that patterns of variation in HAVCR1 have been shaped by both positive and balancing natural selection in the course of primate evolution. Evidence that the effects of natural selection are largely restricted to the mucin domain of HAVCR1 suggests that this region may be of particular evolutionary and epidemiological interest."

Experiment 3 evaluated their ability to select the larger of 2 pairs of quantities. All gorillas selected the larger pair more often than chance, and the old were less accurate and slower than were the young. For most gorillas, performance in relative numerousness judgment with training and summation was comparable with previous reports in chimpanzees and orangutans."

We analyzed the finished sequence of this human genomic region to investigate its evolutionary history. Phylogenetic analysis of > 1,500 alpha-satellite monomers from the region revealed the presence of five physical domains, each containing monomers from a distinct phylogenetic clade. The most distal domain contains long interspersed nucleotide element repeats that were active > 35 million years ago, whereas the four proximal domains contain more recently active long interspersed nucleotide element repeats. An out-of-register, unequal recombination (i.e., crossover) detected at the edge of the X chromosome-specific alpha-satellite array (DXZ1) may reflect the most recent of a series of punctuating events during evolution that resulted in a proximal physical expansion of the X centromere. The first 18 kb of this array has 97-99% pairwise identity among all 2-kb repeat units. To perform more detailed evolutionary comparisons, we sequenced the junction between the ancient DNA of Xp and the primate-specific alpha satellite in chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, vervet, macaque, and baboon. The striking conservation found in all cases supports the ancestral nature of the alpha satellite at this location. These studies demonstrate that the primate X centromere appears to have evolved through repeated expansion events occurring within the central, active region of centromeric DNA, with the newly added sequences then conferring centromere function."
Copy number polymorphism and expression level variation of the human alpha-defensin genes DEFA1 and DEFA3,"['Aldred, PMR', 'Hollox, EJ', 'Armour, JAL']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/ddi209,JUL 15 2005,105,"We have defined unexpectedly extensive copy number variation at the human anti-microbial alpha-defensin genes DEFA1 and DEFA3, encoding human neutrophil peptides HNP-1, HNP-2 and HNP-3. There was variation in both number and position of DEFA1/DEFA3 genes in arrays of 19 kb tandem repeats on 8p23.1, so that the DEFA1 and DEFA3 genes appear to be interchangeable variant cassettes within tandem gene arrays. For this reason, the official symbol for this locus has been revised to DEFA1A3. The total number of gene copies per diploid genome varied between four and 11 in a sample of 111 control individuals from the UK, with similar to 10% (11/111) of people lacking DEFA3 completely. DEFA1 appeared to be at high copy number in all great apes studied; at one variable site in the repeat unit, both variants have persisted in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas since their divergence. Analysis of expression levels in human white blood cells showed a clear correlation between the relative proportions of DEFA1:DEFA3 mRNA and corresponding gene numbers. However, there was no relationship between total (DEFA1+DEFA3) mRNA levels and total gene copy number, suggesting the superimposed influence of trans-acting factors. The persistence of DEFA1 at high copy number in other apes suggests an alternative model for the early stages of the evolution of novel genes by duplication and divergence. Duplicated genes present in variant tandem arrays may have greater potential than simple duplications for the combinatorial creation of new functions by recombination and gene conversion, while still preserving pre-existing functions on the same haplotype."
Brief communication: Is variation in the cranial capacity of the Dmanisi sample too high to be from a single species?,"['Lee, SH']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20105,JUL 2005,9,"This study uses data resampling to test the null hypothesis that the degree of variation in the cranial capacity of the Dmanisi hominid sample is within the range variation of a single species. The statistical significance of the variation in the Dmanisi sample is examined using simulated distributions based on comparative samples of modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Results show that it is unlikely to find the maximum difference observed in the Dmanisi sample in distributions of female-female pairs from comparative single-species samples. Given that two sexes are represented, the difference in the Dmanisi sample is not enough to reject the null hypothesis of a single species. Results of this study suggest no compelling reason to invoke multiple taxa to explain variation in the cranial capacity of the Dmanisi hominids. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Investigating the form-function interface in African apes: Relationships between principal moments of area and positional behaviors in femoral and humeral diaphyses,"['Carlson, KJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20124,JUL 2005,39,"Investigations of cross-sectional geometry in nonhuman primate limb bones typically attribute shape ratios to qualitative behavioral characterizations, e.g., leaper, slow climber, brachiator, or terrestrial vs. arboreal quadruped. Quantitative positional behavioral data, however, have yet to be used in a rigorous evaluation of such shape-behavior connections. African apes represent an ideal population for such an investigation because their relatedness minimizes phylogenetic inertia, they exhibit diverse behavioral repertoires, and their locomotor behaviors are known from multiple studies. Cross-sectional data from femoral and humeral diaphyses were collected for 222 wild-shot specimens, encompassing Pan paniscus and all commonly recognized African ape subspecies. Digital representations of diaphyseal cross sections were acquired via computed tomography at three locations per diaphysis. Locomotor behaviors were pooled broadly into arboreal and terrestrial categories, then partitioned into quadrupedal walking, quadrumanous climbing, scrambling, and suspensory categories. Sex-specific taxonomic differences in ratios of principal moments of area (PMA) were statistically significant more often in the femoral diaphysis than the humeral diaphysis. While it appears difficult to relate a measure of shape (e.g., PMA ratio) to individual locomotor modes, general locomotor differences (e.g., percentage arboreal vs. terrestrial locomotion) are discerned more easily. As percentage of arboreal locomotion for a group increases, average cross sections appear more circular. Associations between PMA ratio and specific locomotor behaviors are less straightforward. Individual behaviors that integrate eccentric limb positions (e.g., arboreal scrambling) may not engender more circular cross sections than behaviors that incorporate repetitive sagittal movements (e.g., quadrupedal walking) in a straightforward manner.

We studied the occurrence of various forms of arthritis to examine possible nature/nurture causality. The macerated skeletons of 38 G. beringei and 99 G. gorilla individuals were examined macroscopically for the presence of articular and osseous pathologies. Contrasting with only isolated osteoarthritis and infectious arthritis was the frequent occurrence of a form of erosive arthritis associated with joint fusion. Twenty-one percent of the G. beringei and 20% of G. gorilla specimens were afflicted, which are statistically indistinguishable frequencies. While both had prominent axial disease, they differed in patterns of peripheral arthritis. Whereas G. beringei showed a pauciarticular pattern, the pattern in G. gorilla was more often polyarticular. Susceptibility to spondyloarthropathy was apparently genetically imprinted before Gorilla separated into G. gorilla and G. beringei. However, the different patterns of peripheral joint involvement suggest a causality resulting from lifestyle (e.g., the presence/absence or extent of knuckle walking) or a habitat-related infectious agent."

This theory has been supported more predominantly by studies of frugivorous primate species than by studies of folivorous species. We examined the ranging patterns of mountain gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, who include both herbaceous vegetation and fruit in their diet, to determine how ecological, behavioral, and social parameters influence movement patterns. Data were collected from three groups of gorillas with overlapping home ranges at a low-altitude location (1,450-1,800 m) and one group at a high-altitude location (2,100-2,500 m) in Bwindi from September 2001 to August 2002. We analyzed daily travel distance and home range size in relation to group size, while also considering patterns of frugivory, rainfall, and location ( proxy for food availability) within the park. Both daily travel distance and home range size were positively related to group size. In addition, the degree of frugivory positively influenced daily travel distance and home range size, while rainfall negatively influenced daily travel distance only. Finally, groups at the low-altitude location, with higher fruit availability, traveled less than the group at the high-altitude location. These results demonstrate that mountain gorillas in Bwindi provide support for the ecological constraints model, but further studies are needed to determine how fine-scale spatial and temporal availability of food resources influence movement patterns. Ranging patterns of Bwindi gorillas are compared to those observed in other gorilla populations in the context of the ecological constraints."
Fitness consequences of dispersal decisions for male mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei),"['Robbins, AM', 'Robbins, MM']",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,10.1007/s00265-005-0917-7,JUL 2005,32,"The fitness consequences of dispersal decisions are difficult to quantify, especially for long-lived species with complex social systems. To calculate those consequences for male mountain gorillas, from the perspective of both subordinate and dominant males, we used behavioral and demographic data obtained over 30 years from the Virunga Volcano population to develop an agent-based model that simulates the life history events, social structure, and population dynamics of the species. The model included variables for birth rates, mortality rates, dispersal patterns, and reproductive skew. The model predicted an average lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of 3.2 for philopatric males ( followers) and 1.6 for emigrants. The benefits of philopatry were most sensitive to opportunities for social queuing and to female transfer preferences, but philopatry remained the best strategy over a wide range of group conditions and hypothetical simulations. The average LRS for dominant males was 4.5 when a subordinate stayed and 4.6 when the subordinate emigrated. The dispersal decision of the subordinate male had little impact on the fitness of the dominant male because it came relatively late in the dominant male's reproductive life span, and it changed his group composition only incrementally. The fitness consequences for the dominant male were most sensitive to the degree of reproductive skew. Since subordinates suffer a fitness loss when they leave a group, they should accept whatever reproductive restraint is needed to avoid eviction, and the dominant male does not need to offer concessions for them to stay. The dominant male may offer reproductive concessions for other reasons, such as peace incentives or to confuse paternity, or he may not have complete control of reproduction within his group."
"Female dispersal, inbreeding avoidance and mate choice in Thomas langurs (Presbytis thomasi)","['Sterck, EHM', 'Willems, EP', 'van Hooff, JARAM', 'Wich, SA']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/1568539055010093,JUL 2005,29,"Female social dispersal in primates differs from the general mammalian pattern of locational dispersal. Both nulliparous and parous females may disperse to another group. Several hypotheses can explain female social dispersal: reduction of predation risk, inbreeding avoidance, and offspring protection through mate choice. We tested these hypotheses with an extended data set of Thomas langurs (Presbytis thomasi) and investigated parameters of male behaviour that females may use in their dispersal decisions. Data were collected over a 12.5-year period from a wild population in Sumatra, Indonesia, allowing for some critical tests of the hypotheses. Females dispersed to a group smaller than their original one, thereby refuting the predation risk hypothesis. Maturing nulliparous females only dispersed when their father was resident. Therefore, dispersal by nulliparous females was best explained through inbreeding avoidance. Parous females transferred to young, adult males. These males provided better protection to offspring against predation and infanticide than the old, late tenure males. Therefore, females transfer to better protector males. The male behavioural cues that females use to assess male quality were unclear. Females, however, may use proxies of male age, such as group composition and acoustical characteristics of loud calls, as indicators of male quality. The results suggest that female mate choice is an important function of social dispersal by parous females. Its importance in locational dispersal remains to be investigated."
Group differences in the mutual gaze of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Bard, KA', 'Myowa-Yamakoshi, M', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Tanaka, M', 'Costall, A', 'Matsuzawa, T']",DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/0012-1649.41.4.616,JUL 2005,44,"A comparative developmental framework was used to determine whether mutual gaze is unique to humans and, if not, whether common mechanisms support the development of mutual gaze in chimpanzees and humans. Mother-infant chimpanzees engaged in approximately 17 instances of mutual gaze per hour. Mutual gaze occurred in positive, nonagonistic contexts. Mother-infant chimpanzees at a Japanese center exhibited significantly more mutual gaze than those at a center in the United States. Cradling and motor stimulation varied across groups. Time spent cradling infants was inversely related to mutual gaze. It is suggested that in primates, mutual engagement is supported via an interchangeability of tactile and visual modalities. The importance of mutual gaze is best understood within a perspective that embraces both cross-species and cross-cultural data."
Primates and the ecology of their infectious diseases: How will anthropogenic change affect host-parasite interactions?,"['Chapman, CA', 'Gillespie, TR', 'Goldberg, TL']",EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/evan.20068,JUL-AUG 2005,85,"The sudden appearance of diseases like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome(1)), the devastating impacts of diseases like Ebola on both human and wildlife communities,(2,3) and the immense social and economic costs created by viruses like HIV4 underscore our need to understand the ecology of infectious diseases. Given that monkeys and apes often share parasites with humans, understanding the ecology of infectious diseases in nonhuman primates is of paramount importance. This is well illustrated by the HIV viruses, the causative agents of human AIDS, which evolved recently from related viruses of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys(5)), as well as by the outbreaks of Ebola virus, which trace their origins to zoonotic transmissions from local apes.(6) A consideration of how environmental change may promote contact between humans and nonhuman primates and thus increase the possibility of sharing infectious diseases detrimental to humans or nonhuman primates is now paramount in conservation and human health planning."

Such studies are particularly informative within human pericentromeric regions-areas of particularly rapid change in genomic structure. Here, we present a systematic analysis of the evolutionary history of one similar to 700-kb region of 2pll, including the first autosomal transition from pericentromeric sequence to higher-order alpha-satellite DNA. We show that this region is composed of segmental duplications corresponding to 14 ancestral segments ranging in size from 4 kb to similar to 115 kb. These duplicons show 94%-98.5% sequence identity to their ancestral loci. Comparative FISH and phylogenetic analysis indicate that these duplicons are differentially distributed in human, chimpanzee, and gorilla genomes, whereas baboon has a single putative ancestral locus for all but one of the duplications. Our analysis supports a model where duplicative transposition events Occurred during a narrow window of evolution after the separation of the human/ape lineage from the Old World monkeys (10-20 million years ago). Although dramatic secondary dispersal events Occurred during the radiation of the human, chimpanzee, and gorilla lineages, duplicative transposition seeding events of new material to this particular pericentromeric region abruptly ceased after this time period. The multiplicity of initial duplicative transpositions prior to the separation of humans and great-apes Suggests a Punctuated model for the formation of highly duplicated pericentromeric regions within the human genome. The data further indicate that factors other than sequence are important determinants for Such bursts of duplicative transposition from the euchromatin to pericentromeric regions."

The possibility of sex identification was examined by typing the AMG gene using hair and fecal samples from captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Japan and hair samples from wild eastern lowland gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri) in the Kahuzi-Biega National Park, Democratic Republic of Congo, which were sexed by direct observation.

Mountain gorilla tug-of-war: Silverbacks have limited control over reproduction in multimale groups,"['Bradley, BJ', 'Robbins, MM', 'Williamson, EA', 'Steklis, HD', 'Steklis, NG', 'Eckhardt, N', 'Boesch, C', 'Vigilant, L']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0502019102,JUN 28 2005,80,"To determine who fathers the offspring in wild mountain gorilla groups containing more than one adult male silverback, we genotyped nearly one-fourth (n = 92) of the mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) living in the Virunga Volcanoes region of Africa. Paternity analysis of 48 offspring born into four groups between 1985 and 1999 revealed that, although all infants were sired by within-group males, the socially dominant silverback did not always monopolize reproduction within his group. Instead, the second-ranking male sired an average of 15 % of group offspring. This result, in combination with previous findings that second-ranking males fare best by not leaving the group but by staying and waiting to assume dominance even if no reproduction is possible while waiting, is not consistent with expectations from a reproductive skew model in which the silverback concedes controllable reproduction to the second-ranking male. Instead, the data suggest a ""tug-of-war"" scenario in which neither the dominant nor the second-ranking male has full control over his relative reproductive share. The two top-ranked males were typically unrelated and this, in combination with the mixed paternity of group offspring, means that multimale gorilla groups do not approximate family groups. Instead, as long-term assemblages of related and unrelated individuals, gorilla groups are similar to chimpanzee groups and so offer interesting possibilities for kin-biased interactions among individuals."

"Long-term dominance relationships in female mountain gorillas: strength, stability and determinants of rank","['Robbins, MM', 'Robbins, AM', 'Gerald-Steklis, N', 'Steklis, HD']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/1568539054729123,JUN 2005,32,"A common practice in studies of social animals is to rank individuals according to dominance status, which has been shown to influence access to limited resources and stability of social relationships, and may in turn correlate with reproductive success. According to the socioecological model for primates, most female dominance relationships are either nepotistic or virtually undetectable (egalitarian), with nepotistic species being philopatric, and dispersing females being egalitarian. Female mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) disperse, and they have been characterized as being egalitarian, but previous studies have not examined their dominance relationships from a long-term perspective. We evaluated 15 matrices of displacement/supplantation interactions that spanned 30 years of observations in the Virunga Volcanoes region, and included 51 female mountain gorillas in six groups. Only 4% of displacements were directed against higher ranking females, and when matrices had less than 5% unknown dyads, linearity indices were consistently greater than 0.95. Therefore, previous results suggesting undetectable dominance relationships may have reflected an insufficient quantity of data for this species, rather than actual nonlinearity in its hierarchies. Dominance depended on age and group tenure rather than nepotism, yet some females maintained a high ranking for most of adulthood (15-25 years). Most rank shifts occurred through changes in group composition, rather than switches in established relationships. These results fit within growing evidence for linear individualistic hierarchies in some primates, often coupled with dispersal, as commonly found in ungulates. In light of these results, we propose that the dominance relationships of female mountain gorilla are best characterized as ' Dispersal-Individualistic ' instead of the previously suggested ' Dispersal-Egalitarian '."

Price premiums in the mist,"['Anderson, RC', 'Laband, DN', 'Hansen, EN', 'Knowles, CD']",FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL,NA,JUN 2005,13,"Consumers shopping at the Oregon State University (OSU) and Auburn University (AU) bookstores were offered a choice between ecolabeled and non-ecolabeled wood pencils. Aside from the presence or absence of an ecolabel, the pencils were identical in all other respects. Sales of each pencil type were tracked during a number of pricing conditions: prices equal for each pencil type, a 20 percent premium on ecolabeled pencils, and a 100 percent ecolabeled premium (at OSU only). Many forest certification proponents claim that ecolabels are associated with increased sales, price premiums, or both. To begin clearing the ""mist"" shrouding such claims, comparisons were made between the quantity sold of each pencil type under each pricing condition. Our results show that OSU and AU pencil consumers were largely indifferent to the presence of an ecolabel. However, as the price premium ""gorilla"" gets bigger, more and more consumers abandoned their indifference and purchased the cheaper non-ecolabeled pencils."
Evolutionary conservation of 5 ' upstream sequence of nine genes between human and great apes,"['Kitano, T', 'Saitou, N']",GENES & GENETIC SYSTEMS,10.1266/ggs.80.225,JUN 2005,3,"Nucleotide sequences of nine 5' upstream gene regions for human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan were determined. We estimated nucleotide differences (d) for each region between human and great apes. The overall d was 0.027 (ranged from 0.004 to 0.052). Rates of nucleotide substitution were estimated by using d and divergence times of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. The overall rate of nucleotide substitution between human and other hominoids was estimated to be 0.52-0.85 x 10(-9). This rate in 5' upstream regions was lower than that of synonymous sites, suggesting that 5' upstream regions have evolved under some functional constraints. Because lower rates have been reported for coding sequences in primates compared to rodents, we also estimated the rate (1.17-1.76 x 10-9) of nucleotide substitutions for the corresponding 5' upstream regions in rodents (mouse/rat comparison). Thus the primate rate was lower than rodent rate also for the 5' upstream regions."
"Relationship between urinary estrogen levels before conception and sex ratio at birth in a primate, the gray mouse lemur","['Perret, M', 'MESOCRICETUS-AURATUS']",HUMAN REPRODUCTION,10.1093/humrep/deh802,JUN 2005,21,"BACKGROUND: In primates, including humans, bias of sex ratio at birth has been reported to depend on maternal condition at conception. In a Malagasy primate, the gray mouse lemur, male-biased sex ratio at birth occurred in captive parous females. The male bias was previously demonstrated to be pre-conceptual and independent of the female's nutritional state. It was hypothesized to be related to changes in hormonal state at ovulation. METHODS and RESULTS: The relationship between urinary estradiol (E-2) levels during the follicular phase until estrus and litter production (number and sex of newborns) was assessed in 91 females mated under controlled conditions. Changes in E-2 levels prior to ovulation followed the typical primate pattern characterized by a gradual rise during the 10 days preceding the sharp increase at estrus. A clear decline in E-2 levels occurred with ageing. Direction of the sex ratio bias was unrelated to E-2 levels at ovulation time but was significantly dependent on E-2 levels during the follicular phase. Reduced E-2 levels prior to estrus led to male-biased litters. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that hormonal stimulation during the follicular phase plays a role in shifting sex ratio at conception through changes in the local environment of the ova. This hypothesis deserves testing by assessing estrogen levels throughout the follicular phase in other primate species including humans."
Significance of riparian forests for the conservation of Central African primates,"['Gautier-Hion, A', 'Brugiere, D']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-005-4363-1,JUN 2005,2,"We compared the structure of 12 Central African primate communities, 6 in riparian forests and 6 in adjacent terra firma forests and discussed the implications for primate conservation. The communities in riparian forests included on average 1.5 times more primate species than those in terra firma forests due to the fact that riparian forests shelter 4 specialist species and 6-7 generalist species. The results differ from findings in Amazonia where riparian forests consistently have fewer primate species than terra firma forests accommodate. This may be partly explained by the water level amplitude in Amazonian riparian forests, which deterred the radiation of semiterrestrial species. In Africa, most riparian-specialist primates are terrestrially-adapted and have access to an enlarged food niche. In terms of African primate conservation, we recommend protecting riparian forests and adjacent terra firma forests so that most of the lowland forest diversity is captured. The linear shape of riparian forests (which allows gene flow over long distance) and their persistence in anthropic landscape (because they represent lands of lesser value for agriculture and logging than mainland forests) predispose them to act as biodiversity sanctuaries."
Seed-spitting primates and the conservation and dispersion of large-seeded trees,"['Dominy, NJ', 'Duncan, BW']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-005-4370-2,JUN 2005,18,"Primate frugivory may reduce density-dependent predation on seeds and seedlings via effective seed dispersal. Accordingly, the tendency of cercopithecines to spit and scatter seeds > 4 mm wide could represent a prominent means of dispersal. However, the importance of seed-spitting may vary according to the life history adaptations of plants. Indeed, the actions of cercopithecines may be incongruent with the reproductive biology of plants that rely on large frugivores to swallow and defecate their seeds. This possibility raises conservation concerns because large frugivores are often susceptible to extirpation or extinction from hunting and habitat fragmentation. It is therefore important to determine if cercopithecines have a compensatory effect; that is, whether or not seed-spitting effectively conveys large seeds to recruitment sites. To test this concept, we used geospatial techniques to measure and analyze the dispersion of tree species dispersed by elephants, chimpanzees, and cercopithecines to different spatial extents. We studied adult trees of Balanites wilsoniana, Chrysophyllum gorungosanum, and Uvariopsis congensis in a 2.2-ha plot in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Despite the tendency of cercopithecines to spit the seeds of Uvariopsis congensis, adult trees were highly clumped, with a modal nearest-neighbor distance of < 5 m and a crown overlap of 1.5 m. Virtually identical results for Balanites wilsoniana and Chrysophyllum gorungosanum, the seeds of which are not spat, suggest that seed-spitting may be a poor mechanism of dispersal for some large-seeded plants."
A comparative analysis of temporomandibular joint morphology in the African apes,"['Taylor, AB']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.01.003,JUN 2005,14,"A number of researchers have suggested a functional relationship between dietary variation and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) morphology, yet few studies have evaluated TMJ form in the African apes. In this study, I compare TMJ morphology in adults and during ontogeny in Gorilla (G.g. beringei, G.g. graueri, and G.g. gorilla) and Pan (P. paniscus, P. troglodytes troglodytes, P.t. schweinfurthii, and P.t. verus). I test two hypotheses: first, compared to all other African apes, G.g. beringei exhibits TMJ morphologies that would be predicted for a primate that consumes a diet comprised primarily of moderately to very tough, leafy vegetation; and second, all gorillas exhibit the same predicted morphologies compared to Pan. Compared to all adult African apes, G.g. beringei has higher rami and condyles positioned further above the occlusal plane of the mandible, relative to jaw length. Thus, mountain gorillas have the potential to generate relatively more muscle force, more evenly distribute occlusal forces along the postcanine teeth, and generate relatively greater jaw adductor moment. G.g. beringei also exhibits relatively wider mandibular condyles, suggesting these folivorous apes are able to resist relatively greater compressive loads along the lateral and/or medial aspect of the condyle. All gorillas likewise exhibit these same shape differences compared to Pan. These morphological responses are the predicted consequences of intensification of folivory and, as such, provide support for functional hypotheses linking these TMJ morphologies to degree of folivory. The African apes to not, however, demonstrate a systematic pattern of divergence in relative condylar area as a function of intensification of folivory. The ontogenetic trajectories for gorillas are significantly elevated above those of Pan, and to a lesser but still significant degree,, mountain gorillas similarly deviate from lowland gorillas (G.g. gorilla and G.g. graueri). Thus, adult shape differences in ramal and condylar heights do not result from the simple extrapolation of common growth allometries relative to jaw length. As such, they are suggestive of an adaptive shift towards a tougher, more folivorous diet. However, the allometric patterning for condylar area and condylar width does not systematically conform to predictions based on dietary specialization. Thus, while differences in condylar shapes may confer functional advantages both during growth and as adults, there is no evidence to suggest selection for altered condylar proportions, independent of the effects of changes in jaw size.

Variation in hominoid molar enamel thickness,"['Smith, TM', 'Olejniczak, AJ', 'Martin, LB', 'Reid, DJ']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.02.004,JUN 2005,50,"Enamel thickness has figured prominently in discussions of hominid origins for nearly a century, although little is known about its intra-taxon variation. It has been suggested that enamel thickness increases from first to third molars, perhaps due to varying functional demands or developmental constraints, but this has not been tested with appropriate statistical methods. We quantified enamel cap area (c), dentine area (b), and enamel-dentine junction length (c) in coronal planes of sections through the mesial and distal cusps in 57 permanent molars of Pan and 59 of Pongo, and calculated average (c/e) and relative enamel thickness (([c/e]/root b) * 100). Posteriorly increasing or decreasing trends in each variable and average (AET) and relative enamel thickness (RET) were tested among molars in the same row. Differences between maxillary and mandibular analogues and between mesial and distal sections of the same tooth were also examined. In mesial sections of both genera, enamel cap area significantly increased posteriorly, except in Pan maxillary sections. In distal sections of maxillary teeth, trends of decreasing dentine area were significant in both taxa, possibly due to hypocone reduction. Significant increases in AET and RET posteriorly were found in all comparisons, except for AET in Pongo distal maxillary sections. Several significant differences were found between maxillary and mandibular analogues in both taxa. Relative to their mesial counterparts, distal sections showed increased enamel cap area and/or decreased dentine area, and thus increased AET and RET. This study indicates that when AET and RET are calculated from samples of mixed molars, variability is exaggerated due to the lumping of tooth types. To maximize taxonomic discrimination using enamel thickness, tooth type and section plane should be taken into account. Nonetheless, previous findings that African apes have relatively thinner enamel than Pongo is supported for certain molar positions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

It is unclear if this difference is a direct result of poor health status for the great apes, or if it represents differential incidence due to a lower threshold (sensu Goodman and Rose, 1990 Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. [suppl.] 33:59-110) for the occurrence of enamel hypoplasia among great apes. This study uses the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's great ape collection to examine the prevalence of LEH, the most common type of hypoplasia observed. Frequencies of LEH are reported, as well as analyses by taxa and provenience. The study sample consists of 136 specimens and includes 41 gorillas, 25 chimpanzees, and 70 orangutans. Analyses of frequencies are presented for both individuals and teeth by taxonomic category and locality. Among the individuals in this study, 63.97% are affected by LEH. Overall, gorillas (29.27%) exhibit lower frequencies of LEH than chimpanzees (68.00%) and orangutans (82.86%). There is a marked difference in LEH frequencies between mountain and lowland gorillas. There is no difference in LEH frequencies between Sumatran and Bornean orangutans. A range of variation for the great apes in enamel hypoplasia frequencies is found when taxon and locality are considered. It is likely that both biological and environmental factors influence the high frequencies of enamel hypoplasia exhibited in the great apes. Am J Phys Anthropol 127:13-25, 2005.

Development of ecological competence in Sumatran orangutans,"['van Noordwijk, MA', 'van Schaik, CP']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10426,MAY 2005,44,"Data on orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus abelii) living in a Sumatran swamp forest yield an estimated median interbirth interval of at least 8 years, concurring with findings from other sites. This longest known mammalian interbirth interval appears due to maternal amenorrhea during the long exclusive dependence of the offspring. We describe the development of various components of offspring independence. In this arboreal ape, 3-year-olds had largely reached locomotor independence. Nest-building skills were also well-developed in 3-year-olds, but immatures shared their mother's nest until weaned at around age 7. At time of birth of the new sibling, association with the mother had begun to decline for both male and female offspring, suggesting that the immatures had mastered all the necessary skills, including basic tool use, to feed themselves. By about 11 years of age, they also ranged independently from the mother. These results show that orangutans do not develop independence more slowly than chimpanzees. Why, then, is weaning 2 years later in orangutans? In chimpanzees, mothers are often accompanied by two or even three consecutive offspring, unlike in orangutans. This contrast suggests that an orangutan mother cannot give birth until the previous offspring is ecologically competent enough to begin to range independently of her, probably due to the high energy costs of association. Thus, the exceptionally long interbirth intervals of orangutans may be a consequence of their solitary lifestyle. Am J Phys Anthropol 127:79-94, 2005. (c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Effects of various extenders and permeating cryoprotectants on cryopreservation of cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) spermatozoa,"['Li, YH', 'Cai, KJ', 'Kovacs, A', 'Ji, WZ']",JOURNAL OF ANDROLOGY,10.2164/jandrol.04147,MAY-JUN 2005,23,"The cryoprotective effects of 11 different extenders, TTE, DM, mDM, LG-DM, G-DM, TCG, TEST, TSM, Test-M, Test-H, and LM, on sperm cryopreservation of cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) have been compared with glycerol as cryoprotectant. Sperm motility, plasma membrane, and acrosomal integrity were examined to evaluate frozen-thawed sperm function. The results showed that TTE, DM, mDM, LG-DM, G-DM, and TCG exhibited the best and similar protective efficiencies for cynomolgus monkey sperm cryopreservation in terms of sperm motility and plasma membrane integrity (P &GT; .05). The acrosomal integrity for spermatozoa cryopreserved in TCG was statistically lower than that of TTE, DM, mDM, LG-DM, and G-DM (P &LT; .05) but was significantly higher than that of TEST, TSM, Test-M, Test-H, and LM (P &LT; .05). The postthaw sperm motility for 5 other extenders (TEST, TSM, Test-M, Test-H, and LIVI) did not exceed 30%, and the 3 sperm parameters evaluated for them were significantly lower than that of TTE, DM, mDM, LG-DM, G-DM, and TCG (P &LT; .05). On the basis of these findings, 5 commonly used permeating cryoprotectants, glycerol, ethylene glycol, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetamide and propylene glycol have further been tested for their effectiveness on sperm cryopreservation in extenders of TTE, DM, mDM, LG-DM, G-DM, and TCG. The results showed that the sperm cryoprotective efficiencies of glycerol and ethylene glycol were similar and best among 5 permeating cryoprotectant treatments (P &GT; .05). Dimethyl sulfoxide or acetamide resulted in average cryoprotection for cynomolgus monkey spermatozoa: poorer than glycerol or ethylene glycol but better than that of propylene glycol (P &LT; .05). In addition, the action of permeating cryoprotectant appeared to be independent of extenders. The results in the present study demonstrate that 1) TTE, DM, mDM, LG-DM, G-DM, and TCG are excellent extenders and suitable for cynomolgus monkey sperm cryopreservation; 2) the mechanism of action of permeating cryoprotectants are not affected by extender composition; 3) ethylene glycol has a similar cryoprotective efficacy to glycerol that makes it a successful cryoprotectant for sperm cryopreservation in cynomolgus monkeys."
All great ape species follow gaze to distant locations and around barriers,"['Brauer, J', 'Call, J', 'Tomasello, M']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/0735-7036.119.2.145,MAY 2005,103,"Following the gaze direction of conspecifics is an adaptive skill that enables individuals to obtain useful information about the location of food, predators, and group mates. In the current study, the authors compared the gaze-following skills of all 4 great ape species. In the 1st experiment, a human either looked to the ceiling or looked straight ahead. Individuals from all species reliably followed the human's gaze direction and sometimes even checked back when they found no target. In a 2nd experiment, the human looked behind some kind of barrier. Results showed that individuals from all species reliably put themselves in places from which they could see what the experimenter was looking at behind the barrier. These results support the hypothesis that great apes do not just orient to a target that another is oriented to, but they actually attempt to take the visual perspective of the other."
Episodic-like memory in a gorilla: A review and new findings,"['Schwartz, BL', 'Hoffman, ML', 'Evans, S']",LEARNING AND MOTIVATION,10.1016/j.lmot.2005.02.012,MAY 2005,29,"The current paper examines if gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) possess an episodic memory system. Episodic memory, in humans, is a neurocognitive system that stores information about the personal past. Unique to episodic memory is its palinscopic or past-focused orientation; most memory systems serve to provide the organism with up to date knowledge of the current state of the world. We review four operational definitions that have been used to address issues of episodic memory in non-humans and review the literature with a focus on the studies previously done on gorillas. We describe two new studies with King, an adult male western lowland gorilla. We show that King can remember the order of past events (Experiment 1) and that King can remember where events occurred (Experiment 2). We conclude by discussing alternate explanations of our findings and speculate on future directions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
A genomic region evolving toward different GC contents in humans and chimpanzees indicates a recent and regionally limited shift in the mutation pattern,"['Ebersberger, I', 'Meyer, M']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msi109,MAY 2005,9,"DNA sequences evolving differently in the human and chimpanzee genomes signal recent and regionally limited changes in the process of DNA sequence evolution. Here we present the comparison of 90 kb from the nonrecombining part of the human Y chromosome to the corresponding part of the chimpanzee genome using gorilla as out-group. Our results reveal a significant difference in the region-specific substitution process among the human and chimpanzee lineages. As a consequence, this region experiences a change in its GC content on the human lineage while it resides in compositional equilibrium on the chimpanzee lineage. Based on our analysis, we suggest a recent and species-specific shift in the region's mutation pattern as the cause of its differing evolution in humans and chimpanzees."

Of the studies, 73% were classified as non-invasive, whereas 27% were classified as invasive. Among the invasive studies, 39% were scored as of mild severity, and 61% were scored as of moderate/substantial severity. Pan species were involved in 65% of the studies, Gorilla species in 15%, Pongo species in 12%, and Hylobates species in 8%. Most of the invasive research was conducted in the USA (60%).

Australopithecus anamensis: A finite element approach to studying the functional adaptations of extinct hominins,"['Macho, GA', 'Shimizu, D', 'Jiang, Y', 'Spears, LR']",ANATOMICAL RECORD PART A-DISCOVERIES IN MOLECULAR CELLULAR AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.a.20175,APR 2005,51,"Australopithecus anamensis is the stem species of all later hominins and exhibits the suite of characters traditionally associated with hominins, i.e., bipedal locomotion when on the ground, canine reduction, and thick-enameled teeth. The functional consequences of its thick enamel are, however, unclear. Without appropriate structural reinforcement, these thick-enameled teeth may be prone to failure. This article investigates the mechanical behavior of A. anamensis enamel and represents the first in a series that will attempt to determine the functional adaptations of hominin teeth. First, the microstructural arrangement of enamel prisms in A. anamensis teeth was reconstructed using recently developed software and was compared with that of extant hominoids. Second, a finite-element model of a block of enamel containing one cycle of prism deviation was reconstructed for Homo, Pan, Gorilla, and A. anamensis and the behavior of these tissues under compressive stress was determined. Despite similarities in enamel microstructure between A. anamensis and the African great apes, the structural arrangement of prismatic enamel in A. anamensis appears to be more effective in load dissipation under these compressive loads. The findings may imply that this hominin species was well adapted to puncture crushing and are in some respects contrary to expectations based on macromorphology of teeth. Taking together, information obtained from both finite-element analyses and dental macroanatomy leads us to suggest that A. anamensis was probably adapted for habitually consuming a hard-tough diet. However, additional tests are needed to understand the functional adaptations of A. anamensis teeth fully. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Hominoid teeth with chimpanzee- and gorilla-like features from the Miocene of Kenya: implications for the chronology of ape-human divergence and biogeography of Miocene hominoids,"['Pickford, M', 'Senut, B']",ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE,10.1537/ase.04S014,APR 2005,21,"One of the major lacunae in our knowledge of African hominoid evolution concerns the origins of the chimpanzee and gorilla. Several thousand specimens from the Plio-Pleistocene of Africa have been attributed to Hominidae (sensu stricto) of which only a few, including Ardipithecus ramidus, have been re-interpreted by some authors as possibly representing an ape rather than a hominid (Senut, 1998). Four recently discovered ape-like specimens from the late Middle Miocene (12.5 Ma) and Late Miocene (5.9 Ma) of Kenya partly fill the gap in the fossil record of African apes, and show some morphological and metric affinities with teeth of chimpanzees and gorillas. If these few specimens from Kenya are indeed more closely related to chimps and gorillas than to hominids, then this implies that the dichotomy between African apes and hominids occurred several million years earlier than is currently estimated by most researchers. Furthermore these ape teeth from Ngorora and Lukeino suggest that extant African apes evolved in Africa, and did not immigrate into the continent from Europe or Asia."

The hominoid proximal radius: re-interpreting locomotor behaviors in early hominins,"['Patel, BA', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-ANAMENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.01.001,APR 2005,17,"Studies of fossil hominins are traditionally taxonomically narrow and often exclude comparisons with hylobatids. Hence, results of functional analyses of postcrania, interpreted as indicating that early hominins are ""African-ape-like"" in their postcranial skeletons and positional behaviors, may reflect an artifact of inadequate taxonomic and morphological breadth of the comparative sample. To address this problem and better understand early hominin positional behaviors, this study included hylobatids in a comparative analysis, focusing on the hominoid elbow joint. Specifically, morphometric variables of the proximal radius were derived from measurements from a sample of all genera of extant hominoids and casts of extinct hominin species. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on these data. Results show that early hominins are morphologically diverse and are not, as a group, similar to any one extant group. Instead, the fossils resemble Pan, Gorilla, and Hylobates, and are not like modern Homo sapiens or Pongo. This suggests that the morphology of Hylobates may reflect a morphotype for all later hominoids, thus complicating the functional interpretations of fossil hominins. The implications of these results are that the proximal radius is not a sensitive indicator of locomotor behavior among hominoids since the morphology in hylobatids and Gorilla and Pan is similar despite widely varying positional repertoires. Furthermore, inferences of function from form in extinct hominins can be drastically affected by the comparative outgroup selection. A re-evaluation of the functional morphology of the proximal radius in early hominins is addressed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Lineage-specific expansions of retroviral insertions within the genomes of African great apes but not humans and orangutans,"['Yohn, CT', 'Jiang, ZS', 'McGrath, SD', 'Hayden, KE', 'Khaitovich, P', 'Johnson, ME', 'Eichler, MY', 'McPherson, JD', 'Zhao, SY', 'Paabo, S', 'Eichler, EE']",PLOS BIOLOGY,10.1371/journal.pbio.0030110,APR 2005,48,"Retroviral infections of the germline have the potential to episodically alter gene function and genome structure during the course of evolution. Horizontal transmissions between species have been proposed, but little evidence exists for such events in the human/great ape lineage of evolution. Based on analysis of finished BAC chimpanzee genome sequence, we characterize a retroviral element (Pan troglodytes endogenous retrovirus 1 [PTERV1]) that has become integrated in the germline of African great ape and Old World monkey species but is absent from humans and Asian ape genomes. We unambiguously map 287 retroviral integration sites and determine that approximately 95.8% of the insertions occur at non-orthologous regions between closely related species. Phylogenetic analysis of the endogenous retrovirus reveals that the gorilla and chimpanzee elements share a monophyletic origin with a subset of the Old World monkey retroviral elements, but that the average sequence divergence exceeds neutral expectation for a strictly nuclear inherited DNA molecule. Within the chimpanzee, there is a significant integration bias against genes, with only 14 of these insertions mapping within intronic regions. Six out of ten of these genes, for which there are expression data, show significant differences in transcript expression between human and chimpanzee. Our data are consistent with a retroviral infection that bombarded the genomes of chimpanzees and gorillas independently and concurrently, 3-4 million years ago. We speculate on the potential impact of such recent events on the evolution of humans and great apes."
Osteocalcin protein sequences of Neanderthals and modern primates,"['Nielsen-Marsh, CM', 'Richards, MP', 'Hauschka, PV', 'Thomas-Oates, JE', 'Trinkaus, E', 'Pettitt, PB', 'Karavanic, I', 'Poinar, H', 'Collins, MJ']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0500450102,MAR 22 2005,45,"We report here protein sequences of fossil hominids, from two Neanderthals dating to approximate to 75,000 years old from Shanidar Cave in Iraq. These sequences, the oldest reported fossil primate protein sequences, are of bone osteocalcin, which was extracted and sequenced by using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Through a combination of direct sequencing and peptide mass mapping, we determined that Neanderthals have an osteocalcin amino acid sequence that is identical to that of modern humans. We also report complete osteocalcin sequences for chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and a partial sequence for orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), all of which are previously unreported. We found that the osteocalcin sequences of Neanderthals, modern human, chimpanzee, and orangutan are unusual among mammals in that the ninth amino acid is proline (Pro-9), whereas most species have hydroxyproline (Hyp-9). Posttranslational hydroxylation of Pro-9 in osteocalcin by prolyl-4-hydroxylase requires adequate concentrations of vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid), molecular O-2, Fe2+, and 2-oxoglutarate, and also depends on enzyme recognition of the target proline substrate consensus sequence Leu-Gly-Ala-Pro-9-Ala-Pro-Tyr occurring in most mammals. in five species with Pro-9-Val-10, hydroxylation is blocked, whereas in gorilla there is a mixture of Pro-9 and Hyp-9. We suggest that the absence of hydroxylation of Pro-9 in Pan, Pongo, and Homo may reflect response to a selective pressure related to a decline in vitamin C in the diet during omnivorous dietary adaptation, either independently or through the common ancestor of these species."
Catarrhine primate divergence dates estimated from complete mitochondrial genomes: concordance with fossil and nuclear DNA evidence,"['Raaum, RL', 'Sterner, KN', 'Noviello, CM', 'Stewart, CB', 'Disotell, TR']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.11.007,MAR 2005,156,"Accurate divergence date estimates improve scenarios of primate evolutionary history and aid in interpretation of the natural history of disease-causing agents. While molecule-based estimates of divergence dates of taxa within the superfamily Hominoidea (apes and humans) are common in the literature, few such estimates are available for the Cercopithecoidea (Old World monkeys), the sister taxon of the hominoids in the primate infraorder Catarrhini. To help fill this gap, we have sequenced the entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes from a representative of three cercopithecoid tribes, Cercopithecini (Chlorocebus aethiops), Colobini (Colobus guereza), and Presbytini (Trachypithecus obscurus), and analyzed these new data together with other catarrhine mtDNA genomes available in public databases.

Molecular divergence date estimates are dependent on calibration points gleaned from the paleontological record. We defined criteria for the selection of good calibration points and identified three points meeting these criteria: Homo-Pan, 6.0 Ma; Pongo-hominines, 14.0 Ma; hominoid/cercopithecoid, 23.0 Ma. Because a uniform molecular clock does not fit the catarrhine mtDNA data, we estimated divergence dates using a penalized likelihood and a Bayesian method, both of which take into account the effects of rate differences on lineages, phylogenetic tree structure, and multiple calibration points.

The penalized likelihood method applied to the coding regions of the mtDNA genome yielded the following divergence date estimates, with approximate 95% confidence intervals: cercopithecine-colobine, 16.2 (14.4-17.9) Ma; colobin-presbytin, 10.9 (9.6-12.3) Ma; cercopithecin-papionin, 11.6 (10.3-12.9) Ma; and Macaca-Papio, 9.8 (8.6-10.9) Ma. Within the hominoids, the following dates were inferred: hylobatid-hominid, 16.8 (15.0-18.5) Ma; Gorilla-Homo + Pan, 8.1 (7.1-9.0) Ma; Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus-P. p. abelii, 4.1 (3.5-4.7) Ma; and Pan troglodytes-P. paniscus, 2.4 (2.0-2.7) Ma. These dates were similar to those found using penalized likelihood on other subsets of the data, but slightly younger than several of the Bayesian estimates. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Ancient DNA samples from three Siberian woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) dating between 40,000 and 49,000 years before present were also tested for PCR amplification. Performance of HIST2H4 amplification were also compared with those of previously published universal PCRs (28S rRNA, 18S rRNA, and cytochrome b). Overall, 95% of species studied yielded an amplification product, including some old samples from gorilla and chimpanzees.

Fast adaptive coevolution of nuclear and mitochondrial subunits of ATP synthetase in orangutan,"['Bayona-Bafaluy, MP', 'Muller, S', 'Moraes, CT']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msi059,MAR 2005,26,"Nuclear and mitochondrial genomes have to work in concert to generate a functional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. We have previously shown that we could restore partial OXPHOS function when chimpanzee or gorilla mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were introduced into human cells lacking mtDNA. However, we were unable to maintain orangutan mitochondrial DNA in a human cell. We have now produced chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and baboon cells lacking mtDNA and attempted to introduce mtDNA from different apes into them. Surprisingly, we were able to maintain human mtDNA in an orangutan nuclear background, even though these cells showed severe OXPHOS abnormalities, including a complete absence of assembled ATP synthetase. Phylogenetic analysis of complex V mtDNA-encoded subunits showed that they are among the most evolutionarily divergent components of the mitochondrial genome between orangutan and the other apes. Our studies showed that adaptive coevolution of nuclear and mitochondrial components in apes can be fast and accelerate in recent branches of anthropoid primates."

In this article, I review a recent wave of comparative studies conducted with similar methodologies and similar theoretical frameworks on how two core components of human cognition - object permanence and gaze following - develop in different species. These comparative findings call for an integration of current competing accounts of developmental change. They further suggest that evolution has produced developmental devices capable at the same time of preserving core adaptive components, and opening themselves up to further adaptive change, not only in interaction with the external environment, but also in interaction with other co-developing cognitive systems."
"Evolution of human IgH3 ' EC duplicated structures: both enhancers HS1,2 are polymorphic with variation of transcription factor's consensus sites","['Giambra, V', 'Fruscalzo, A', 'Giufrea, M', 'Martinez-Labarga, C', 'Favaro, M', 'Rocchi, M', 'Frezza, D']",GENE,10.1016/j.gene.2004.10.009,FEB 14 2005,21,"The enhancer complex regulatory region at the 3' of the immunoglobulin heavy cluster (IgH3'EC) is duplicated in apes along with four constant genes and the region is highly conserved throughout humans. Both human IgH3'ECs consist of three loci high sensitive (HS) to DNAse I with enhancer activity. It is thus possible that the presence of structural divergences between the two IgH3'ECs and of relative polymorphisms correspond to functional regulatory changes. To analyse the polymorphisms of these almost identical regions, it resulted mandatory to identify the presence of divergent sequences, in order to select distinctive primers for specific PCR genomic amplifications. To this aim, we first compared the two entire IgH3'ECs in silicio, utilising the updated GenBank (GB) contigs, then we analysed the two IgH3'ECs by cloning and sequencing amplicons from independent genomes. In silicio analysis showed that several inversions, deletions and short insertions had occurred after the duplication. We analysed in detail, by sequencing specific regions, the polymorphisms occurring in enhancer HS1,2-A (which lies in IgH3'EC-1, 3' to the C alpha-1 gene) and in enhancer HS1,2-B (which lies in IgH3'EC-2, 3' to C alpha-2). Polymorphisms are due to the repetition (occurring one to four times) of a 38-bp sequence present at the 3' of the core of enhancers HS1,2. The structure of both human HS1,2 enhancers has revealed not yet described polymorphic features due to the presence of variable spacer elements separating the 38-bp repetitions and to variable external elements bordering the repetition cluster. We found that one of the external elements gave rise to a divergent allele 3 in the two clusters. The frequency of the different alleles of the two loci varies in the Italian population and allele 3 of both loci are very rare. The analysis of the Callicebus moloch, Gorilla gorilla and Pan troglodytes HS1,2 enhancers showed the transformation from the ancestral structure with the 31- to the 17-by external element in hominids.

The relevance of the polymorphisms in the HS1,2 enhancers is due to the variable number of binding sites for the transcription factors: NF-kappa B, CMYB, BSAP1/2, AP1/4, E47, MyoD and mu E5 and thus to the possible influence of these variations on switch, production of Ig and on maturation of B cells.

"Parasitological analyses of the male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda","['Muehlenbein, MP']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20106,FEB 2005,44,"Numerous intestinal parasites identified in populations of wild nonhuman primates can be pathogenic to humans. Furthermore, nonhuman primates are susceptible to a variety of human pathogens. Because of increasing human encroachment into previously nonimpacted forests, and the potential for disease transmission between human and nonhuman primate populations, further detailed investigations of primate ecological parasitology are warranted. For meaningful comparisons to be made, it is important for methods to be standardized across study sites. One aspect of methodological standardization is providing reliable estimates of parasite prevalence and knowing how many samples are needed to adequately estimate an individual's parasite prevalence. In this study the parasitic fauna of 37 adult, adolescent, and juvenile male chimpanzees from the Ngogo group, Kibale National Park, Uganda, were assessed from 121 fecal samples collected over a 3-month period. Twelve taxa of intestinal species (five helminth and seven protozoan) were recovered from the samples. The four most prevalent species were Troglodytella abrassarti (97.3%), Oesophagostomum sp. (81.1%), Strongyloides sp. (83.8%), and Entamoeba chattoni (70.3%). No one species was found in all samples from any one animal, and Troglodytella abrassarti, the most common intestinal organism, was found in all of the serial samples of only 69.4% of the chimpanzees. The cumulative species richness for individuals significantly increased for every sequential sample (up to three to four samples) taken per animal during this study. The results indicate that to accurately diagnose total intestinal infection and evaluate group prevalence, three to four sequential samples from each individual must be collected on nonconsecutive days. This conclusion applies only to short study periods in which possible seasonal effects are not taken into consideration. Validation of these results at different study sites in different regions with different climatic patterns is needed. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Survey of stereotypic behavior in prosimians,"['Tarou, LR', 'Bloomsmith, MA', 'Maple, TL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20107,FEB 2005,15,"Captive animals have been observed to perform a variety of stereotypic behaviors. However, little is known about stereotypic behavior in prosimians. We sent surveys to 96 AZA-accredited institutions to examine stereotypic behavior in these primates. Forty-eight surveys were returned, providing information on 440 individuals of 10 genera. According to the responses, 13.2% of the prosimians surveyed exhibited some form of stereotypic behavior. Pacing was the most common behavior. A logistic regression was used to examine intrinsic characteristics that might influence the performance of stereotypic behavior. The genus of the prosimian was a significant predictor of stereotypic behavior. Individuals of the genus Varecia and Microcebus were more likely to engage in stereotypic behavior than members of the other genera. Rearing history, age, and sex were not significant predictors of stereotypic behavior. To examine the influence of extrinsic variables on stereotypic behavior, we transformed the data into the percentage of individuals within the enclosure that were reported to exhibit stereotypic behavior, and analyzed them at the enclosure level using a general linear model (GLM) analysis of variance (ANOVA). The only environmental variable that significantly predicted stereotypic behavior was the frequency with which enrichment was provided. Frequent enrichment was provided to those exhibits with a higher percentage of prosimians that engaged in stereotypic behavior. The results of this survey suggest that stereotypic behavior in prosimians may be associated with intrinsic factors (i.e., individual or genus differences) in addition to extrinsic factors related to housing. This knowledge may be helpful in identifying the causes of and effective treatments for stereotypic behavior in prosimians. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
How does the zoo environment affect the behaviour of captive primates?,"['Hosey, GR']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2004.08.015,FEB 2005,70,"It is important for us to be able to understand the behaviour of primates in zoos for at least three reasons: firstly as a means towards ensuring their welfare. secondly to use that understanding to ensure a positive zoo experience for zoo visitors, and thirdly so that results of basic research undertaken on zoo primates can be properly evaluated. Often, however. the results of studies of how the zoo environment affects primate behaviour are not easy to interpret. We should recognize that the zoo environment is only one of a number of environments in which primates live. and should identify in which ways the zoo environment is different from those other environments. Here, it is suggested that the zoo environment may be defined in terms of three dimensions: regular presence of tame. numbers of unfamiliar humans, restricted space, and being managed. Individually all three of these can also be found in other. non-zoo environments, but all three together are characteristic of zoo environments. This paper is an initial attempt to compare studies of primate responses to the variables associated with each of these three dimensions across different primate environments.

Preliminary comparisons of male/male interactions within bachelor and breeding groups of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Pullen, PK']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2004.08.016,FEB 2005,9,"The establishment of bachelor groups of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in captivity was considered to be a necessary husbandry step in response to growing concern within the European and North American co-operative breeding programmes that breeding situations are limited [Harcourt, A.H.. 1988. Bachelor groups of gorillas in captivity: the situation in the wild. Dodo 25, 54-61: Johnstone-Scott, R.A., 1988. The potential for establishing bachelor groups of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Dodo 25. 61-66]. Comparisons of behaviour between bachelor groups and breeding groups. targeting situations of social conflict, give an insight into the functions of male/male interactions within bachelor groups.

Observations were undertaken at two zoos in the United Kingdom. one housing a bachelor group and one housing a breeding group of G. g. gorilla. Data were, collected on the frequencies of escalated and non-escalated aggression (aggression), display, play-fighting and displacement (avoidance of aggression), and food-sharing and resource-sharing behaviours (tolerance) between males in three age-classes: silverback, black-back and sub-adult.

Significant differences in behaviour were found between the three age-classes. In both the bachelor (Kruskal-Wallis: K-[2] = 13.58, p < 0.001, post hoc critical value = 9.43) and breeding group (K-[2] = 14.50 p < 0.001, post hoc critical value = 9.87) the silverback exhibited higher levels of escalated aggression than the sub-adults and higher levels of non-escalated aggression than either the blackbacks or the sub-adults (K-[2] = 14.90, p < 0.001. post hoc critical value = 9.43: K-[2] = 21.16 p < 0.001, post hoc critical value = 9.87 for bachelor and breeding groups, respectively). The bachelor group sub-adult initiated significantly lower numbers of displacements (approach-retreat behaviour) than either the silverback or the blackback (K-[2] = 9.72, p < 0.01, post hoc critical value = 9.43), whereas in the breeding group the sub-adult only initiated significantly lower numbers of displacements than the silverback (K-[2] = 11.52, p < 0.01, post hoc critical value = 9.87). Significant differences in play-fighting between the age-classes were only seen in the breeding group, the blackback initiating more play-fights than the silverback (K-[2] = 8.63, p < 0.01, post hoc critical value = 9.87).

Significant differences in behaviour were also found between the groups. In all age-classes the breeding group individuals exhibited higher levels of chest beat display than the bachelor group (Mann-Whitney: U-[10.10] = 9.00, p < 0.01; U-[10.10] = 26.0, p < 0.05; U-[10.10] = 10-5, p = 0.001 for silverbacks, blackbacks and sub-adults, respectively). The breeding group silverback also showed higher levels of non-escalated aggression than the bachelor group silverback (U-[10.10] = 20.0, p < 0.05). The blackbacks in the bachelor group exhibited higher levels of displacements than the breeding group blackback (U-[10.10] = 13.00, p < 0.01).

These results indicate possible differences between bachelor and breeding groups of captive gorillas in their methods of managing social interaction. However, these results are based on a small sample size and represent the initial findings of a larger study. They should be treated with caution until the full study is completed.

We assessed the conservation significance of this site using data on wildlife and habitat conditions collected during a comprehensive primate survey. Scores were attributed to a system of variables and sub-variables to assess the conservation value of the proposed park at the national level. We identified a total of 10 diurnal primate species ( eight monkeys, two apes) and flooded forests were considered as a key habitat for primates as they hold a greater number of species than terra firma forests. We recorded the presence of 12 mammal species listed under the 2000 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, including four classified as Endangered ( two Primates, one Proboscidae and one Insectivora). We found that the conservation value of the proposed park ranked second out of the 15 existing protected areas of the country. Primate abundance was found to be generally higher than in the nearby Dzanga-Ndoki National Park ( the sole other park located in the same vegetation unit), in particular for the species occurring in flooded forests. This highlights the fact that the proposed Mbaere-Bodingue National Park is an important area for the conservation of species associated with flooded forests, a habitat which is currently underrepresented in the national protected area system. Poaching pressure was identified as the main current threat to the integrity of the proposed park."

F. MacNeilage, M. G. Studdert-Kennedy, and B. Lindblom (1987) proposed a progression for handedness in primates that was supposed to account for the evolution of a right bias in human handedness. To test this proposal, the authors performed meta-analyses on 62 studies that provided individual data (representing 31 species: 9 prosimians, 6 New World monkeys, 10 Old World monkeys, 2 lesser apes, and 4 greater apes), of the 118 studies of primate handedness published since 1987. Although evidence of a population-level left-handed bias for prosimians and Old World monkeys supports P. F.

Something other than primate handedness may have been the evolutionary precursor of the right bias in hand-use distribution among hominids."
From the ape's dilemma to the weanling's dilemma: early weaning and its evolutionary context,"['Kennedy, GE']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.09.005,FEB 2005,70,"Although humans have a longer period of infant dependency than other hominoids, human infants, in natural fertility societies, are weaned far earlier than any of the great apes: chimps and orangutans wean, on average, at about 5 and 7.7 years, respectively, while humans wean, on average, at about 2.5 years. Assuming that living great apes demonstrate the ancestral weaning pattern, modern humans display a derived pattern that requires explanation, particularly since earlier weaning may result in significant hazards for a child. Clearly, if selection had favored the survival of the child, humans would wean later like other hominoids; selection, then, favored some trait other than the child's survival. It is argued here that our unique pattern of prolonged, early brain growth-the neurological basis for human intellectual ability-cannot be sustained much beyond one year by a human mother's milk alone, and thus early weaning, when accompanied by supplementation with more nutritious adult foods, is vital to the ontogeny of our larger brain, despite the associated dangers. Therefore, the child's intellectual development, rather than its survival, is the primary focus of selection. Consumption of more nutritious foods-derived from animal protein-increased by ca. 2.6 myr ago when a group of early hominins displayed two important behavioral shifts relative to ancestral forms: the recognition that a carcass represented a new and valuable food source-potentially larger than the usual hunted prey-and the use of stone tools to improve access to that food source. The shift in the hominin ""prey image"" to the carcass and the use of tools for butchery increased the amount of protein and calories available, irrespective of the local landscape. However, this shift brought hominins into competition with carnivores, increasing mortality among young adults and necessitating a number of social responses, such as alloparenting. The increased acquisition of meat ca. 2.6 Ma had significant effects on the later course of human evolution and may have initiated the origin of the genus Homo. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Molecular epidemiology of simian T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 in wild and captive sooty mangabeys,"['Traina-Dorge, VL', 'Lorino, R', 'Gormus, BJ', 'Metzger, M', 'Telfer, P', 'Richardson, D', 'Robertson, DL', 'Marx, PA', 'Apetrei, C']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.4.2541-2548.2005,FEB 2005,8,"A study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV) isolates within the long-established Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC) colony of sooty mangabeys (SMs; Cercocebus atys). Serological analysis determined that 22 of 39 animals (56%) were positive for STLV type 1 (STLV-1). A second group of thirteen SM bush meat samples from Sierra Leone in Africa was also included and tested only by PCR. Twenty-two of 39 captive animals (56%) and 3 of 13 bush meat samples (23%) were positive for STLV-1, as shown by testing with PCR. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of viral strains obtained demonstrated that STLV-1 strains from SMs (STLV-Ism strains) from the TNPRC colony and Sierra Leone formed a single cluster together with the previously reported STLV-1sm strain from the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. These data confirm that Africa is the origin for TNPRC STLV-Ism and suggest that Sierra Leone is the origin for the SM colonies in the United States. The TNPRC STLV-Ism strains further divided into two subclusters, suggesting STLV-1sm infection of two original founder SMs at the time of their importation into the United States. STLV-1sm diversity in the TNPRC colony matches the high diversity of SIVsm in the already reported colony. The lack of correlation between the lineage of the simian immunodeficiency virus from SMs (SIVsm) and the STLV-1sm subcluster distribution of the TNPRC strains suggests that intracolony transmissions of both viruses were independent events."
3D-kinematics of vertical climbing in hominoids,"['Isler, K']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10419,JAN 2005,45,"Vertical climbing has played an important role in theories about the evolution of habitual bipedalism in early hommids and of locomotor specialization in hominoids. However, empirical data on vertical climbing in nonhuman primates are scarce, especially regarding kinematics. In this paper, the kinematics of flexed-elbow vertical climbing of four hominoid species are reported: western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), bonobos (Pan paniscus), Sumatran orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus abelii), and yellow-cheeked crested gibbons (Hylobates concolor gabriellae). The climbing sequences were recorded simultaneously by four digital video cameras in European zoos. Analyzed parameters include intersegmental flexion/extension angles of the shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee joints, horizontal abduction/adduction angles of the upper arm and thigh, and distance of the body center of gravity from the substrate. Analyses reveal that differences in climbing kinematics between individuals of different age/sex classes of one species are mostly size-related, whereas interspecific differences reflect specific locomotor adaptations. The climbing kinematics of bonobos and gorillas are more similar to each other than to those of orangutans or gibbons. The range of motion of the major limb joints in adult orangutans is larger than in African apes, although the hip is not more extended. Gibbons horizontally abduct the arm more and the thigh less during climbing than any of the great apes. These results allow us to question some qualitative descriptions of vertical climbing kinematics reported in the literature, and to discuss implications for the evolution of locomotor adaptations in hominoids.

In addition, we focus on the underlying processes of social cognition, including learning mechanisms and flexibility of gesture use (such as adjustment to the attentional state of the recipient). The subjects were seven bonobos, aged 1-8 years, living in two different groups in captivity. Twenty distinct gestures (one auditory, eight tactile, and 11 visual) were recorded. We found individual differences and similar degrees of concordance of the gestural repertoires between and within groups, which provide evidence that ontogenetic ritualization is the main learning process involved. There is suggestive evidence, however, that some form of social learning may be responsible for the acquisition of special gestures. Overall, the present study establishes that the gestural repertoire of bonobos can be characterized as flexible and adapted to various communicative circumstances, including the attentional state of the recipient. Differences from and similarities to the other African ape species are discussed. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Nucleotide sequence comparison of a chromosome rearrangement on human chromosome 12 and the corresponding ape chromosomes,"['Shimada, MK', 'Kim, CG', 'Kitano, T', 'Ferrell, RE', 'Kohara, Y', 'Saitou, N']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000080805,2005,15,"Chromosome rearrangement has been considered to be important in the evolutionary process. Here, we demonstrate the evolutionary relationship of the rearranged human chromosome 12 and the corresponding chromosome XII in apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon) by examining PCR products derived from the breakpoints of inversions and by conducting shotgun sequencing of a gorilla fosmid clone containing the breakpoint and a ""duplicated segment"" (duplicon). We confirmed that a pair of 23-kb duplicons flank the breakpoints of inversions on the long and short arms of chimpanzee chromosome XII. Although only the 23-kb duplicon on the long arm of chimpanzee chromosome XII and its telomeric flanking sequence are found to be conserved among the hominoids (human, great apes, and gibbons), the duplicon on the short arm of chimpanzee chromosome XII is suggested to be the result of a duplication from that on the long arm. Furthermore, the shotgun sequencing of a gorilla fosmid indicated that the breakpoint on the long arm of the gorilla is located at a different position 1.9 kb from that of chimpanzee. The region is flanked by a sequence homologous to that of human chromosome 6q22. Our findings and sequence analysis suggest a close relationship between segmental duplication and chromosome rearrangement (or breakpoint of inversion) in Hominoidea.

Breakpoint analysis of the pericentric inversion between chimpanzee chromosome 10 and the homologous chromosome 12 in humans,"['Kehrer-Sawatzki, H', 'Sandig, CA', 'Goidts, V', 'Hameister, H']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000080806,2005,32,"During this study, we analysed the pericentric inversion that distinguishes human chromosome 12 (HSA12) from the homologous chimpanzee chromosome (PTR10). Two large chimpanzee-specific duplications of 86 and 23 kb were observed in the breakpoint regions, which most probably occurred associated with the inversion. The inversion break in PTR10p caused the disruption of the SLCO1B3 gene in exon 11. However, the 86-kb duplication includes the functional SLCO1B3 locus, which is thus retained in the chimpanzee, although inverted to PTR10q. The second duplication spans 23 kb and does not contain expressed sequences. Eleven genes map to a region of about 1 Mb around the breakpoints. Six of these eleven genes are not among the differentially expressed genes as determined previously by comparing the human and chimpanzee transcriptome of fibroblast cell lines, blood leukocytes, liver and brain samples. These findings imply that the inversion did not cause major expression differences of these genes. Comparative FISH analysis with BACs spanning the inversion breakpoints in PTR on metaphase chromosomes of gorilla (GGO) confirmed that the pericentric inversion of the chromosome 12 homologs in GGO and PTR have distinct breakpoints and that humans retain the ancestral arrangement. These findings coincide with the trend observed in hominoid karyotype evolution that humans have a karyotype close to an ancestral one, while African great apes present with more derived chromosome arrangements.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization to chromosomes as a tool to understand human and primate genome evolution,"['Wienberg, J']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000080811,2005,23,"For the last 15 years molecular cytogenetic techniques have been extensively used to study primate evolution. Molecular probes were helpful to distinguish mammalian chromosomes and chromosome segments on the basis of their DNA content rather than solely on morphological features such as banding patterns. Various landmark rearrangements have been identified for most of the nodes in primate phylogeny while chromosome banding still provides helpful reference maps. Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) techniques were used with probes of different complexity including chromosome painting probes, probes derived from chromosome sub-regions and in the size of a single gene. Since more recently, in silico techniques have been applied to trace down evolutionarily derived chromosome rearrangements by searching the human and mouse genome sequence databases. More detailed breakpoint analyses of chromosome rearrangements that occurred during higher primate evolution also gave some insights into the molecular changes in chromosome rearrangements that occurred in evolution. Hardly any ""fusion genes"" as known from chromosome rearrangements in cancer cells or dramatic ""position effects"" of genes transferred to new sites in primate genomes have been reported yet. Most breakpoint regions have been identified within gene poor areas rich in repetitive elements and/or low copy repeats ( segmental duplications). The progress in various molecular and molecular-cytogenetic approaches including the recently launched chimpanzee genome project suggests that these new tools will have a significant impact on the further understanding of human genome evolution.

The chromosomal bands that are boundaries of ancestral segments are identified. We have analyzed from data published in the literature 35 different primate species from 19 genera, using the order Scandentia, as well as other published mammalian species as out-groups, and propose an ancestral chromosome number of 2n = 54 for primates, which includes the following chromosomal forms: 1(a+c(1)), 1(b+ c(2)), 2a, 2b, 3/21, 4, 5, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9, 10a, 10b, 11, 12a/22a, 12b/22b, 13, 14/15, 16a, 16b, 17, 18, 19a, 19b, 20 and X and Y. From this analysis, we have been able to point out the human chromosome bands more ""prone"" to breakage during the evolutionary pathways and/or pathology processes. We have observed that 89.09% of the human chromosome bands, which are boundaries for ancestral chromosome segments, contain common fragile sites and/or intrachromosomal telomeric-like sequences. A more in depth analysis of twelve different human chromosomes has allowed us to determine that 62.16% of the chromosomal bands implicated in inversions and 100% involved in fusions/fissions correspond to fragile sites, intrachromosomal telomeric-like sequences and/or bands significantly affected by X irradiation. In addition, 73% of the bands affected in pathological processes are co-localized in bands where fragile sites, intrachromosomal telomeric-like sequences, bands significantly affected by X irradiation and/or evolutionary chromosomal bands have been described. Our data also support the hypothesis that chromosomal breakages detected in pathological processes are not randomly distributed along the chromosomes, but rather concentrate in those important evolutionary chromosome bands which correspond to fragile sites and/or intrachromosomal telomeric-like sequences.

A duplication of sequences homologous to human 1p36.1 could be detected in PPY plus an additional signal on PPY 16q. The region homologous to HSA 1p36.1 is also duplicated in HLA, and split onto chromosomes 7q and 9p; the region homologous to HSA 1q21/1p12 is present as one region on 5q. Additionally, the breakpoint of a small pericentric inversion in the evolution of human chromosome 1 compared to other great ape species could be refined. In summary, the results obtained here are in concordance with previous reports; however, there is evidence for a deletion of regions homologous to human 1p34.2 -->p34.1 during evolution in the Pongidae branch after separation of PPY.

Comparative mapping of human claudin-1 (CLDN1) in great apes,"['Nanda, I', 'Kramer, F', 'Weber, BHF', 'Schempp, W', 'Schmid, M']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000080821,2005,0,"The gene encoding claudin-1 (CLDN1) has been mapped to human chromosome 3 (HSA3; 3q28 -->q29) using a radiation hybrid panel. Employing fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) we here show that a human P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) containing CLDN1 detects the orthologous sites in chromosomes of the great apes, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. Furthermore, the chromosomal position of CLDN1 was determined in mouse chromosomes by FISH. The position of fluorescent signals is confined to a single chromosomal site in both great apes and mouse and in each case maps to the chromosomal region that has conserved synteny with HSA3 (PTR2q28, GGO2q28, PPY2q38 and MMU16B1).

Genetic evidence of a strong functional constraint of neurotrypsin during primate evolution,"['Xu, HL', 'Su, B']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000081523,2005,4,"Neurotrypsin is one of the extra-cellular serine proteases that are predominantly expressed in the brain and involved in neuronal development and function. Mutations in humans are associated with autosomal recessive non-syndromic mental retardation (MR). We studied the molecular evolution of neurotrypsin by sequencing the coding region of neurotrypsin in 11 representative non-human primate species covering great apes, lesser apes, Old World monkeys and New World monkeys. Our results demonstrated a strong functional constraint of neurotrypsin that was caused by strong purifying selection during primate evolution, an implication of an essential functional role of neurotrypsin in primate cognition. Further analysis indicated that the purifying selection was in fact acting on the SRCR domains of neurotrypsin, which mediate the binding activity of neurotrypsin to cell surface or extracellular proteins. In addition, by comparing primates with three other mammalian orders, we demonstrated that the absence of the first copy of the SRCR domain (exon 2 and 3) in mouse and rat was due to the deletion of this segment in the murine lineage.

Inferring the mode of speciation from genomic data: A study of the great apes,"['Osada, N', 'Wu, CI']",GENETICS,10.1534/genetics.104.029231,JAN 2005,60,"The strictly allopatric model of speciation makes definable predictions on the pattern of divergence, one of which is the uniformity in the divergence time across genomic regions. Using 345 coding and 143 intergenic sequences from the African great apes, we were able to reject the mill hypothesis that the divergence time in the coding sequences (CDSs) and intergenic sequences (IGSs) is the same between human and chimpanzee. The conclusion is further supported by the analysis of whole-genome sequences between these species. The difference suggests a prolonged period of genetic exchange during the formation of these two species. Because the analysis should be generally applicable, collecting DNA sequence data from many genomic regions between closely related species should help to settle the debate over the prevalence of the allopatric mode of speciation."
Patterns of size sexual dimorphism in Australopithecus afarensis: Another look,"['Lee, SH']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jchb.2005.07.001,2005,7,"Size sexual dimorphism is one of the major components of morphological variation and has been associated with socioecology and behavioral variables such as mating patterns, Although several studies have addressed the magnitude and pattern of sexual dimorphism in Australopithecus afarensis, one of the earliest hominids, consensus has yet to be reached. This paper uses assigned resampling method, a data resampling method to estimate the magnitude of sexual dimorphism without relying on individual sex assessments, to examine the fossil hominid sample from Hadar. Two questions are asked: first, whether sexual dimorphism in a selected sample of skeletal elements of A. afarensis is the same as that in living humans, chimpanzees, or gorillas; and second, whether different skeletal elements reflect variation in sexual dimorphism in the same way. All possible metric variables were used as data in applying the method, including seven variables from three elements (mandibular canine, humerus, femur). Analyses show that A. afarensis is similar in size sexual dimorphism to gorillas in femoral variables, to humans in humeral variables, and to chimpanzees in canine variables. The results of this study are compatible with the hypothesis that the pattern of sexual dimorphism in A. afarensis is different from any that are observed in living humans or apes.

Sex differences in the relative lengths of metacarpals and metatarsals in gorillas and chimpanzees,"['McFadden, D', 'Bracht, MS']",HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR,10.1016/j.yhbeh.2004.08.013,JAN 2005,29,"Sex differences other than the simple dimorphism in size were documented for the metapodials of two primate species. Lengths of metacarpals and metatarsals were obtained from the skeletons of 64 gorillas and 42 chimpanzees. Length ratios were constructed for all possible pairings of the five bones in each individual hand and foot. For both species, several of these length ratios exhibited substantial differences between the sexes. Body size was not the basis for these sex differences; when specimens of similar size were compared, the sex differences remained. In humans, length ratios for the fingers and toes also have previously been demonstrated to exhibit sex differences, and the length ratio for the index and ring fingers (the 213:413 ratio) has been shown to correlate with various medical conditions. Various facts suggest that length ratios in human digits are associated with androgen exposure, probably during prenatal development. For gorillas, the metacarpal length ratio showing the largest sex difference was 4Mc:5Mc in both hands, and the metatarsal length ratio showing the largest sex difference was 1Mt:2Mt in the left foot. Sex differences in length ratios also existed for chimpanzees, but they were generally smaller than for gorillas. Apparently, both gorillas and chimpanzees are affected by developmental mechanisms, possibly androgenic mechanisms, similar to those in humans. Analyses of previous measurements [Susman, R.L., 1979 Comparative and functional morphology of hominoid fingers. Am. J, Phys. Anthropol. 50, 215-236] revealed that all components of the rays are not affected equally by whatever mechanisms are responsible for the sex differences in length ratios. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Nuclear insertions help and hinder inference of the evolutionary history of gorilla mtDNA,"['Thalmann, O', 'Serre, D', 'Hofreiter, M', 'Lukas, D', 'Eriksson, J', 'Vigilant, L']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02382.x,JAN 2005,34,"Numts are fragments of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that have been translocated to the nucleus, where they can persist while their mitochondrial counterparts continue to rapidly evolve. Thus, numts represent 'molecular fossils' useful for comparison with mitochondrial variation, and are particularly suited for studies of the fast-evolving hypervariable segment of the mitochondrial control region (HV1). Here we used information from numts found in western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei) to estimate that these two species diverged about 1.3 million years ago (Ma), an estimate similar to recent calculations for the divergence of chimpanzee and bonobo. We also describe the sequence of a gorilla numt still possessing a segment lost from all contemporary gorilla mtDNAs. In contrast to that sequence, many numts of the HV1 are highly similar to authentic mitochondrial organellar sequences, making it difficult to determine whether purported mitochondrial sequences truly derive from that genome. We used all available organellar HV1 and corresponding numt sequences from gorillas in a phylogenetic analysis aimed at distinguishing these two types of sequences. Numts were found in several clades in the tree. This, in combination with the fact that only a limited amount of the extant variation in gorillas has been sampled, suggests that categorization of new sequences by the indirect means of phylogenetic comparison would be prone to uncertainty. We conclude that for taxa such as gorillas that contain numerous numts, direct approaches to the authentication of HV1 sequences, such as amplification strategies relying upon the circularity of the mtDNA molecule, remain necessary."

Man and apes: Linguistic abilities and dialogue potentialities,"['Butovskaya, ML']",ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL,NA,JAN 2005,0,"The paper presents a review of previous and recent studies in the field of evolution of cognitive abilities in large apes and humans and discusses an intellectual potentialities of large apes related to their success in acquisition of language. The recent data on the language in apes have confirmed the presence of premises for symbolic abilities in chimpanzee, bonobo, and gorilla. Large apes demonstrate the abilities for deception and humor, and they may have rudimentary mind. They can teach language each other. At least, some apes (Kanzi, Panbanisha, and others) are able to rate symbols by semantic function and possess some rudiments of grammar. Apes can associate concepts with arbitrary symbols but they have a limited mastery of syntax. Their linguistic abilities are comparable to those in very young children who begin to acquire language. Human language is based on a number of specialized cognitive skill. It may be developed in the process of evolution by the normal Darwinian fashion like other morphological structures. The evolutionary pathways connecting cognitive and communicative abilities of apes and present-day humans, need to be reconstructed in the future. The information provided by the ape language studies may be of substantial importance in this respect."
Detecting genetic drift versus selection in human evolution,"['Ackermann, RR', 'Cheverud, JM']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0405919102,DEC 28 2004,69,"Recent paleoanthropological discoveries reveal a diverse, potentially speciose human fossil record. Such extensive morphological diversity results from the action of divergent evolutionary forces on an evolving lineage. Here, we apply quantitative evolutionary theory to test whether random evolutionary processes alone can explain the morphological diversity seen among fossil australopith and early Homo crania from the Plio-Pleistocene. We show that although selection may have played an important role in diversifying hominin facial morphology in the late Pliocene, this is not the case during the early evolution of the genus Homo, where genetic drift was probably the primary force responsible for facial diversification."
Wide faces or large canines?

We resolve this paradox by examining sex differences in hominoid facial morphology. We show that chimpanzees, but not gorillas, exhibit clear sexual dimorphism in face width, over and above that expected based on sex differences in body size. We show that this facial dimorphism, expressed as an index, is negatively correlated with canine dimorphism among anthropoid primates. Our findings suggest that a lack of canine dimorphism in anthropoids is not owing to weak sexual selection, but rather is associated with strong sexual selection for broader face width. Enlarged cheekbones are linked with attractiveness in humans, and we propose that the evolution of a broad face and loss of large canines in hominid males results from mate choice."

Therefore we compared habitat types and forest composition between two locations to investigate differences that may influence ecological conditions for large mammals, including endangered mountain gorillas. We demonstrate that there is considerable intersite variation in habitat types and spatial and temporal availability of vegetation resources of which the most apparent are the differences in species composition of plants and fruit availability. Buhoma (the lower altitude site) has a greater diversity of plant species and higher tree and shrub densities, yet has a much lower density of herbaceous vegetation eaten by gorillas compared with Ruhija. Fruit availability is significantly higher throughout the year in Buhoma compared with Ruhija. Both sites exhibit seasonal variation in fruit availability although they do not follow the same seasonal pattern, perhaps because of inherent asynchronous phenological differences amongst individual tree species. The results of this study are important because distribution and abundance of both terrestrial herbaceous vegetation and fruit resources are believed to influence aspects of feeding ecology for large mammals."
Patterns of tooth crown size and shape variation in great apes and humans and species recognition in the hominid fossil record,"['Scott, JE', 'Lockwood, CA', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10406,DEC 2004,11,"It has been suggested that patterns of craniodental variation in living hominids (Gorilla, Homo, Pan, and Pongo) may be useful for evaluating variation in fossil hominid assemblages. Using this approach, a fossil sample exhibiting a pattern of variation that deviates from one shared among living taxa would be regarded as taxonomically heterogeneous. Here we examine patterns of tooth crown size and shape variation in great apes and humans to determine 1) if these taxa share a pattern of dental variation, and 2) if such a pattern can reliably discriminate between samples that contain single species and those that contain multiple species. We use parametric and nonparametric correlation methods to establish the degree of pattern similarity among taxa, and randomization tests to assess their statistical significance. The results of this study show that extant hominids do not share a pattern of dental size variation, and thus these taxa cannot be used to generate expectations for patterns of size variation in fossil hominid species. The hominines (Gorilla, Homo, and Pan) do share a pattern of shape variation in the mandibular dentition; however, Pongo is distinct, and thus it is unclear which, if either, pattern should be expected in fossil hominids. Moreover, in this case, most combined-species samples exhibit patterns of shape variation that are similar to those for single hominine species samples. Thus, although a common pattern of shape variation is present in the mandibular dentition, it is not useful for recognizing taxonomically mixed paleontological samples. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Use of gesture sequences in chimpanzees,"['Liebal, K', 'Call, J', 'Tomasello, M']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20087,DEC 2004,78,"Gestural communication in a group of 19 captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) was observed, with particular attention paid to gesture sequences (combinations). A complete inventory of gesture sequences is reported. The majority of these sequences were repetitions of the same gestures, which were often tactile gestures and often occurred in play contexts. Other sequences combined gestures within a modality (visual, auditory, or tactile) or across modalities. The emergence of gesture sequences was ascribed to a recipient's lack of responsiveness rather than a premeditated combination of gestures to increase the efficiency of particular gestures. In terms of audience effects, the chimpanzees were sensitive to the attentional state of the recipient, and therefore used visually-based gestures mostly when others were already attending, as opposed to tactile gestures, which were used regardless of whether the recipient was attending or not. However, the chimpanzees did not use gesture sequences in which the first gesture served to attract the recipient's visual attention before they produced a second gesture that was visually-based. Instead, they used other strategies, such as locomoting in front of the recipient, before they produced a visually-based gesture. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Inter- and intra-specific variation in the ontogeny of the hominoid facial skeleton: testing assumptions of ontogenetic variability,"['Vioarsdottir, US', 'Cobb, S']",ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER,NA,DEC 2004,16,"In this paper we use geometric morphometric techniques to test two assumptions that are commonly made about variations in facial ontogeny: closely related species, or members of the same species, will share a common early post-natal ontogeny; and closely related species, or members of the same species, will share a common ontogenetic scaling trajectory. To test these assumptions we use four species of hominines: Homo sapiens, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus. The first assumption is falsified, both inter- and intra-specifically, using discriminant analysis with crossvalidation of subadults prior to the onset of the eruption of the permanent dentition. The second assumption only holds true for inter-specific comparisons of ontogenetic scaling trajectories, while assumptions of variation in intra-specific scaling trajectories are falsified with these data."
A geometric morphometric assessment of hominoid crania: conservative African apes and their liberal implications,"['McNulty, KP']",ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER,10.1016/S0940-9602(04)80077-3,DEC 2004,5,"This study examined the cranial affinities of all extant hominoids using 3D geometric morphometric analysis. A least squares Procrustean superimposition was used to eliminate differences due to location, orientation, and size. Because of a persistent correlation between centroid size and shape variation, an allometric size adjustment was also applied to these data. Phenetic affinities were then examined through a battery of multivariate statistical analyses.

Results of this study indicate a strong affinity between Hylobates and Gorilla; Pan is also similar to these genera, while Pongo and Homo are each very different. The autapomorphic morphologies of orangutan and modern human crania have been well established from previous studies. The similarity between Hylobates and Gorilla, however, has important implications for studies of hominoid morphology. First, these results suggest that African ape crania - and particularly those of Gorilla - retain an overall morphology that is conservative among hominoids. Secondly, this similarity suggests that character coding of cranial features may tend to overestimate the degree of polymorphism among extant apes. This study concludes that allometry may play a greater role in the morphogenesis of hominoid cranial variation than has been previously thought. While this problem likely has negligible impact on systematic studies of extant hominoids, it seriously affects our ability to place fossil taxa within a phylogenetic framework."
Craniofacial sexual dimorphism patterns and allometry among extant hominids,"['Schaefer, K', 'Mitteroecker, P', 'Gunz, P', 'Bernhard, M', 'Bookstein, FL', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER,10.1016/S0940-9602(04)80086-4,DEC 2004,35,"Craniofacial sexual dimorphism in primates varies in both magnitude and pattern among species. In the past two decades, there has been an increasing emphasis in exploring the correlations of these patterns with taxonomy and the variation in patterns within and among the craniofacial regions.

Scrutinising these relationships for hominids, we decompose the craniofacial morphology in five taxa: Homo sapiens, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus. 3D coordinates of 35 traditional landmarks and 61 semilandmarks, covering five ridge curves, are measured for each of 268 adult and sub-adult specimens and analysed using geometric morphometric methods.

A multivariate analysis in size-shape space shows that ontogenetic scaling contributes to the development of sexual dimorphism in all five taxa, but to a varying extent. In absolute as well as in relative terms P pygmaeus shows the greatest allometric component, followed by G. gorilla. Homo is intermediate, while in Pan the non-allometric constituent part contributes a large fraction to the actual sexual dimorphism, most markedly in the pygmy chimpanzee. An eigendecomposition of the five vectors of sexual dimorphism reveals two dimensions independent of allometry. One separates orang-utan sexual dimorphism from the African apes and Homo, and the other differentiates between the great apes and Homo with Pan mediating.

We discuss these patterns and speculate on their use as characters for taxonomic analysis in the fossil record."
"A biomechanical approach to craniofacial shape in primates, using FESA","['Preuschoft, H', 'Witzel, U']",ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER,10.1016/S0940-9602(04)80071-2,DEC 2004,11,"The head of a land-living vertebrate is exposed to the forces of acceleration, in particular the permanent earth acceleration (= gravity) and the muscle-generated bite and chewing forces. In mammals, at least, the latter seem to play the dominant role. Bite forces are applied to the teeth and close the circle of forces by passing through the facial skeleton to the insertions of the mandibular adductors. With the aid of three-dimensional Finite Element Systems Analysis (FESA), the stress flows in homogenous bodies are investigated, whereby the braincase, the orbits and the nasal channel are taken as preconditions. The muscle insertions are varied systematically. The resulting stress flows in all cases turn out to be very similar to the bony structures of a skull. Little or not stressed parts of the available homogenous body indicate the external surface or hollow spaces (= sinuses) inside the skull. The possible applications of forces (i.e., the forms and positions of the dental arcade in relation to the braincase) determine the pathways along which the forces are transmitted. It seems that the factors mentioned above as preconditions represent the selective pressures exerted by the lifestyle of the animal and its environment (= ecological conditions). The results that can be obtained by our deductive approach in comparison to inductive, experimental procedures are discussed briefly."
On the scaling relationship between enamel prisin length and enamel thickness in primate molars: a comment,"['Macho, GA']",ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER,10.1016/S0940-9602(04)80073-6,DEC 2004,3,"As part of a larger study we developed a computer programme which allows the recreation of the complex 3-dimensional arrangement of prisms. Data presented in these earlier publications are re-analyzed to assess the relationship between projected prism length (i.e., enamel thickness) and the true prism length. Across primates, proportional prism deviation increases as the enamel becomes thicker. This supports suggestions that prism decussation may be particularly marked in large-bodied and thick-enameled species. There are differences, however, in scaling relationships between species, which correspond to the species' dietary adaptations. Finally, the findings highlight the importance of employing species-specific correction factors for the calculation of prism length (i.e., life-span of the ameloblast) for life history enquiry."

Recent molecular cytogenetic results - especially those from the assumed oldest clade, the Afrotheria - suggest an ancestral karyotype that would calculate the 'default' frequency of gross rearrangements to less than two changes within 10 million years of mammalian evolution. The main changes are the fission, movement and subsequent fusion of large chromosome segments or of chromosome arms. Reciprocal translocations are the exception. Chromosome numbers may have increased or decreased significantly in this fusion/fission process but, in most instances, the main architecture still remains evident. There are, however, some exceptions in mammals with extremely derived karyotypes."

Questionnaire data were collected to assess whether persons kept wild animal pets; hunted and butchered wild game; had experienced bites, scratches, or injuries from live animals-, or had been injured during hunting or butchering. While all villages had substantial exposure to nonhuman primates, higher rates of exposure were seen in lowland forest sites. The study demonstrates that exposure is not limited to small groups of hunters. A high percentage of rural villagers report exposure to nonhuman primate blood and body fluids and risk acquiring infectious diseases."

Analysis of the human and ape foot during bipedal standing with implications for the evolution of the foot,"['Wang, WJ', 'Crompton, RH']",JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.02.036,DEC 2004,23,"The ratio of the power arm (the distance from the heel to the talocrural joint) to the load arm (that from the talocrural joint to the distal head of the metatarsals), or RPL, differs markedly between the human and ape foot.

This study evaluates the effect of these two differences on biomechanical effectiveness during bipedal standing, estimating the forces acting across the talocrural and tarsometatarsal joints, and attempts to identify which type of foot is optimal for bipedal standing. A simple model of the foot musculoskeletal system was built to represent the geometric and force relationships in the foot during bipedal standing, and measurements for a variety of human and ape feet applied. The results show that: (1) an RPL of around 40% (as is the case in the human foot) minimizes required muscle force at the talocrural joint; (2) the presence of an high arch in the human foot reduces forces in the plantar musculature and aponeurosis; and (3) the human foot has a lower total of force in joints and Muscles than do the ape feet. These results indicate that the proportions of the human foot, and the height of the medial arch are indeed better optimized for bipedal standing than those of apes, further suggesting that their current state is to some extent the product of positive selection for enhanced bipedal standing during the evolution of the foot.

Gastrointestinal parasites of the guenons of western Uganda,"['Gillespie, TR', 'Greiner, EC', 'Chapman, CA']",JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY,10.1645/GE-311R,DEC 2004,32,"From January 1998 to December 2002, we collected 293 fecal samples from free-ranging individuals of the 4 guenon species of western Uganda, i.e., redtail guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius), blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis), l'hoesti monkeys (Cercopithecus lhoesti), and vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops), to quantify the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites. Helminth eggs, larvae, and protozoan cysts were isolated by sodium nitrate flotation and fecal sedimentation. Helminth parasites were identified, and infection prevalence was determined for all 4 guenon species. Coprocultures facilitated identification of strongylate nematodes. For the most common species, the redtail guenon, we documented prevalence of protozoan parasites and examined the effect of season and host sex on infection prevalence. Six nematodes (Strongyloides fulleborni, Oesophagostomum sp., unidentified strongyle, Trichuris sp., Streptopharagus sp., and Enterobius sp.), 1 cestode (Bertiella sp.), 1 trematode (Dicrocoeliidae), and 5 protozoans (Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba histolytica, Iodameoba butschlii, Giardia lamblia, and Chilomastix mesnili) were detected. Seasonal patterns of infection were not readily apparent for any parasite species infecting redtail guenons. Although prevalence never differed between male and female guenons, only adult females were infected with Oesophagostomum sp. and S. fulleborni."
Cataract surgery with foldable intraocular lens implants in captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['de Faber, JTHN', 'Pameijer, JH', 'Schaftenaar, W']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/03-010,DEC 2004,5,"Two juvenile, male, captive-born lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) with the same father but different mothers developed bilateral cataracts. The cataracts were surgically removed within 6 yr and 3 mo, respectively, of diagnosis, and foldable intraocular lenses were implanted. Although vision was not restored in one eye with a mature, 6-yr-old cataract in gorilla A, surgical intervention on the other eye was performed before a complete cataract developed, and vision was fully restored. Gorilla B was treated at the age of 17 mo, and normal visual development proceeded in both eyes. This animal developed bilateral after-cataract and therefore needed a second intervention in both eyes using Nd:YAG laser treatment. The genetic component of juvenile cataracts should be considered in breeding management programs."

In tropical forests, ground surveys are generally carried out by counting objects along straight lines. These counts require a strict compliance with the line-transect methodology before (proper design of the census), during (careful data collection) and after (accurate and correct data processing and analysis) the census itself. In addition, the major source of bias when estimating population size and/or trends comes from the extrapolation of estimates obtained in small sampling areas to the larger, and often incompletely known, distribution of the population. In the Kinabatangan floodplain (Sabah, Malaysia), helicopter surveys were useful in directly assessing the distribution of orang-utans and were a major advantage in the precise estimation of the size of the orang-utan population surviving in this region. Our survey showed that about 1100 orang-utans remain in the multiple-use forests of the Kinabatangan floodplain. These results provide new evidence on orang-utan adaptation to habitat disturbance and indicate the potential of the Kinabatangan multiple-use forests for orang-utan conservation. Helicopter surveys appear to be a promising alternative to ground survey for precise distribution assessment and for monitoring population trends of apes throughout their entire range in Asia and in some parts of Africa."

Serial segmental duplications during primate evolution result in complex human genome architecture,"['Stankiewicz, P', 'Shaw, CJ', 'Withers, M', 'Inoue, K', 'Lupski, JR']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.2746604,NOV 2004,79,"The human genome is particularly rich in low-copy repeats (LCRs) or segmental duplications (5%-10%), and this characteristic likely distinguishes us from lower mammals such as rodents. How and why the complex human genome architecture consisting of multiple LCRs has evolved remains an open question. Using molecular and computational analyses of human and primate genomic regions, we analyzed the structure and evolution of LCRs that resulted in complex architectural features of the human genome in proximal 17p. We found that multiple LCRs of different origins are situated adjacent to one another, whereas each LCR changed at different time points between >25 to 3-7 million years ago (Mya) during primate evolution. Evolutionary studies in primates suggested communication between the LCRs by gene conversion. The DNA transposable element MERI-Charlie3 and retroviral ERVL elements were identified at the breakpoint of the t(4;19) chromosome translocation in Gorilla gorilla, suggesting a potential role for transpositions in evolution of the primate genome. Thus, a series of consecutive segmental duplication events during primate evolution resulted in complex genome architecture in proximal 17p. Some of the more recent events led to the formation of novel genes that in human are expressed primarily in the brain. Our observations support the contention that serial segmental duplication events might have orchestrated primate evolution by the generation of novel fusion/fission genes as well as potentially by genomic inversions associated with decreased recombination rates facilitating gene divergence."

Combined serological and/or nested-PCR assays indicated SFV infection among five Gorilla gorilla gorilla, seven Mandrillus sphinx and two Mandrillus leucophaeus. Sequences of a 425 bp fragment of the integrase gene were obtained for 11 animals. Phylogenetic studies indicated that strains from gorillas, mandrills and drills each formed a highly supported phylogenetic clade with, moreover, the existence of two different gorilla SFVs. This study demonstrates for the first time that these animals are naturally infected with specific SFVs. In the context of simian-to-human interspecies transmission, the results confirm that such viruses can also infect humans, as the SFVs identified in wild-caught animals were the same as those recently reported as infecting hunters living in the same geographical areas."

There was no evidence of an antecedent gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection. Serum was negative for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody. Synovial fluid revealed 2000 white blood cells with negative cultures and polarized microscopy. Studies on synoviocytes were the following: (1) FACS analysis revealed surface expression of a B27-like epitope of the cells. (2) Analysis of intracellular clearance kinetics of arthritogenic organisms showed peak intracellular colony-forming units at 48 hours after bacterial invasion, and clearance by 13 days post-invasion. (3) Interferon-gamma (0.1-10.0 ng/ml) accelerated intracellular microbicidal pathways in a dose-dependent fashion. These findings closely parallel those seen in human synoviocytes of patients with spondyloarthropathy. Primate and human seronegative arthritis share clinical and immunologic features, as well as aspects of host:pathogen defense mechanisms. The interplay of genetic and microbial factors underlying this arthritis appears to be conserved across these species boundaries."
Characterization of primate trypanosome lytic factors,"['Lugli, EB', 'Pouliot, M', 'Portela, MDM', 'Loomis, MR', 'Raper, J']",MOLECULAR AND BIOCHEMICAL PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2004.07.004,NOV 2004,40,"Humans are one of the few species that resist infection by Trypanosoma brucei brucei because the parasites are killed by lytic factors found in human serum. Trypanosome lytic factors (TLFs) are protein/lipid complexes that contain apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), and are therefore a class of high density lipoproteins (HDLs). Haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr) is a unique protein component of TLFs, and its expression has only been demonstrated in humans. Trypanolytic activity has only been found in the sera of five primates: humans, gorillas, mandrills, baboons and sooty mangabeys. We describe here previously unidentified components of highly purified human TLF1: apolipoprotein L-I (apoL-I), human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide 18 (hCAP18) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD). However, we found that hCAP 18 and GPI-PLD, along with apoA-I, are common components of both lytic and non-lytic primate HDLs. In contrast, Hpr, which has been previously implicated as the main lytic component of TLF1, was a unique component of all trypanolytic primate HDLs. Furthermore, a polyclonal antiserum to Hpr neutralized the lytic activity from humans and baboons. ApoL-I, a candidate lytic component of human serum, was not immunologically or genetically detectable in two primate species with lytic activity. Polyclonal antiserum to apoL-I also did not neutralize TLF activity in a total human HDL preparation. These findings suggest that apoL-I is not essential in all primate TLFs, and apoL-I alone is not sufficient for optimal trypanosome lytic activity in human TLF. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We sequenced the type II-spliced region of neuropsin gene in humans and representative nonhuman primate species. Our comparative sequence analysis showed that only the hominoid species (humans and apes) have the intact open reading frame of the type II splice form, indicating that the type II neuropsin originated recently in the primate lineage about 18 MYA. Expression analysis using RT-PCR detected abundant expression of the type II form in the frontal lobe of the adult human brain, but no expression was detected in the brains of lesser apes and Old World monkeys, indicating that the type II form of neuropsin only became functional in recent time, and it might contribute to the progressive change of cognitive abilities during primate evolution."

Two species of gorillas are recognized and while the western gorillas number in the tens of thousands, only several hundred representatives of the mountain gorilla subspecies of eastern gorillas survive. To analyse the possible effects of these different population sizes, this study compares the variation observed at microsatellite and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci in samples of wild western and mountain gorillas, collected using a sampling scheme that targeted multiple social groups within defined geographical areas. Noninvasive samples proved a viable source of DNA for sequence analysis of the second exon of the DRB loci of the MHC. Observed levels of variation at the MHC locus were similar between the two gorilla species and were comparable to those in other primates. Comparison of results from analysis of variation at multiple microsatellite loci found only a slight reduction in heterozygosity for the mountain gorillas despite the relatively smaller population size."

Variations in adrenal androgen production among (nonhuman) primates,"['Conley, AJ', 'Pattison, JC', 'Bird, IM']",SEMINARS IN REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE,10.1055/s-2004-861548,NOV 2004,44,"The synthesis and secretion of the adrenal androgens dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DS) is a phenomenon apparently unique to humans and nonhuman primates. It occurs at three life stages: in utero from the fetal zone (FZ) cells of the developing adrenal cortex, during adolescence with the onset of adrenarche and the development of the zona reticularis (ZR), and in ever decreasing amounts from the ZR with aging (adrenal senescence). Insufficient data exist to know if any single nonhuman primate exactly mirrors human adrenal androgen secretion through an three life stages, and detailed morphological, biochemical, and endocrinologic studies are required to do so. Androgen synthesis requires that cells express three key enzymes, 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase cytochrome P450 (P450c17), nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR), and cytochrome b5, and that they do not express 3beta-hydroxysterold dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD). Cytochrome b5 has emerged as a particularly useful marker of androgen synthetic potential. Although a reliable index of the rate of adrenal androgen secretion, DS concentrations may not accurately reflect total adrenal androgen output because rates and routes of androgen metabolism may vary greatly among species. Based on the very limited available data, the most promising nonhuman primate models are marmosets for the human FZ, chimpanzees for human adrenarche, and macaques and baboons for mature ZR function that declines with senescence."

Apes and monkeys have been reported to be differentially susceptible to developing tau pathology. Despite this, only little is known about the organisation and sequence of Tau from nonhuman primates. Here we have sequenced Tau exons 1-13, including flanking intronic regions, and the region in intron 9 that contains Saitohin in chimpanzees.. gorillas, and gibbons. Partial sequences were obtained for cynomolgus macaque and green monkey. Chimpanzee brain tau was 100% identical to human tau. Identities were 99.5% for gorilla tau and 99.0% for gibbon tau. Chimpanzee DNA was polymorphic for a repeat in intron 9, which was present in human and gorilla tau, and for the nucleotide at position +29 of the intron that follows exon 10. As was the case of the other nonhuman primates examined, chimpanzee DNA was homozygous for nucleotides used to define the H2 haplotype in human Tau. These differences between human and chimpanzee Tau may contribute to the apparent resistance of chimpanzee brain to developing tau pathology.

Social structure and life-history patterns in western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Robbins, MM', 'Bermejo, M', 'Cipolletta, C', 'Magliocca, F', 'Parnell, RJ', 'Stokes, E']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20069,OCT 2004,73,"Life-history traits and ecological conditions have an important influence on primate social systems. Most of what we know about the life-history patterns and social structure of gorillas comes from studies of eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei sp.), which live under dramatically different ecological conditions compared to western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla sp.). In this paper we present new data on western gorilla social structure and life histories from four study sites, and make comparisons with eastern gorilla populations. Data were obtained from two study sites with gorilla groups undergoing the habituation process (Lossi, Democratic Republic of Congo; and Bai Hokou, Central African Republic) and two ""bai"" studies (Maya Nord and Mbeli Bai, Republic of Congo). The size and structure of these groups were similar to those seen in eastern gorillas. However, differences in the occurrence of various group transitions (group formations, changes between one-male and multimale composition, and group disintegrations) exist, and western gorillas notably exhibit much higher rates of male emigration and correspondingly fewer multimale groups compared to mountain gorillas. Certain phenomena have been observed only rarely, including predation by leopards. The preliminary data show no significant differences in birth rates between western gorillas and mountain gorillas. The ecological variability across gorilla habitats likely explains the flexibility in the social system of gorillas, but we need more information on the social relationships and ecology of western gorillas to elucidate the causes for the similarities and differences between western and eastern gorillas on the levels of individuals, social groups, and population dynamics.

Genetic variation in gorillas,"['Vigilant, L', 'Bradley, BJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20070,OCT 2004,11,"This review summarizes what is currently known concerning genetic variation in gorillas, on both inter- and intraspecific levels. Compared to the human species, gorillas, along with the other great apes, possess greater genetic varation as a consequence of a demographic history of rather constant population size. Data and hence conclusions from analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the usual means of describing intraspecific patterns of genetic diversity, are limited at this time. An important task for future studies is to determine the degree of confidence with which gorilla mtDNA can be analyzed, in view of the risk that one will inadvertently analyze artifactual rather than genuine sequences. The limited information available from sequences of nuclear genomic segments does not distinguish western from eastern gorillas, and, in comparison with results from the two chimpanzee species, suggests a relatively recent common ancestry for all gorillas. In the near future, the greatest insights are likely to come from studies aimed at genetic characterization of all individual members of social groups. Such studies, addressing topics such as behavior of individuals with kin and non-kin, and the actual success of male reproductive strategies, will provide a link between behavioral and genetic studies of gorillas.

Food lists were available from each site, derived from indirect signs of gorilla feeding (such as feces), with some observational data. Important staple, seasonal, and fallback foods have been identified, and a number of striking similarities across sites have been revealed based on a much larger data set than was previously available. It was confirmed that the western gorilla diet is always eclectic, including up to 230 items and 180 species. The greatest diversity is found among the fruit species eaten, fruit being included in western gorilla diets from all sites and throughout most or all of the year. Eight plant families provide important foods at five, or all six, sites, suggesting that it may be possible in the future to predict which habitats are the most suitable for gorillas. Gorillas exploit both rare and common forest species. Similarities and differences among sites can be explained superficially on the basis of geography and the past history of the forest. Gorilla density across sites appears to be most affected by the density of monocotyledonous bulk food plants, but its relationship to the density of important tree food species has yet to be tested.

"Effects of group dynamics and diet on the ranging patterns of a western gorilla group (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic","['Cipolletta, C']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20072,OCT 2004,23,"This study describes how group dynamics and diet have influenced the ranging patterns of a western gorilla group at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic. The results are compared with those from an earlier study [Cipolletta, International Journal of Primatology, 2003], when the same group was larger and undergoing the process of habituation to humans. Data were obtained from maps of the gorillas' travel routes, direct observations, and analysis of fecal samples. Through the years, the group has experienced a decrease in size, from eight to three individuals, with periods of membership fluctuation. The male's search for new mates resulted in a larger home range than was recorded when the group consisted of more individuals. Moreover, despite an average group size of three throughout this study, the monthly range and mean daily path length (DPL) were also larger when the group was acquiring/losing members in new areas, than when no new members joined or left the group. Fruit was consumed year-round, although more heavily so during wet months. The influence of fruit consumption on the ranging patterns was concealed initially by the effect of habituation [Cipolletta, International Journal of Primatology, 2003], and later (at least partially) by the male's search for new mates. In the last 14 months of the study, when the group numbered only three individuals and was ranging in a restricted area, the average DPL, but not the monthly range, increased when the gorillas were consuming more fruit.

Impact of ecological and social factors on ranging in western gorillas,"['Doran-Sheehy, DM', 'Greer, D', 'Mongo, P', 'Schwindt, D']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20075,OCT 2004,53,"We examined the influence of ecological (diet, swamp use, and rainfall) and social (intergroup interaction rate) factors on ranging behavior in one group of western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) during a 16-month study. Relative to mountain gorillas, western gorillas live in habitats with reduced herb densities, more readily available fruit (from seasonal and rare fruit trees), and, at some sites, localized large open clearings (swamps and ""bais""). Ranging behavior reflects these ecological differences. The daily path length (DPL) of western gorillas was longer (mean = 2,014 m) than that of mountain gorillas, and was largely related to fruit acquisition. Swamp use occurred frequently (27% of days) and incurred a 50% increase in DPL, and 77% of the variation in monthly frequency of swamp use was explained by ripe fruit availability within the swamp, and not by the absence of resources outside the swamp. The annual home-range size was 15.4 km(2). The western gorilla group foraged in larger areas each month, and reused them more frequently and consistently through time compared to mountain gorillas. In contrast to mountain gorillas, intergroup encounters occurred at least four times more frequently, were usually calm rather than aggressive, and had no consistent effect on DPL or monthly range size for one group of western gorillas. High genetic relatedness among at least some neighboring males [Bradley et al., Current Biology, in press] may help to explain these results, and raises intriguing questions about western gorilla social relationships.

The total home-range size of the focal group, which I calculated by superimposing a 100 m x 100 mm grid over the mapped daily path traveled, was 11 km(2). The majority (73%) of the group's home range was used exclusively, although at the periphery it overlapped with the ranges of three other groups. Most encounters (86%) with other groups (n = 14) took place in the periphery of the home range, and appeared to involve access to fruit trees. The focal group silverback's encounters with solitary silverbacks occurred throughout the focal group's home range, did not involve access to fruit, and typically resulted in aggressive or avoidance behavior. The focal group silverback's response to other group males was more varied: it included tolerance (64%), avoidance (14%), and aggression (21%), and was dependent upon the identity of the extragroup male. The focal group exhibited an unusual form of tolerant behavior toward some other groups by occasionally forming ""nesting supergroups"" (two groups nested together overnight at distances of 30-50 m). The western gorillas at Lossi were somewhat fluid in their grouping. Subgrouping and supergrouping occurred, although more infrequently than reported previously, and with a new twist: subgrouping did not necessarily require a silverback's presence. I stress the need for intraspecific comparisons and more complete data sets on western gorilla social organization. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Within-group social relationships among females and adult males in wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Stokes, EJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20074,OCT 2004,28,"Within-group female relationships, and relationships between females and adult males have not been described for wild western lowland gorillas. New data are presented here from Mbeli Bai in the Nouabale-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo. Nine groups were observed over a continuous 2-year period, and affiliative and agonistic interactions, as well as time spent by females and adult males in proximity to each other were recorded. Affiliative behavior was extremely rare in the bai, and measures of proximity between individuals were inconclusive because of the small sample sizes. Rates of agonistic interaction among females were highly variable between groups. The majority of agonistic interactions were undecided, and the supplant rate was low. Evidence for an agonistic dominance hierarchy is weak. The data do not support hypotheses that increased frugivory in western lowland gorillas raises levels of within-group contest competition; however, the need for intersite comparisons is stressed. In contrast, rates of agonistic behavior between females and silverback males were higher and more consistent between groups. Agonistic relationships between males and females conformed with patterns seen in mountain gorillas, where male protection from intraspecific aggression is important. The benefit females gain by forming long-term cooperative alliances appears to be small, and is likely outweighed by reproductive advantages associated with male protection.

Retrocyclins: Using past as prologue,"['Cole, AM', 'Wang, W', 'Waring, AJ', 'Lehrer, RI']",CURRENT PROTEIN & PEPTIDE SCIENCE,10.2174/1389203043379657,OCT 2004,30,"Retrocyclins are synthetic theta-defensins that were reconstructed from genetic blueprints that had remained unused for at least 7.5 million years. From phylogenetic studies, it appears that theta-defensins arose in Old World Monkeys, after that lineage had separated from the prosimians and New World Monkeys. Although some nonhuman primates continue to produce theta-defensin peptides today, Homo sapiens and his gorilla, bonobo, and chimpanzee relatives do not. Their inability to do so reflects the common inheritance of defective theta-defensin genes which contain a premature stop codon that aborts translation. We can only speculate if this ancient genetic event has any contemporary relevance. However, it is noteworthy that synthetic retrocyclins can prevent the entry of HIV-1 and other viruses (e.g., HSV-2) into otherwise susceptible human target cells. Our studies suggest that their antiviral properties are intimately linked to an ability to bind carbohydrate epitopes displayed by viral and cell-surface glycoproteins involved in viral entry. The ability of retrocyclins to recognize and bind carbohydrate and glycan moieties is shared by theta-defensins (RTDs) from rhesus monkeys and by several - but not all - human alpha-defensins. In addition to being the only cyclic peptides of animal origin, the lectin-like activity of theta-defensins gives them the added distinction of being the smallest sugar-binding molecules of natural origin identified to date. This unusual combination makes theta-defensins intriguing molecular prototypes that could be used to design novel carbohydrate-binding or antiviral agents."
"Inverted repeat structure of the human genome: The X-chromosome contains a preponderance of large, highly homologous inverted repeats that contain testes genes","['Warburton, PE', 'Giordano, J', 'Cheung, F', 'Gelfand, Y', 'Benson, G']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.2542904,OCT 2004,123,"We have performed the first genome-wide analysis of the Inverted Repeat (IR) structure in the human genome, using a novel and efficient software package called Inverted Repeats Finder (IRF). After masking of known repetitive elements, IRF detected 22,624 human IRs characterized by arm size from 25 bp to >100 kb with at least 75% identity, and spacer length LIP to 100 kb. This analysis required 6 h oil a desktop PC. In all, 166 IRs had arm lengths >8 kb. From this set, IRs were excluded if they were ill unfinished/unassembled regions of the genome, or Clustered with other closely related IRs, yielding a set of 96 large IRs. Of these, 24 (25%) occurred oil the X-chromosome, although it represents only similar to5% of the genome. Of the X-chromosome IRs, 83.3% were greater than or equal to99% identical, compared with 28.8% of autosomal IRs. Eleven IRs from Chromosome X, one from Chromosome 11, and seven already described from Chromosome Y contain genes predominantly expressed in testis. PCR analysis of eight of these IRs correctly amplified the corresponding region in the human genome, and six were also confirmed ill gorilla or chimpanzee genomes. Similarity dot-plots revealed that 22 IRs contained further secondary homologous structures partially categorized into three distinct patterns. The prevalence of large highly homologous IRs containing testes genes oil the X- and Y-chromosomes suggests a possible role in male germ-line gene expression and/or maintaining sequence integrity by gene conversion."
Positive selection in MAOA gene is human exclusive: determination of the putative amino acid change selected in the human lineage,"['Andres, AM', 'Soldevila, M', 'Navarro, A', 'Kidd, KK', 'Oliva, B', 'Bertranpetit, J']",HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s00439-004-1179-6,OCT 2004,26,"Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is the X-linked gene responsible for deamination and subsequent degradation of several neurotransmitters and other amines. Among other activities, the gene has been shown to play a role in locomotion, circadian rhythm, and pain sensitivity and to have a critical influence on behavior and cognition. Previous studies have reported a non-neutral evolution of the gene attributable to positive selection in the human lineage. To determine whether this selection was human-exclusive or shared with other species, we performed a population genetic analysis of the pattern of nucleotide variation in non-human species, including bonobo, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. Footprints of positive selection were absent in all analyzed species, suggesting that positive selection has been recent and unique to humans. To determine which human-unique genetic changes could have been responsible for this differential evolution, the coding region of the gene was compared between human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. Only one human exclusive non-conservative change is present in the gene: Glu151Lys. This human substitution affects protein dimerization according to a three-dimensional structural model that predicts a non-negligible functional shift. This is the only candidate position at present to have been selected to fixation in humans during an episode of positive selection. Divergence analysis among species has shown that, even under positive selection in the human lineage, the MAOA gene did not experience accelerated evolution in any of the analyzed lineages, and that tools such as K-a/K-s would not have detected the selective history of the gene."
"Orangutan nesting Behavior in disturbed forest of Sabah, Malaysia: Implications for nest census","['Ancrenaz, M', 'Calaque, R', 'Lackman-Ancrenaz, I']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/B:IJOP.0000043347.84757.9a,OCT 2004,36,"High concentrations of orangutans remain in the multiple-use forests of the Lower Kinabatangan, Sabah, Malaysia. Compared to primary forest, the habitat is highly fragmented, characterized by a low tree density ( 332 stems/ha), small tree size (83.6% of trees are < 20 m high), low basal area ( 18 m(2)/ha), abundance of canopy gaps and high level of soil disturbance. The forest structure and composition influence orangutan nesting patterns, and thus directly influence the results of nest surveys used to determine orangutan population size. In logged forests, tall and large trees are the preferred nesting sites of orangutans. The scarcity of suitable nesting sites in the logged-over forests of Kinabatangan, could partly explain the lower daily rate of nest construction ( r = 1.00) versus those of other orangutan populations. The nest decay rate t recorded at the study site ( average +/- SD = 202 +/- 151 days) strongly depends on the species of tree in which a nest is built. Our results illustrate that the nest-related parameters used for orangutan censuses fluctuate among habitat types and emphasize the need to determine specific values of r for specific orangutan populations and of t for different tree species in order to achieve accurate analysis of census data."
"Dietary variability of mountain gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda","['Ganas, J', 'Robbins, MM', 'Nkurunungi, JB', 'Kaplin, BA', 'McNeilage, A']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/B:IJOP.0000043351.20129.44,OCT 2004,47,"Data on intraspecific dietary variability has important implications for understanding flexibility in foraging behavior, habitat utilization, population dynamics, and social behavior and may also assist in conservation efforts. We compared food availability and diet of a group of mountain gorillas ( Gorilla beringei beringei) at a high altitude site and 2 groups at a low altitude site in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, from September 2001 to August 2002. Plant species diversity was greater at the low altitude site than at the high altitude site. The two groups at the low elevation consumed more plant species ( 140 species vs. 62 species), and a greater number of fruit species per mo ( 7 vs. 3 species) and per yr ( 36 vs. 11 species) than the high altitude group did. Furthermore, each group shared < 51% of important fibrous food items in their diet with the 2 other groups. There is no significant difference in the proportion of days fruit remains were found in the dung among groups. Finally, according to Ivlev's electivity index, all groups positively selected the majority of food items in their diets. We attribute a large proportion of dietary variation between locations to differences in fruit availability and plant species composition between sites. Differences between groups at the low altitude site may be due to variation in food profitability - more profitable foods available to choose in the same area - within their overlapping home range, or group traditions. A comparison of our results with the diets of gorillas of the Virunga Volcanoes in Rwanda and Kahuzi-Biega, DRC shows that eastern gorilla populations have highly variable dietary patterns with limited overlap in species consumed among groups and populations."
Ancestral population sizes and species divergence times in the primate lineage on the basis of intron and BAC end sequences,"['Satta, Y', 'Hickerson, M', 'Watanabe, H', ""O'hUigin, C"", 'Klein, J']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-004-2639-2,OCT 2004,23,"The effective sizes of ancestral populations and species divergence times of six primate species (humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and representatives of Old World monkeys and New World monkeys) are estimated by applying the two-species maximum likelihood (ML) method to intron sequences of 20 different loci. Examination of rate heterogeneity of nucleotide substitutions and intragenic recombination identifies five outrageous loci (ODC1, GHR, HBE, INS, and HBG). The estimated ancestral polymorphism ranges from 0.21 to 0.96% at major divergences in primate evolution. One exceptionally low polymorphism occurs when African and Asian apes diverged. However, taking into consideration the possible short generation times in primate ancestors, it is concluded that the ancestral population size in the primate lineage was no smaller than that of extant humans. Furthermore, under the assumption of 6 million years (myr) divergence between humans and chimpanzees, the divergence time of humans from gorillas, orangutans, Old World monkeys, and New World monkeys is estimated as 7.2, 18, 34, and 65 myr ago, respectively, which are generally older than traditional estimates. Beside the intron sequences, three other data sets of orthologous sequences are used between the human and the these data sets including 58,156 random BAC end sequences (BES) shows that the nucleotide substitution rate is as low as 0.6-0.8 x 10(-9) per site per year and the extent of ancestral polymorphism is 0.33-0.51%. With such a low substitution rate and short generation time, the relatively high extent of polymorphism suggests a fairly large effective population size in the ancestral lineage common to humans and chimpanzees."

All 75 fecal samples examined were positive for endoparasites, and each contained at least two species. Parasites present included two genera of amoebae, entodiniomorph ciliates, including Prototapirella gorillae, Troglodytella spp, and Gorillophilus thoracatus, a Balantidium-like organism, strongyle/trichostrongyle eggs (including a presumptive Mammomonouamns sp. and several other,genera), Strongyloides sp., Probstmayria sp., a spirurid, a trichuroid, and several unidentified trematodes. Flagellates and cestodes were not found. Despite the presence of a variety of parasite genera, in general, levels of parasitism were low, These data provide baseline parasitologic data for this population as part of a comprehensive health-monitoring program. With the advent of ecotourism in this study area, continued monitoring is indicated for insuring the health of both and humans in the Bai Hokou study area."

Results indicate the presence of various protozoans, Ancyclostoma sp., Ascaris sp., Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichuris trichiura, Prosthenorchis elegans and Schistosoma mansoni."
A new method for ABO genotyping using a multiplex single-base primer extension reaction and its application to forensic casework samples.,"['Doi, Yusuke', 'Yamamoto, Yuji', 'Inagaki, Sachiyo', 'Shigeta, Yoshiaki', 'Miyaishi, Satoru', 'Ishizu, Hideo']","Legal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",10.1016/j.legalmed.2004.05.005,2004-Oct,24,"We developed a new method for ABO genotyping using a multiplex single-base primer extension reaction. The method allows for the simultaneous detection of six SNP sites in the ABO gene (nt 261, 297, 681, 703, 802, and 803) and the determination of ABO genotypes from their combinations. It enabled ABO genotyping of all samples of peripheral blood DNA extracted from 103 Japanese individuals, and had a highly satisfactory detection sensitivity being capable of genotyping 0.1 ng of genomic DNA. Using this method, we were able to determine ABO genotypes of minute stain samples, heated bloodstains, aged bloodstains and mixed samples. Experiments with samples from 26 animal species and bacterial samples to test the species-specificity of the method showed that genotyping was possible in the chimpanzee and gorilla, but their genotypes were extremely rare in humans. In addition, we applied this method to casework samples, and successfully determined ABO genotypes of bones, teeth, muscles, organs, nails, and semen-contaminated vaginal fluid in which ABO grouping by conventional serological techniques was not possible. This new method enables the sensitive, simultaneous detection of six SNP sites in the ABO gene by two specific reactions, i.e. PCR and a primer extension reaction. Therefore, it holds promise as an effective method of ABO genotyping particularly for forensic samples."
Evidence of selection on the domesticated ERVWE1 env retroviral element involved in placentation,"['Bonnaud, B', 'Bouton, O', 'Oriol, G', 'Cheynet, V', 'Duret, L', 'Mallet, F']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msh206,OCT 2004,28,"The human endogenous retrovirus HERV-W multicopy family includes a unique proviral locus, termed ERVWE1, which contains gag and pol pseudogenes and has retained a full-length envelope open reading frame (ORF). This Env protein (syncytin) is a highly fusogenic membrane glycoprotein and has been proposed to be involved in hominoid placental physiology. To track the hallmarks of natural selection acting on the ERVWE1 env gene, the pattern of substitutions and indels was analyzed within all human HERV-W elements and along the ERVWE1 orthologous loci in chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon. The comparison of ERVWE1 and paralogous HERV-W copies revealed an ERVWE1-specific signature consisting of a four amino acid deletion in the intracytoplasmic tail of the glycoprotein. We show that this deletion is crucial for the envelope fusogenic activity. The comparison of the human ERVWE1 locus with its orthologs demonstrates the existence of a selective pressure to maintain the env reading frame open. Notably, the 3' part of the env gene, encoding regions required for the fusion process, is under purifying selection. The identification of selective constraints on env ERVWE1 confirms that this retroviral locus has been recruited in the hominoid lineage to become a bona fide gene."
Development of Y-chromosomal microsatellite markers for nonhuman primates,"['Erler, A', 'Stoneking, M', 'Kayser, M']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02304.x,OCT 2004,31,"We have analysed 136 newly identified human Y-chromosomal microsatellites in five (sub)species of nonhuman primates. We identified 83 male-specific loci for central chimpanzees, 82 for western chimpanzees, 67 for gorillas, 45 for orangutans and 19 loci for mandrills. Polymorphism was detected at 56 loci in central chimpanzees, 29 in western chimpanzees, 24 in western gorillas, 17 in orangutans and at three in mandrills. Success in male-specific amplification of human Y-chromosomal microsatellites in nonhuman primates was significantly negatively correlated with divergence time from the human lineage. We observed significantly more Y-chromosomal microsatellite diversity in central chimpanzees than in western chimpanzees. There were significantly more male-specific loci with longer alleles in humans than with longer alleles in the nonhuman primates; however, this significant difference disappeared when only the loci which are polymorphic in nonhuman primates were analysed, suggesting that ascertainment bias is responsible. This study provides primatologists with a large number of polymorphic, male-specific microsatellite markers that will be valuable for investigating relevant questions in behavioural ecology such as male reproductive strategies, kin-based cooperation among males and male-specific dispersal patterns in wild groups of nonhuman primates."
"Intrapopulation differences in ant eating in the mountain gorillas of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda","['Ganas, J', 'Robbins, MM']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-004-0089-5,OCT 2004,15,"Variability in ant eating has been observed in several populations of eastern and western gorillas. We investigated the occurrence of ant (Dorylus sp.) eating in two groups of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) with overlapping home ranges within Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda from September 2001 to August 2002. We calculated the frequency of ant eating by an indirect method of analyzing fecal samples from silverbacks, adult females, and juveniles. One group consumed ants significantly more often than the other (3.3 vs 17.6% of days sampled). Furthermore, the group that consumed ants more often also consumed them on a seasonal basis (September-February monthly range: 0-8%; March-August monthly range: 30-42.9%). Finally, females and juveniles of this group consumed ants significantly more often than did the silverback (total samples containing ants: silverback, 2.1%; adult female, 13.2%; juvenile, 11.2%). Differences in ant eating between groups are likely due to variability in use of habitats where ants occur (particularly secondary forests). Surveys of ant densities in differing habitats, nutritional analysis of ants, and quantification of the amount of ants in their diets are necessary to understand if ant consumption is due to availability, nutritional value, group traditions, or taste preference."
Structure of primate and rodent orthologs of the prostate cancer susceptibility gene ELAC2,"['Dumont, M', 'Frank, D', 'Moisan, AM', 'Tranchant, M', 'Soucy, P', 'Breton, R', 'Labrie, F', 'Tavtigian, SV', 'Simard, J']",BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE STRUCTURE AND EXPRESSION,10.1016/j.bbaexp.2004.07.001,SEP 17 2004,9,"The human ELAC2 gene was the first candidate prostate cancer susceptibility gene identified by linkage analysis and positional cloning. DNA sequence indicates a protein of 826 amino acids encoded by 24 exons. In the present study, we characterized the coding sequence of chimpanzee and gorilla ELAC2 orthologs by direct sequencing of genomic fragments, and of cynomolgus monkey and rat orthologs by screening cDNA libraries. The orthologs characterized in the chimpanzee, gorilla and cynomolgus monkey also encode proteins of 826 amino acids, sharing 98.9%, 98.5% and 93.7% sequence identity with the human protein. Our analyses of the mouse ELAC2 gene identified two alternative mRNA transcripts. One is translated into a protein of 824 a.a. (mouse ELAC2), whereas the other one encodes a protein of 831 amino acids (mouse ELAC2A) resulting from an alternatively spliced form of 25 exons. The rat ELAC2 gene ortholog also expressed two similar alternatively spliced transcripts. These two forms are ubiquitously expressed in mouse and rat tissues. The highest levels of expression of the ELAC2 form are observed in the testis while the lowest levels are seen in the prostate and in the muscle. However, it is of interest to note that the relative abundance of the rat and mouse ELAC2 transcripts, measured by real-time quantitative PCR, is higher than the respective ELAC2A forms in all surveyed tissues except for the prostate and the muscle. The ELAC2A transcript levels are 4.1 to 5.0-fold higher than the ELAC2 levels in the prostate of rat and mouse, respectively. A fine analysis of the conserved domains on the primary structure of ELAC2 orthologs revealed the presence of a putative p-CASP domain shared by the PSO2 (SNM1) DNA interstrand cross-link repair proteins, and the 73-kDa subunit of mRNA 3' end cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF73) as well as Artemis proteins, thus suggesting a potential interaction of ELAC2 gene product with nucleic acids and more specifically with RNA targets. Taken together, these data offer useful tools to farther study the regulation and cellular function of ELAC2 gene in experimental models and provide further insight concerning conserved amino acid motifs that could have biological significance.

Bony ponticles of the atlas (C1) over the groove for the vertebral artery in humans and primates: Polymorphism and evolutionary trends,"['Le Minor, JM', 'Trost, O']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10270,SEP 2004,18,"The aim of this study was to ascertain the distribution in primates of the three possible bony ponticles over the groove for the vertebral artery (ventral, lateral, and dorsal ponticles), in order to attempt to understand the variants observed in humans and to ascertain possible evolutionary trends in primates. The material consisted of 393 atlases of extant nonhuman primates representative of 41 genera, and of 500 human atlases (dried bones of adults). For each atlas, we studied the existence and morphology of the ponticles, and the type of association of these three ponticles on a given side, which are theoretically of eight in number (types A-H). The occurrence of these ponticles varied from complete absence to constant presence, according to the genera and taxa of primates. The presence of each of these ponticles in primates can be interpreted as a primitive or plesiomorphic character, and their absence as a derived or apomorphic character. The strepsirhines-platyrrhines-cercopithecines group, presenting a predominant primitive pattern (type A), appeared to be separated from the colobines-hominoids group, presenting predominant derived patterns (type C in colobines, Pongo pygmaeus, and Pan troglodytes, and the more derived type D in Hylobates, Gorilla gorilla, and Homo sapiens). The last derived stage, corresponding to the disappearance of the three atlantal ponticles (type H), was only observed in some individuals in hominoids. A marked intraspecific polymorphism characterized the hominoids. The presence of lateral and dorsal ponticles in humans appeared to correspond to their persistence within the progressive disappearance of the atlantal ponticles, constituting an evolutionary tendency characteristic of primates and particularly of hominoid evolution.

The method employs standard refractive light microscopy instead of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and all use-wear features are counted or scored under low magnification (35X). We use measurement systems analysis (variance components analysis of sources of measurement error) to evaluate the consistency and reproducibility of measurements using this method. The method is shown to have low intra- and inter-observer measurement error, and to effectively distinguish among graminivores, folivores, and frugivores. It can also be used to identify seed predators and to diagnose hard-object feeding. The method is also shown to be robust to the selection of measurement site; it works equally well when applied to upper or to lower molars. Finally, we use analysis of variance to examine the consistency of the signals across mammalian orders, and discriminant function analysis to develop dietary diagnostic tools for a set of ""classified"" primates with known diets. We test the success of these tools not merely by examining their a posteriori classification ""success,"" but by using them to construct predicted dietary profiles for a sample of unclassified extant primate species, again with known diets.

Comparative genetics of functional trinucleotide tandem repeats in humans and apes,"['Andres, AM', 'Soldevila, M', 'Lao, O', 'Volpini, V', 'Saitou, N', 'Jacobs, HT', 'Hayasaka, I', 'Calafell, F', 'Bertranpetit, J']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-004-2628-5,SEP 2004,16,"Several human neurodegenerative disorders are caused by the expansion of polymorphic trinucleotide repeat regions. Many of these loci are functional short tandem repeats (STRs) located in brain-expressed genes, and their study is thus relevant from both a medical and an evolutionary point of view. The aims of our study are to infer the comparative pattern of variation and evolution of this set of loci in order to show species-specific features in this group of STRs and on their potential for expansion (therefore, an insight into evolutionary medicine) and to unravel whether any human-specific feature may be identified in brain-expressed genes involved in human disease. We analyzed the variability of the normal range of seven expanding STR CAG/CTG loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3-MJD, SCA6, SCA8, SCA12, and DRPLA) and two nonexpanding polymorphic CAG loci (KCNN3 and NCOA3) in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The study showed a general conservation of the repetitive tract and of the polymorphism in the four species and high heterogeneity among loci distributions. Humans present slightly larger alleles than the rest of species but a more relevant difference appears in variability levels: Humans are the species with the largest variance, although only for the expanding loci, suggesting a relationship between variability levels and expansion potential. The sequence analysis shows high levels of sequence conservation among species, a lack of correspondence between interruption patterns and variability levels, and signs of conservative selective pressure for some of the STR loci. Only two loci (SCA1 and SCA8) show a human specific distribution, with larger alleles than the rest of species. This could account, at the same time, for a human-specific trait and a predisposition to disease through expansion."
Ecological recovery of an afromontane forest in south-western Uganda,"['Lejju, JB']",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-2028.2004.00463.x,AUG 2004,4,"A study of the regeneration of an afromontane forest was carried out in Mgahinga Gorilla National Park (MGNP), south-western Uganda. The area landscape has been subjected to agricultural encroachment for the last 50 years. The landscape was changed by terracing and removing the indigenous vegetation and replacing it with exotic tree species. Stratified random sampling was employed in sampling the vegetation. There was a significant difference in species richness and density in the three habitat types. The natural forest supported the highest stem density (75%) and the lowest stem density (4%) was recorded under exotic woodlots. Seedlings (<2 cm, diameter at breast height) accounted for the majority of juveniles in the three habitats. The natural forest had the highest density (24,625 seedlings ha(-1)) and exotic woodlots supported the lowest stem density (1350 seedlings ha-1). The level of regeneration in the encroachment area is influenced by the intensity of cultivation and soil nutrients. The advanced growth beneath the exotic woodlots, especially black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) and Eucalyptus sp. stands is relatively impoverished. This condition beneath the exotic species suggests that a low diverse community of native species is able to exploit this environment."
Functional anatomy of the olecranon process in hominoids and plio-Pleistocene hominins,"['Drapeau, MSM', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10359,AUG 2004,23,"This study examines the functional morphology of the olecranon process in hominoids and fossil hominins. The length of the bony lever of the triceps brachii muscle (TBM) is measured as the distance between the trochlear articular center and the most distant insertion site of the TBM, and olecranon orientation is measured as the angle that this bony lever makes with the long axis of the ulna. Results show that Homo, Pan, Gorilla, most monkeys, and the Australopithecus fossils studied have similar relative olecranon lengths. Suspensory hominoids and Ateles have shorter olecranons, suggesting, in some instances, selection for greater speed in extension. The orientation that the lever arm of the TBM makes with the long axis of the ulna varies with preferred locomotor mode. Terrestrial primates have olecranons that are more posteriorly oriented as body size increases, fitting general models of terrestrial mammalian posture. Arboreal quadrupeds have more proximally oriented lever arms than any terrestrial quadrupeds, which suggests use of the TBM with the elbow in a more flexed position. Olecranon orientation is not consistent in suspensory hominoids, although they are all characterized by orientations that are either similar or more posterior than those observed in quadrupeds. Homo and the fossils have olecranons that are clearly more proximally oriented than expected for a quadruped of their size. This suggests that Homo and Australopithecus used their TBM in a flexed position, a position most consistent with manipulatory activities. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Testicular histological examination of spermatogenetic activity in captive gorillas (Gorilla gorilla),"['Enomoto, T', 'Matsubayashi, K', 'Nakano, M', 'Fujii-Hanamoto, H', 'Kusunoki, H']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20051,AUG 2004,3,"To clarify the reproductive state of male gorillas, we performed histological examinations on the testicles of 10 male gorillas (Gorilla gorilla). The testicular samples were obtained by autopsy, and ordinal histological preparations were made for light microscopy. The poor spermatogenesis of this species was characterized by the following findings: First, spermatogenesis was evident in only four samples. Meiosis progressed in two samples, but they lacked spermatogenesis. In the remaining four specimens, seminiferous tubules hyalinized without any sign of spermatogenesis. Second, seminiferous epithelia were thin even in the males in which spermatogenesis was observed. Third, degenerated seminiferous tubules were found in all specimens. Fourth, abnormally large syncytial cells were found in the tubules. Six stages in the epithelial cycle of the seminiferous tubules were identified. Testosterone staining made it clear that there were many Leydig cells with spherical or fusiform nuclei in an abundance of interstitial tissue. The relevance of the testicular architecture of gorillas to the mating system is discussed. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Simulation of the population dynamics and social structure of the Virunga mountain gorillas,"['Robbins, MM', 'Robbins, AM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20052,AUG 2004,24,"An agent-based model was developed to simulate the growth rate, age structure, and social system of the endangered mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in the Virunga Volcanoes region. The model was used to compare two types of data: 1) estimates of the overall population size, age structure, and social structure, as measured by six censuses of the entire region that were conducted in 1971-2000; and 2) information about birth rates, mortality rates, dispersal patterns, and other life history events, as measured from three to five habituated research groups since 1967. On the basis of the research-group data, the ""base simulation"" predicted a higher growth rate than that observed from the census data (3% vs. 1%). This was as expected, because the research groups have indeed grown faster than the overall population. Additional simulations suggested that the research groups primarily have a lower mortality rate, rather than higher birth rates, compared to the overall population. Predictions from the base simulation generally fell within the range of census values for the average group size, the percentage of multimale groups, and the distribution of females among groups. However, other discrepancies predicted from the research-group data were a higher percentage of adult males than observed, an overestimation of the number of multimale groups with more than two silverbacks, and an overestimated number of groups with only two or three members. Possible causes for such discrepancies include inaccuracies in the census techniques used, and/or limitations with the long-term demographic data set obtained from only a few research groups of along-lived species. In particular, estimates of mortality and male dispersal obtained from the research groups may not be representative of the entire population. Our final simulation addressed these discrepancies, and provided a better basis for further studies on the complex relationships among individual life history events, group composition, population age structure, and growth rate patterns.

Molar enamel thickness and distribution patterns in extant great apes and humans: new insights based on a 3-dimensional whole crown perspective,"['Kono, RT']",ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE,10.1537/ase.03106,AUG 2004,84,"Molar enamel thickness is a key feature in the study of hominid evolution. Our understanding of enamel thickness and distribution patterns, however, has so far been based mostly on the limited information available from physical cross sections of the crown. In this study, the 3-dimensional (3D) whole crown enamel distribution pattern was explored in 74 extant great ape and modem human molars. Serial cross sections obtained from microfocal X-ray computed tomography were used to generate digital molar reconstructions at 50 to 80 micron voxel resolution, each crown represented by two to five million voxels. Surface data of both enamel dentine junction (EDJ) and outer enamel were extracted to derive volumetric measures, surface areas, curvilinear distances, and whole crown radial thickness maps. Three-dimensional average enamel thickness (AET) was defined as enamel volume divided by EDJ surface area. In 3D AET relative to tooth size, Homo exhibited the thickest, Gorilla the thinnest, and Pan and Pongo intermediately thick enamel. This result differs from previous claims that molar enamel of Pongo is relatively thicker than that of Pan. The discrepancy between three and two-dimensional (2D) values of AET stems from a combination of local differences in within tooth enamel distribution pattern and EDJ topography between Pan and Pongo molars. It demonstrates that 2D AET is not an appropriate substitute or estimator of whole crown AET. Examination of whole crown 3D distributions of molar enamel revealed a pattern common to all four examined species, the ""functional"" side of the molar having thicker enamel than the opposite side. However, some unique aspects of each species were also apparent. While the Gorilla molar has relatively thin enamel throughout its crown, Pan molars are characterized by particularly thin enamel in the occlusal fovea, and Pongo molars by an accentuation of relatively thin basal and thick occlusal enamel. Human molars are characterized by relatively thick enamel throughout the crown, with relatively large contrasts between buccal and lingual, and between mesial and distal crown portions. The ancestral condition common to the four extant species can be estimated by interpreting molar enamel distribution patterns unique to each genus as likely to be derived. We hypothesize that the last common ancestor likely had intermediately thick enamel, without particular thickening (or thinning) of enamel either occlusally or basally."

"Digesta passage, digestibility and behavior in captive gorillas under two dietary regimens","['Remis, MJ', 'Dierenfeld, ES']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/B:IJOP.0000029124.04610.c7,AUG 2004,33,"Gorilla adaptation has been debated in recent years given the wide variation among diets of gorillas in different habitats. Gorillas are the largest of living primates, have large colons and should be capable of processing tough foods. Preliminary captive studies have suggested that they may well have long average gut retention times relative to smaller hominoids, which should facilitate digestive efficiency in their wild counterparts. Indeed, wild gorillas consume large amounts of fibrous foods as staples or fall-back foods across their range, in response to habitat-related or seasonal changes in fruit availability. Fluctuations in diet might be matched by changes in digesta passage and digestibility, with possible selective retention of harder to digest items. We further studied digestive processes via chemical cobalt and chromium markers to track liquid and solids, as they passed through the guts of gorillas at the San Francisco Zoo (SFZ). In addition, we examined the effects of variation in captive diets on intake, digesta passage, digestion and behavior. The SFZ gorillas exhibited high digestibility coefficients, and gut passage was long relative to those of smaller-bodied hominoids. The results permit us to understand more fully the relationships of digestive processes to adaptation and dietary flexibility in the wild and to inform the development of dietary recommendations to improve the well-being of captive gorillas."
"Population and group structure of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Lokoue, Republic of Congo","['Gatti, S', 'Levrero, F', 'Menard, N', 'Gautier-Hion, A']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20045,JUL 2004,38,"During a 17-month study at the Lokoue clearing in Odzala National Park, Republic of Congo, we identified 377 western lowland gorillas. This population included 31 solitary males, 37 breeding groups, and eight nonbreeding groups. Its age- and sex-class structure was similar to those observed at two other clearings in the same forest block. However, the size of breeding groups varied with site (either clearing or forest sites). At Lokoue, breeding groups (mean size: 8.2 gorillas; range: 3-15) included a single silverback male and, on average, 3.2 adult females. Nonbreeding groups (mean size: 5.5; range: 2-15) were devoid of adult females. Five of the nonbreeding groups were composed predominantly of blackbacks, subadult males, and juveniles, and thus fit the definition of all-male groups previously observed in mountain gorillas. Our study confirms that 1) one-male breeding groups are the norm in western gorillas, and 2) all-male groups occur in this species. Despite frequent changes in members due to migrations of the males, the persistence of these all-male groups indicates that they may play an important role in the life of migrating males. Variations in population structure, and group composition and type among gorilla populations are discussed. However, a further understanding of the evolution of group-living in gorillas requires detailed ecological studies conducted in parallel with studies of the population structure and dynamics of these groups.

Here we demonstrate that several previously reported D-loop haplotypes from West African gorillas are in all likelihood nuclear integrations of mitochondrial DNA. Revised estimates of the amount and pattern of mitochondrial DNA diversity in gorillas are provided, revealing two reciprocally monophyletic and highly divergent groups of gorillas, concurrent with their geographic distribution.

Magnetic resonance (MR) images of three mountain gorilla brains were obtained with a 3T scanner, and the volume of major neuroanatomical structures (neocortical gray matter, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum) was measured. These data were included with our existing database that includes 23 chimpanzees, three western lowland gorillas, and six orang-utans. We defined a multidimensional space by calculating the principal components (PCs) from the correlation matrix of brain structure fractions in the well-represented sample of chimpanzees. We then plotted data from all of the taxa in this space to examine phyletic variation in neural organization. Most of the variance in mountain gorillas, as well as other great apes, was contained within the chimpanzee range along the first two PCs, which accounted for 61.73% of the total variance. Thus, the majority of interspecific variation in brain structure observed among these ape taxa was no greater than the within-species variation seen in chimpanzees. The loadings on PCs indicated that the brain structure of great apes differs among taxa mostly in the relative sizes of the striatum, cerebellum, and hippocampus. These findings suggest possible functional differences among taxa in terms of neural adaptations for ecological and locomotor capacities. Importantly, these results fill a critical gap in current knowledge regarding great ape neuroanatomical diversity. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Between-group encounters among bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata),"['Cooper, MA', 'Aureli, F', 'Singh, M']",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,10.1007/s00265-004-0779-4,JUL 2004,29,"Socioecological theory suggests that between-group competition is an important factor affecting the nature of primate social relationships. Between-group encounters in macaques may involve female resource defense, male mate defense, and male resource defense. We observed between-group encounters in two groups (a forest group and a temple group) of bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata). We observed 102 encounters in 875 h of observation of the forest group (1.40 per 12-h day) and 58 encounters in 907 h of observation of the temple group (0.77 per 12-h day). Aggressive interactions between groups occurred in 32.4% and 29.3% of encounters in the forest and temple groups, respectively. Overall, we found little support for the female resource defense hypothesis. Females in both groups rarely participated aggressively in between-group encounters. We found support for the male mate defense hypothesis. For example, males of the forest group were more aggressive during encounters in the mating season than in the non-mating season. Males were also aggressive to females from their own group immediately following encounters. We also found partial support for the male resource defense hypothesis. Encounters in the forest group occurred in a feeding context more often than expected based on time budgets. Also, males in the temple group were more often aggressive in food-related encounters than in other encounters. The findings of this study suggest that socioecological models of primate social relationships need to distinguish male and female strategies during between-group encounters and integrate the resulting functional outcomes."

The fauna comprises vertebrates that are aquatic (fish, turtles, crocodiles) and amphibious (anthracotheriids, hippopotamids) but also species adapted to the gallery and islet forests (monkeys), wooded savanna (proboscideans, giraffids, suids, etc) and grassland (bovids, tridactyl equids). Sedimentological data (aeolian sandstones, perilacustrine sandstones, diatomites) agree with this mosaic of environments and indicate a vegetated perilacustrine belt between lake and desert. The new hominid is probably temporally close to the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans but displays a unique combination of primitive and derived characters that clearly shows a close relationship with later hominids rather than with chimpanzees or gorilla. The geographic location of Toumai, 2500 km west of the Rift Valley, along with its great antiquity, suggest an early widespread hominid distribution (Sahel and East Africa, at least by 6 Ma), and a somewhat earlier chimpanzee-human divergence (at least by 7 Ma ago) than previously indicated by many molecular studies.

It is therefore likely that the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans was also Pan-like, and lived in Late Miocene Africa. But it is possible that most if not all Miocene apes are unrelated to crown hominoids.

Support for the latter hypothesis includes biogeographical patterns inferred from the fossil record and proposed Miocene hominoid phylogenetic relationships. The absence of fossil apes from the African Late Miocene has been used as evidence that crown hominoids were not present in Africa during this period. An alternative explanation for the paucity of these hominoids is that biases in collection and preservation have affected the African Miocene fossil record. A survey of currently known African Later Miocene sites and their faunas shows that these sites generally do not contain hominoids because of small sample sizes, poor preservation, or inappropriate habitat sampling. These preservation biases have important implications for evaluating the origins of the Homininae. (C) 2004 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved."
Functional structure of the skull in hominoidea,"['Preuschoft, H', 'Witzel, U']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000078936,2004,16,"Finite elements stress analysis (FESA) was used to investigate the flow of compressive forces which occur if a homogenous, three-dimensional body representing the skull is loaded by simulated bite forces against the tooth row. Model 1 represents the snout alone. Bite forces are applied simultaneously, but increase rearward. Stresses in the model concentrate along the anterior contour and the lower surface of the model, leaving unstressed a nasal opening and a wide naso-oral connection. Model 2 represents the facial region, as far as the temporomandibular joint. The orbits and the nasal cavity are assumed to be present a priori. Model 3 applies reactions to the bite forces in the temporal fossa, corresponding to the origins of the masticatory muscles. Regions of the model under compressive stress correspond closely to the arrangement of bony material in a hominoid skull. If only the stress-bearing finite elements on each section are combined, and the stress-free parts neglected, the resulting three-dimensional shape is surprisingly similar to a hominoid skull. If bite forces are applied to parts of the tooth row only, the stress patterns are lower, asymmetrical and do not spread into all regions that are stress-bearing in simultaneous biting on all teeth. In model 2, the highest stresses occur at the tooth roots and along the forehead on top of the nasal roof. There are no marked stress concentrations on top of the orbits. The resulting shape resembles that of an orang-utan. In model 3, the highest stresses also occur at the tooth roots, but the circles of force mostly close below the brain case, so that the stress concentration in the forehead region remains much less marked. In this model, however, the stress concentrations are very similar to hollow brow ridges. The entire resulting shape resembles that of gorilla or chimpanzee skulls. A typical gracile australopithecine skull (STS-5) also shows clear similarities to the patterns of stress flow in our models. Compared to our earlier study of the modern human skull, differences relate to: the relative length and width of the dental arcade, the relative size of the brain case and the position of the arcade relative to the brain case. It seems that these traits are the points of attack of selective pressures, while all other morphological details are simply consequences of stress flow. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel."
"Degeneration of an ATP-binding cassette transporter gene, ABCC13, in different mammalian lineages","['Annilo, T', 'Dean, M']",GENOMICS,10.1016/j.ygeno.2004.02.010,JUL 2004,25,"The ABC transporter gene family has evolved by a gene ""birth-and-death"" process; however, the number of ABC pseudogenes in the human genome is surprisingly small. On chromosome 21q11.2, spanning 90 kb, is an ABC gene-like sequence (recently annotated as ABCC13) with the highest similarity to ABCC2. Here we show that while comparative analysis and in silico prediction methods indicate the presence of at least 28 exons, the majorABCC13 transcript in humans consists of only 6 exons with a total length of 1.1 kb. The open reading frame of this transcript is capable of encoding a polypeptide of only 274 amino acids, compared to the more than 1500 amino acids of related ABC transporters. The truncated ABCC13 transcript shows tissue-specific expression, highest in fetal liver, bone marrow, and colon. Since the last exon of the ABCC13 transcript contains an apparent frameshift, we sequenced the respective region from several primates and found that the frameshift is due to an 11-bp deletion that is shared between human, chimpanzee, and gorilla, but is not found in monkeys. In addition, the human ABCC13 gene contains two other frameshift indels in the exons that encode the second nucleotide-binding domain, indicating that ABCC13 is not capable of encoding a functional ABC protein. In an attempt to identify an intact ABCC13 ortholog, we have sequenced the full-length cDNA from rhesus macaque, which contains an open reading frame of 1296 amino acids, producing an apparently functional ABC transporter. Although the mouse and rat genomes contain long-range similarity in the locus where Abcc13 is expected to reside, most of the Abcc13 exons in rodents are degraded below the threshold of sequence homology searches or have been deleted completely.

"Ontogenetic allometry, heterochrony, and interspecific differences in the skull of African apes, using tridimensional Procrustes analysis","['Berge, C', 'Penin, X']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10333,JUN 2004,41,"Ontogenetic studies of African ape skulls lead to an analysis of morphological differences in terms of allometry, heterochrony, and sexual dimorphism. The use of geometric morphometrics allows us 1) to define size and shape variations as independent factors (an essential but seldom respected condition for heterochrony), and 2) to calculate in percentage of shape changes and to graphically represent the parts of shape variation which are related to various biological phenomena: common allometry, intraspecific allometry, and allometric and nonallometric shape discrimination. Three tridimensional Procrustes analyses and the calculation of multivariate allometries, discriminant functions, and statistical tests are used to compare the skulls of 50 Pan troglodytes, and 50 Gorilla gorilla of different dental stages. The results both complement and modify classical results obtained from similar material but with different methods (Shea [1983] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 62:275-289; Shea [1983] Folia Primatol. (Basel) 40:32-68; Shea [1985] Size and Scaling in Primate Morphology, New York: Plenum, p. 175-205). As previously described by Shea, the common growth allometric pattern is very important (64% of total shape variation). It corresponds to a larger increase of facial volume than of neurocranial volume, a more obliquely oriented foramen magnum, and a noticeable reshaping of the nuchal region (higher inion). However, the heterochronic interpretation based on common allometry is rather different from Shea. Gorillas differ from chimpanzees not only with a larger magnitude of allometric change (rate peramorphosis), as is classically said, but also grow more in size than in shape (size acceleration). In other words, for a similar stage of growth, gorillas have the size and shape corresponding to older chimpanzees, and for a similar shape, gorillas have a larger size than chimpanzees. In contrast, sexual dimorphism actually corresponds to allometric changes only, as classically demonstrated (time hypermorphosis). Sexual dimorphism is here significant in adult gorillas alone, and solely in terms of allometry (size-related shape and size, given that sagittal and nuchal crests are not taken into account). The study also permits us to differentiate two different shape variations that are classically confused in ontogenetic studies: a very small part of allometric shape change which is specific to each species (1% of the total shape variation), and nonallometric species-specific traits independent of growth (8% of total shape change). When calculated in terms of intraspecific allometries (including common allometry and noncommon allometry), shape changes are more extensive in gorillas (36% of total shape change) than in chimpanzees (29% of total shape change). The allometric differences mainly concern the inion, which becomes higher; the position of the foramen magnum, more dorsally oriented; and the palate, more tilted in adult gorillas than in adult chimpanzees. In contrast, nonallometric species-specific traits in gorillas are the long and flat vault characterized by a prominent occipital region, the higher and displaced backward glabella, and the protrusive nose. Biomechanical schemes built from shape partition suggest that the increased out-of-plumb position of the head during growth is partially compensated in gorillas by a powerful nuchal musculature due to the peculiar shape of the occipital region.

"Geometric morphometric analysis of allometric variation in the mandibular morphology of the hominids of Atapuerca, Sima de los Huesos site","['Rosas, A', 'Bastir, M']",ANATOMICAL RECORD PART A-DISCOVERIES IN MOLECULAR CELLULAR AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.a.20049,JUN 2004,39,"Allometry is an important factor of morphological integration that contributes to the organization of the phenotype and its variation. Variation in the allometric shape of the mandible is particularly important in hominid evolution because the mandible carries important taxonomic traits. Some of these traits are known to covary with size, particularly the retromolar space, symphyseal curvature, and position of the mental foramen. The mandible is a well studied system in the context of the evolutionary development of complex morphological structures because it is composed of different developmental units that are integrated within a single bone. In the present study, we investigated the allometric variation of two important developmental units that are separated by the inferior nerve (a branch of CN V3). We tested the null hypothesis that there would be no difference in allometric variation between the two components. Procrustes-based geometric morphometrics of 20 two-dimensional (2D) landmarks were analyzed by multivariate regressions of shape on size in samples from 121 humans, 48 chimpanzees, and 50 gorillas (all recent specimens), eight fossil hominids from Atapuerca, Sima de los Huesos (AT-SH), and 17 Neandertals. The findings show that in all of the examined species, there was significantly greater allometric variation in the supra-nerve unit than in the infra-nerve unit. The formation of the retromolar space exhibited an allometric relationship with the supra-nerve unit in all of the species studied. The formation of the chin-like morphology is an ""apodynamic"" feature of the infra-nerve unit in the AT-SH hominids. The results of this study support the hypothesis that allometry contributes to the organization of variation in complex morphological structures. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Pongo pygmaeus (orangutan), Gorilla gorilla (gorilla) and Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee) brain samples showed the typical ""palisade"" of interlaminar processes. Yet, those from Pan troglodytes were less uniform, showing extended cortical segments with astrocytic (""syncytial-type"") appearance, intermingled with segments expressing the interlaminar ""palisade"". Present observations contribute to fill in missing data on the phylogenetic emergence of the cerebral cortex astroglial interlaminar processes. Considering the extreme consistency of the expression of astroglial interlaminar ""palisades"" among anthropoid species, this apparent variability among Pan individuals could be due to various possibilities, which are considered in this report."
Population genetic and phylogenetic evidence for positive selection on regulatory mutations at the Factor VII locus in humans,"['Hahn, MW', 'Rockman, MV', 'Soranzo, N', 'Goldstein, DB', 'Wray, GA']",GENETICS,10.1534/genetics.103.025726,JUN 2004,43,"The abundance of cis-regulatory polymorphisms in humans Suggests that many may have been important in human evolution, but evidence for their role is relatively rare. Four common polymorphisms in the 5' promoter region of factor VII (F7), a coagulation factor, bave been shown to affect its transcription and protein abundance both in vitro and in vivo. Three of these polymorphisms have low-frequency alleles that decrease expression of F7 and may provide protection against myocardial infarction (heart attacks). The fourth polymorphism has a minor allele that increases the level of transcription. To look for evidence of natural selection on the cis-regulatory variants flanking F7, we genotyped three of the polymorphisins in six Old World populations for which we also have data front a group of putatively neutral SNPs. Our population genetic analysis shows evidence for selection within humans; surprisingly, the strongest evidence is clue to a large increase in frequency of the high-expression variant in Singaporean Chinese. Further characterization of a japanese population shows that at least part of the increase in frequency of the high-expression allele is found in other East Asian populations. In addition, to examine interspecific patterns of selection we sequenced the homologous 5' noncoding region in chimpanzees, bonobos, a gorilla, an orangutan, and a baboon. Analysis of these data reveals an excess of fixed differences within transcription factor binding sites along the human lineage. Our results thus further support the hypothesis that regulatory mutations have been important in human evolution."

We find a twofold increase in Alu insertions in humans in comparison to the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The genomic diversity (polymorphism for presence or absence of the Alu insertion) associated with these inserts indicates that, analogous to recent nucleotide diversity studies, the level of chimpanzee Alu diversity is -1.7 times higher than that of humans. Evolutionarily recent Alu subfamily structure differs markedly between the human and chimpanzee lineages, with the major human subfamilies remaining largely inactive in the chimpanzee lineage. We propose a population-based model to account for the observed fluctuation in Alu retroposition rates across primate taxa."
Identification of two pseudogenes with sequence homology to human and gorilla MHC class IA genes: Ancestral haplotype in the Filipino population,"['Coquillard, G', 'Lau, M', 'Kletzel, M', 'Rodriguez-Marino, SG']",HUMAN IMMUNOLOGY,10.1016/j.humimm.2004.02.025,JUN 2004,5,"While characterizing exons 2 and 3 of the class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A locus in human lymphocytes, two similar but unexpected PCR products were detected in six samples of Filipino ethnicity. A nucleotide sequence analysis of the two amplicons, tentatively named HLA-COQ and HLA-DEL, rendered them as two novel and seemingly related sequences, both with homology to the gorilla and human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) A locus. Exon 2 is similar to the published human pseudogenes HLA-BEL, HLA-Y, and to primate MHC Gogo-A*0501, differing by 2 bp from HLA-BEL, and HLA-Y, and by 4 bp from Gogo-A*0501. Exon 3 is most similar to HLA-A*2902 and A*310102, differing by 7 bp from A*2902, and by 8 bp from A*31012. Genomic sequence comparison of exons I to 8 indicates that their closest published match is to the Gogo-A*0501. Complete typing at the HLA-A, -B, -C, DRB1, and DRB5 loci for the six samples yielded the reoccurring types: HLA-A*3401, -B*1521/1525, -Cw*0403, -DRB1*150201, and DR135*010101. Thus far, HLA-COQ and HLA-DEL have been detected only in Filipino samples containing these HLA types. The HLA-COQ gene is nonfunctional based on a stop codon located in exon 4. HLA-DEL is also a nonfunctional gene because of the dual cytosine insertion in exon 4, with a reading frame shift generating a stop codon downstream. Parsimony analysis of the two pseudogenes with 31 other primate A locus coding regions resulted in a phylogenetic tree that segregated the two pseudogenes with the Gogo-A*0501, suggesting that HLA-COQ, HLA-DEL, and Gogo-A*0501 evolved from a common ancestral allele.

Visual information consisted of letting subjects look inside the cups. Auditory information consisted of shaking the cup so that the baited cup produced a rattling sound. Subjects correctly selected the baited cup both when they saw or heard the food. Nine individuals were above chance in both visual and auditory conditions. More important, subjects as a group selected the baited cup when only the empty cup was either shown or shaken, which means that subjects chose correctly without having seen or heard the food (i.e., inference by exclusion). Control tests showed that subjects were not more attracted to noisy cups, avoided shaken noiseless cups, or learned to use auditory information as a cue during the study. It is concluded that subjects understood that the food caused the noise, not simply that the noise was associated with the food."
Comparison of cranial ontogenetic trajectories among great apes and humans,"['Mitteroecker, P', 'Gunz, P', 'Bernhard, M', 'Schaefer, K', 'Bookstein, FL']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.03.006,JUN 2004,193,"Molecular data suggest that humans are more closely related to chimpanzees than either is to the gorillas, yet one finds the closest similarity in craniofacial morphology to be among the great apes to the exclusion of humans. To clarify how and when these differences arise in ontogeny, we studied ontogenetic trajectories for Homo sapiens, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus. A total of 96 traditional three-dimensional landmarks and semilandmarks on the face and cranial base were collected on 268 adult and sub-adult crania for a geometric morphometric analysis. The ontogenetic trajectories are compared by various techniques, including a new method, relative warps in size-shape space. We find that adult Homo sapiens specimens are clearly separated from the great apes in shape space and size-shape space. Around birth, Homo sapiens infants are already markedly different from the great apes, which overlap at this age but diverge among themselves postnatally. The results suggest that the small genetic differences between Homo and Pan affect early human ontogeny to induce the distinct adult human craniofacial morphology. Pure heterochrony does not sufficiently explain the human craniofacial morphology nor the differences among the African apes. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"The deciduous lower dentition of Ouranopithecus macedoniensis (Primates, Hominoidea) from the late Miocene deposits of Macedonia, Greece","['Koufos, GD', 'de Bonis, L']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.03.007,JUN 2004,11,"Two mandibular fragments with associated milk teeth assigned to the late Miocene hominoid primate Ouranopithecus macedoniensis are analyzed. The fossils, which belong to a single individual, were found in the Vallesian locality of ""Ravin de la Pluie"" of the Axios Valley (Macedonia, Greece). The material is described here and compared with extant and extinct hominoids, allowing assessment of the evolutionary trends in the deciduous lower dentition within the Hominoidea. Hylobatids represent the more primitive pattern. Gorilla is slightly more derived than hylobatids, but less derived than Pongo and Pan, the latter being the most derived. With relatively smaller deciduous canines and more molarized deciduous premolars, Ouranopithecus is more derived than both Pan and Gorilla. Among the fossil hominoids, Proconsul, representing the primitive condition, has a very simple dp(3) and a dp(4) that has a trigonid that is taller than the talonid and which lacks a hypoconulid. Griphopithecus is more derived than Proconsul in having a dp(4) with a lower trigonid, a hypoconulid, and a less oblique cristid obliqua. Australopithecus and Paranthropus possess a similar morphology to that of Homo, while Ardipithecus appears to be more primitive than the latter genera. Ouranopithecus has a more derived lower milk dentition than Proconsul and Griphopithecus, but less derived than Australopithecus and Paranthropus. The comparison of the lower milk dentition of Ouranopithecus confirms our previous conclusions suggesting that this fossil hominoid shares derived characters with Australopithecus and Homo.

Clinical effects and plasma concentrations of fentanyl after transmucosal administration in three species of great ape,"['Hunter, RP', 'Isaza, R', 'Carpenter, JW', 'Koch, DE']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/03-008,JUN 2004,8,"Fentanyl is approved for transmucosal use in the United States as a preanesthetic agent in human pediatric patients and in adults for breakthrough cancer pain. Using this formulation in three species of great ape, including eight orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), nine chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and two gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), fentanyl was offered transmucosally at an intended dose of 10-15 mug/kg based on estimated body weight. The animals were trained to accept and suck slowly on a piece of placebo candy, given as a treat, after an overnight fast. On the day of the study, the animals were given the lollipop formulation of fentanyl. The resulting plasma concentrations of fentanyl supported transmucosal absorption, similar to that reported in humans. This study provides an alternative sedative regimen and yielded half-life data of transmucosal fentanyl in great apes. Although transmucosal fentanyl was a useful adjunct for sedating orangutans and gorillas, its acceptance by chimpanzees before chemical immobilization was suboptimal and unpredictable."

DNA was amplified from shed hair collected from sites across the range of the three traditionally recognized gorilla subspecies: western lowland (G. g. gorilla), eastern lowland (G. g. graueri) and mountain (G. g. beringei) gorillas. Nucleotide sequence variation was examined in the first hypervariable domain of the mitochondrial control region and was much higher in western lowland gorillas than in either of the other two subspecies. In addition to recapitulating the major evolutionary split between eastern and western lowland gorillas, phylogenetic analysis indicates a phylogeographical division within western lowland gorillas, one haplogroup comprising gorilla populations from eastern Nigeria through to southeast Cameroon and a second comprising all other western lowland gorillas. Within this second haplogroup, haplotypes appear to be partitioned geographically into three subgroups: (i) Equatorial Guinea, (ii) Central African Republic, and (iii) Gabon and adjacent Congo. There is also evidence of limited haplotype admixture in northeastern Gabon and southeast Cameroon. The phylogeographical patterns are broadly consistent with those predicted by current Pleistocene refuge hypotheses for the region and suggest that historical events have played an important role in shaping the population structure of this subspecies."

"The influence of a camouflage net barrier on the behaviour, welfare and public perceptions of zoo-housed gorillas","['Blaney, EC', 'Wells, DL']",ANIMAL WELFARE,NA,MAY 2004,21,"Visitors to zoos can be a potential source of stress to captive-housed primates, resulting in increased abnormal behaviour and intra-group aggression. Finding a way to screen primates from human visitors may be one method of decreasing stress and enhancing animal welfare. For this study, the behaviour of six zoo-housed gorillas was studied for one month during standard housing conditions (control condition) and for a further month following the installation of a camouflage net barrier to the viewing area of the exhibit (barrier condition). Visitors' (n = 200) perceptions of the animals and the exhibit were also recorded during each condition. The net barrier had a significant effect on some components of the gorillas' behaviour. The gorillas exhibited significantly lower levels of conspecific-directed aggression and stereotypic behaviours during the barrier than the control condition. The net barrier also had a slight effect on visitors' perceptions both of the animals and of their exhibit The gorillas were considered to took more exciting and less aggressive during the barrier than the control condition. The exhibit was also considered to be more appropriate for visitors following the introduction of the camouflage netting. Overall, the addition of a screen such as camouflage netting could be considered a positive change, resulting in a reduction in those behaviours typically induced by large groups of visitors and an improvement in public perceptions of the animals and their environment."
Inter-group encounters and male incursions in Colobus vellerosus in central Ghana,"['Sicotte, P', 'Macintosh, AJ']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/1568539041166717,MAY 2004,38,"Inter-group encounters can I - reflect between-group contest competition for access to limiting, defensible resources, 2 - allow individuals to gather information on the surrounding groups to assess mating or dispersal opportunities or to assess resistance to a possible transfer or takeover, 3 - allow individuals to convey information to the other group about one's quality/status. We present data on inter-group encounters and male incursions (where one or several mates encounter a reproductive unit) in Colobus vellerosus at the Boabeng Fiema Monkey Sanctuary in Ghana to assess whether they are compatible with these three functions, and in the case of the limiting resource defense hypothesis, to assess the resource competed for. Our study group was observed for 343 hours over 61 days between June and November 2001, and interacted with three neighboring groups in 47 encounters. Inter-group encounters were more frequent than male incursions (34 vs 13) and lasted longer (median: 45 vs 9 minutes). Most encounters included aggression towards individuals in the opposing group (39/47). Males were aggressors as well as targets of male aggression in a majority of encounters. Females were targets of male aggression in over half of encounters, while being aggressive in only a few of them. We describe three cases of male aggression towards immatures during male incursions, and one case of female transfer following one of these male incursions. Two extra-group mating attempts were observed during inter-group encounters. Most encounters took place in quadrats that were important food patch (>5% of feeding time), although the two quadrats that had the hi best proportion of feeding did not hold any encounters. Inter-group encounters were more likely to occur in the feeding context than male incursions. The intensity of male aggression was not influenced by whether the encounter took place in the feeding context or not. Our data suggest that direct and indirect male mate defense is the most likely motivation for encounters under the limiting resource defense hypothesis. Female resource defense may occasionally occur in C. vellerosus, but does not explain the majority of encounters. Encounters in general, but in particular nonaggressive encounters and male incursions are probably a mean by which individuals can assess individuals of neighboring groups for mating, transfer or takeover possibilities, as well as convey information about their own status or quality."
Dynamics of a human interparalog gene conversion hotspot,"['Bosch, E', 'Hurles, ME', 'Navarro, A', 'Jobling, MA']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.2177404,MAY 2004,52,"Gene conversion between paralogs can alter their patterns of sequence identity, thus obscuring their evolutionary relationships and affecting their propensity to sponsor genomic rearrangements. The details of this important process are poorly understood in the human genome because allelic diversity complicates the interpretation of interparalog sequence differences. Here we exploit the haploid nature of the Y chromosome, which obviates complicating interallelic processes, together with its known phylogeny, to understand the dynamics of conversion between two directly repeated HERVs flanking the 780-kb AZFa region on Yq. Sequence analysis of a 787-bp segment of each of the HERVs in 36 Y chromosomes revealed one of the highest nucleotide diversities in the human genome, as well as evidence of a complex patchwork of highly directional gene conversion events. The rate of proximal-to-distal conversion events was estimated as 2.4 x 10(-4) to 1.2 x 10(-3) per generation (3.9 x 10(-7) to 1.9 X 10(-6) per base per generation), and the distal-to-proximal rate as about one-twentieth of this. Minimum observed conversion tract lengths ranged from 1 to 158 bp and maximum lengths from 19 to 1365 bp, with an estimated mean of 31 bp. Analysis of great ape homologs shows that conversion in this hotspot has a deep evolutionary history."
Testing the chromosomal speciation hypothesis for humans and chimpanzees,"['Zhang, JZ', 'Wang, XX', 'Podlaha, O']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.1891104,MAY 2004,38,"Fixed differences of chromosomal rearrangements between isolated Populations may promote speciation by preventing between-population gene flow upon secondary contact, either because hybrids suffer from lowered fitness or, more likely, because recombination is reduced in rearranged chromosomal regions. This chromosomal speciation hypothesis thus predicts more rapid genetic divergence on rearranged than on colinear chromosomes because the former are less porous to gene flow. A number of studies Of fungi, plants, and animals, including limited genetic data of humans and chimpanzees, support the hypothesis. Here we reexamine the hypothesis for humans and chimpanzees with substantially more genomic data than were used previously. No difference is observed between rearranged and colinear chromosomes in the level of genomic DNA sequence divergence between species. The same is also true for protein Sequences. When the gorilla is used as an outgroup, no acceleration in protein sequence evolution associated with chromosomal rearrangements is found. Furthermore, divergence in expression pattern between orthologous genes is not significantly different for rearranged and colinear chromosomes. These results, showing that chromosomal rearrangements did not affect the rate of genetic divergence between humans and chimpanzees, are expected if incipient species on the evolutionary lineages separating humans and chimpanzees did not hybridize."

Here we examine the env sequence in primates for evidence of evolutionary conservation. ERV3 sequences were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of great ape and Old World primates but not from New World primates or gorilla, suggesting an integration event more than 30 million years ago with a subsequent loss in one species. In the chimpanzee, the protein sequence of Env is 98.18% identical to that of human. In other species the identity falls (93.71% in rhesus macaque) in proportion to the separation from the human lineage. Start and stop codons and domains of functional significance in the envelope protein are conserved. The evolutionary conservation of the ERV3 envelope suggests a beneficial function, though the loss from gorilla shows that it is not essential for survival or reproduction. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

"Fossils, feet and the evolution of human bipedal locomotion","['Harcourt-Smith, WEH', 'Aiello, LC', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.0021-8782.2004.00296.x,MAY 2004,96,"We review the evolution of human bipedal locomotion with a particular emphasis on the evolution of the foot. We begin in the early twentieth century and focus particularly on hypotheses of an ape-like ancestor for humans and human bipedal locomotion put forward by a succession of Gregory, Keith, Morton and Schultz. We give consideration to Morton's (1935) synthesis of foot evolution, in which he argues that the foot of the common ancestor of modern humans and the African apes would be intermediate between the foot of Pan and Hylobates whereas the foot of a hypothetical early hominin would be intermediate between that of a gorilla and a modern human. From this base rooted in comparative anatomy of living primates we trace changing ideas about the evolution of human bipedalism as increasing amounts of postcranial fossil material were discovered. Attention is given to the work of John Napier and John Robinson who were pioneers in the interpretation of Plio-Pleistocene hominin skeletons in the 1960s. This is the period when the wealth of evidence from the southern African australopithecine sites was beginning to be appreciated and Olduvai Gorge was revealing its first evidence for Homo habilis. In more recent years, the discovery of the Laetoli footprint trail, the AL 288-1 (A. afarensis) skeleton, the wealth of postcranial material from Koobi Fora, the Nariokotome Homo ergaster skeleton, Little Foot (Stw 573) from Sterkfontein in South Africa, and more recently tantalizing material assigned to the new and very early taxa Orrorin tugenensis, Ardipithecus ramidus and Sahelanthropus tchadensis has fuelled debate and speculation. The varying interpretations based on this material, together with changing theoretical insights and analytical approaches, is discussed and assessed in the context of new three-dimensional morphometric analyses of australopithecine and Homo foot bones, suggesting that there may have been greater diversity in human bipedalism in the earlier phases of our evolutionary history than previously suspected."
Dental topography and diets of Australopithecus afarensis and early Homo,"['Ungar, P']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.03.004,MAY 2004,106,"Diet is key to understanding the paleoecology of early hominins. We know little about the diets of these fossil taxa, however, in part because of a limited fossil record, and in part because of limitations in methods available to infer their feeding adaptations. This paper applies a new method, dental topographic analysis, to the inference of diet from fossil hominin teeth. This approach uses laser scanning to generate digital 3D models of teeth and geographic information systems software to measure surface attributes, such as slope and occlusal relief. Because it does not rely on specific landmarks that change with wear, dental topographic analysis allows measurement and comparison of variably worn teeth, greatly increasing sample sizes compared with techniques that require unworn teeth. This study involved comparison of occlusal slope and relief of the lower second molars of Australopithecus afarensis (n=15) and early Homo (n=8) with those of Gorilla gorilla gorilla (n=47) and Pan troglodytes troglodytes (n=54). Results indicate that while all groups show reduced slope and relief in progressively more worn specimens, there are consistent differences at given wear stages among the taxa. Early Homo shows steeper slopes and more relief than chimpanzees, whereas A. afarensis shows less slope and relief than any of the other groups. The differences between the two hominin taxa are on the same order as those between the extant apes, suggesting similar degrees of difference in diet. Because these chimpanzees and gorillas differ mostly in fallback foods where they are sympatric, results suggest that the early hominins may likewise have differed mostly in fallback foods, with A. afarensis emphasizing harder, more brittle foods, and early Homo relying on tougher, more elastic foods.

To assess human exposure to STLVs in western Central Africa, we screened for STLV infection in primates hunted in the rain forests of Cameroon. Blood was obtained from 524 animals representing 18 different species. All the animals were wild caught between 1999 and 2002; 328 animals were sampled as bush meat and 196 were pets. Overall, 59 (11.2%) of the primates had antibodies cross-reacting with HTLV-1 and/or HTLV-2 antigens; HTLV-1 infection was confirmed in 37 animals, HTLV-2 infection was confirmed in 9, dual HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infection was confirmed in 10, and results for 3 animals were indeterminate. Prevalences of infection were significantly lower in pets than in bush meat, 1.5 versus 17.0%, respectively. Discriminatory PCRs identified STLV-1, STLV-3, and STLV-1 and STLV-3 in HTLV-1-, HTLV-2-, and HTLV-1- and HTLV-2-cross-reactive samples, respectively. We identified for the first time STLV-1 sequences in mustached monkeys (Cercopithecus cephus), talapoins (Miopithecus ogouensis), and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and confirmed STLV-1 infection in mandrills, African green monkeys, agile mangabeys, and crested mona and greater spot-nosed monkeys. STLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and env sequences revealed that the strains belonged to different PTLV-1 subtypes. A high prevalence of PTLV infection was observed among agile mangabeys (Cercocebus agilis); 89% of bush meat was infected with STLV. Cocirculation of STLV-1 and STLV-3 and STLV-1-STLV-3 coinfections were identified among the agile mangabeys. Phylogenetic analyses of partial LTR sequences indicated that the agile mangabey STLV-3 strains were more related to the STLV-3 CTO604 strain isolated from a red-capped mangabey (Cercocebus torquatus) from Cameroon than to the STLV-3 PH969 strain from an Eritrean baboon or the PPA-F3 strain from a baboon in Senegal. Our study documents for the first time that (i) a substantial proportion of wild-living monkeys in Cameroon is STLV infected, (ii) STLV-1 and STLV-3 cocirculate in the same primate species, (iii) coinfection with STLV-1 and STLV-3 occurs in agile mangabeys, and (iv) humans are exposed to different STLV-1 and STLV-3 subtypes through handling primates as bush meat."
Human-specific amino acid changes found in 103 protein-coding genes,"['Kitano, T', 'Liu, YH', 'Ueda, S', 'Saitou, N']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msh100,MAY 2004,21,"humans have many characteristics that are different from those of the great apes. These human-specific characters must have arisen through mutations accumulated in the genome of our direct ancestor after the divergence of the last common ancestor with chimpanzee. Gene trees of human and great apes are necessary for extracting these human-specific genetic changes. We conducted a systematic analysis of 103 protein-coding genes for human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. Nucleotide sequences for 18 genes were newly determined for this study, and those for the remaining genes were retrieved from the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database. The total number of amino acid changes in the human lineage was 147 for 26,199 codons (0.56%). The total number of amino acid changes in the human genome was, thus, estimated to be about 80,000. We applied the acceleration index test and Fisher's synonymous/nonsynonymous exact test for each gene tree to detect any human-specific enhancement of amino acid changes compared with ape branches. Six and two genes were shown to have significantly higher nonsynonymous changes at the human lineage from the acceleration index and exact tests, respectively. We also compared the distribution of the differences of the nonsynonymous substitutions on the human lineage and those on the great ape lineage. Two genes were more conserved in the ape lineage, whereas one gene was more conserved in the human lineage. These results suggest that a small proportion of protein-coding genes started to evolve differently in the human lineage after it diverged from the ape lineage."
Accelerated evolution of the ASPM gene controlling brain size begins prior to human brain expansion,"['Kouprina, N', 'Pavlicek, A', 'Mochida, GH', 'Solomon, G', 'Gersch, W', 'Yoon, YH', 'Collura, R', 'Ruvolo, M', 'Barrett, JC', 'Woods, CG', 'Walsh, CA', 'Jurka, J', 'Larionov, V']",PLOS BIOLOGY,10.1371/journal.pbio.0020126,MAY 2004,102,"Primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global reduction in cerebral cortical volume. The microcephalic brain has a volume comparable to that of early hominids, raising the possibility that some MCPH genes may have been evolutionary targets in the expansion of the cerebral cortex in mammals and especially primates. Mutations in ASPM, which encodes the human homologue of a fly protein essential for spindle function, are the most common known cause of MCPH. Here we have isolated large genomic clones containing the complete ASPM gene, including promoter regions and introns, from chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and rhesus macaque by transformation-associated recombination cloning in yeast. We have sequenced these clones and show that whereas much of the sequence of ASPM is substantially conserved among primates, specific segments are subject to high Ka/Ks ratios (nonsynonymous/synonymous DNA changes) consistent with strong positive selection for evolutionary change. The ASPM gene sequence shows accelerated evolution in the African hominoid clade, and this precedes hominid brain expansion by several million years. Gorilla and human lineages show particularly accelerated evolution in the IQ domain of ASPM. Moreover, ASPM regions under positive selection in primates are also the most highly diverged regions between primates and nonprimate mammals. We report the first direct application of TAR cloning technology to the study of human evolution. Our data suggest that evolutionary selection of specific segments of the ASPM sequence strongly relates to differences in cerebral cortical size."
Hepatic alveolar echinococcosis in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis),"['Bacciarini, LN', 'Gottstein, B', 'Pagan, O', 'Rehmann, P', 'Grone, A']",VETERINARY PATHOLOGY,10.1354/vp.41-3-229,MAY 2004,24,"Alveolar echinococcosis was diagnosed in 12 cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) at postmortem examination within a period of 6 years. Besides consistent involvement of the liver, parasitic lesions were also present in mesenteric lymph nodes, pancreas, lung, and kidney. In the liver, various patterns of host's responses to parasitic tissue could be distinguished. Infiltration of macrophages, often multinucleated, around usually intact metacestodes was the main feature of one pattern. A second pattern was characterized by the presence of abundant, normally degenerate granulocytes in addition to macrophages surrounding collapsed laminated structures. Finally and as a third pattern, some cysts were surrounded by marked collagen deposition, which was usually not a significant feature of the other foci. Parasitic cysts with protoscolices were observed in foci with the first and third pattern but not in the second one. The simultaneous occurrence of all three patterns was observed in most animals. Type AA amyloid was identified either in the space of Disse, macrophages or blood vessel walls in nine animals using immunohistochemistry. Identity of parasitic structures such as metacestodes of Echinococcus multilocularis was confirmed immunohistochernically. All animals that could be tested serologically (7/12) had detectable antibodies against the E. multilocularis-specific Em2 antigen. Liver lesions of six animals were additionally analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, yielding the amplification of a specific E. multilocularis DNA fragment in each case."
Reactions of capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) to multiple mirrors,"['Paukner, A', 'Anderson, JR', 'Fujita, K']",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,10.1016/j.beproc.2003.11.001,APR 30 2004,12,"This study attempted a new manipulation to prompt mirror self-recognition in a monkey species through simultaneous exposure to two mirrors. Four capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) were exposed to one large and one small mirror object with different reflective or configurational properties, which was thought to deepen their understanding of mirrors. The monkeys predominantly engaged in looking behaviours towards the large mirror, which decreased over sessions. There was also an increase in looking behaviours towards the small mirror object when it reflected an undistorted image compared to the control condition. No instances of self-directed responses, oblique looks or manipulations of both mirror objects in combination were observed. The results confirm and expand on previous reports of failure to find evidence of mirror self-recognition in monkeys. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Fracture toughness of mountain gorilla (Gorilla gorilla beringei) food plants,"['Elgart-Berry, A']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20021,APR 2004,31,"Mountain gorillas, the largest extant primates, subsist almost entirely on plant matter. Moreover, their diet includes a substantial amount of structural material, such as bark and stems, which other primates tend to avoid. Accordingly, the robust masticatory apparatus of gorillas may be adaptive to this presumably tough diet; however, quantitative information on this subject is lacking. In this study the fracture toughness of mountain gorilla foods was examined for the first time. Samples of 44 food plants from Bwindi-Impenetrable National Park (BINP) and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park (MGNP) were tested. These parks are inhabited by two gorilla populations that regarded by some as being distinct at the subspecific taxonomic level. Although food toughness did not differ between the two populations, both diets contained tough items. Tree barks were the toughest food items (varying from 0.23 to 8.2 kJ/m(2)), followed by shrub barks, pith, and stems. The toughness of leaves and fruit was negligible compared to that of bark. The toughness of bamboo was low in comparison to the toughest food items. Accordingly, the prominent toughness of bark, pith, and stems may be key factors in the evolution of orofacial robusticity in mountain gorillas. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Long-term retention of the differential values of Arabic numerals by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Beran, MJ']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-003-0191-x,APR 2004,13,"As previously reported (Beran and Rumbaugh, 2001), two chimpanzees used a joystick to collect dots, one-at-a-time, on a computer monitor, and then ended a trial when the number of dots collected was equal to the Arabic numeral presented for the trial. Here, the chimpanzees were presented with the task again after an interval of 6 months and then again after an additional interval of 3.25 years. During each interval, the chimpanzees were not presented with the task, and this allowed an assessment of the extent to which both animals retained the values of each Arabic numeral. Despite lower performance at each retention interval compared to the original study, both chimpanzees performed above chance levels in collecting a quantity of dots equal to the target numeral, one chimpanzee for the numerals 1-7, and the second chimpanzee for the numerals 1-6. For the 3.25-year retention, errors were more dispersed around each target numeral than in the original study, but the chimpanzees' performances again appeared to be based on a continuous representation of magnitude rather than a discrete representation of number. These data provide an experimental demonstration of long-term retention of the differential values of Arabic numerals by chimpanzees."
Event memory and misinformation effects in a gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Schwartz, BL', 'Meissner, CA', 'Hoffman, M', 'Evans, S', 'Frazier, LD']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-003-0194-7,APR 2004,14,"Event memory and misinformation effects were examined in an adult male gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). The gorilla witnessed a series of unique events, involving a familiar person engaging in a novel behavior (experiment 1), a novel person engaging in a novel behavior (experiment 2), or the presentation of a novel object (experiment 3). Following a 5- to 10-min retention interval, a tester gave the gorilla three photographs mounted on wooden cards: a photograph depicting the correct person or object and two distractor photographs drawn from the same class. The gorilla responded by returning a photograph. If correct, he was reinforced with food. Across three experiments, the gorilla performed significantly above chance at recognizing the target photograph. In experiment 4, the gorilla showed at-chance performance when the event was followed by misinformation (a class-consistent, but incorrect photograph), but significantly above-chance performance when no misinformation occurred (either correct photograph or no photograph). Although the familiarity can account for these data, they are also consistent with an episodic-memory interpretation."
A uniquely human consequence of domain-specific functional adaptation in a sialic acid-binding receptor,"['Sonnenburg, JL', 'Altheide, TK', 'Varki, A']",GLYCOBIOLOGY,10.1093/glycob/cwh039,APR 2004,35,"Most mammalian cell surfaces display two major sialic acids (Sias), N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Humans lack Neu5Gc due to a mutation in CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase, which occurred after evolutionary divergence from great apes. We describe an apparent consequence of human Neu5Gc loss: domain-specific functional adaptation of Siglec-9, a member of the family of sialic acid-binding receptors of innate immune cells designated the CD33-related Siglecs (CD33rSiglecs). Binding studies on recombinant human Siglec-9 show recognition of both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc. In striking contrast, chimpanzee and gorilla Siglec-9 strongly prefer binding Neu5Gc. Simultaneous probing of multiple endogenous CD33rSiglecs on circulating blood cells of human, chimp, or gorilla suggests that the binding differences observed for Siglec-9 are representative of multiple CD33rSiglecs. We conclude that Neu5Ac-binding ability of at least some human CD33rSiglecs is a derived state selected for following loss of Neu5Gc in the hominid lineage. These data also indicate that endogenous Sias (rather than surface Sias of bacterial pathogens) are the functional ligands of CD33rSiglecs and suggest that the endogenous Sia landscape is the major factor directing evolution of CD33rSiglec binding specificity. Exon-1-encoded Sia-recognizing domains of human and ape Siglec-9 share only similar to93-95% amino acid identity. In contrast, the immediately adjacent intron and exon 2 have the similar to98-100% identity typically observed among these species. Together, our findings suggest ongoing adaptive evolution specific to the Sia-binding domain, possibly of an episodic nature. Such domain-specific divergences should also be considered in upcoming comparisons of human and chimpanzee genomes."
"Densities, distributions, and seasonal movements of gorillas and chimpanzees in swamp forest in northern Congo","['Poulsen, JR', 'Clark, CJ']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/B:IJOP.0000019153.50161.58,APR 2004,27,"The conservation of gorillas ( Gorilla spp.) and chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes) depends upon knowledge of their densities and distribution throughout their ranges. However, information about ape populations in swamp forests is scarce. Here we build on current knowledge of ape populations by conducting line transect surveys of nests throughout a reserve dominated by swamp forest: the Lac Tele Community Reserve in northern Congo. We estimated gorilla and chimpanzee densities, distributions across habitats, and seasonal changes in abundance. Gorilla density was 2.9 gorillas km(-2), but densities varied by habitat (0.3 - 5.4 gorillas km(-2)) with highest densities in swamp forest and terra firma mixed forest. Average chimpanzee density is 0.7 chimpanzees km(-2) (0.1 - 1.3 chimpanzees km(-2)), with highest densities in swamp forest. Habitat was the best predictor of ape nest abundance, as neither the number of human indices nor the distance from the nearest village predicted nest abundance. We recorded significantly greater numbers of apes in terra firma forest during the high-water season than the low-water season, indicating that many gorillas and chimpanzees are at times concentrated in terra firma forest amid a matrix of swamp forest. Seasonally high numbers of apes on terra firma forest islands easily accessible to local people may expose them to substantial hunting pressure. Conversely, the nearly impenetrable nature of swamp forests and their low value for logging makes them promising sites for the conservation of apes."

Relatively few studies, however, provide such information. We present the results of a survey of the densities of two great ape species, the gorilla Gorilla gorilla gorilla and chimpanzee Pan troglodytes troglodytes, in a non-protected area on the northern periphery of Dja Faunal Reserve, Cameroon. Densities of chimpanzees and gorillas were estimated to be 1.1 and 3.8 weaned individuals per km(2), respectively. The results confirm that gorillas prefer building nests in vegetation types with limited visibility, and that within preferred vegetation types for nesting, gorillas select patches that are the most difficult to penetrate, resulting in less conspicuous nests. Although the opposite tendencies were exhibited by chimpanzees, no firm conclusions could be drawn from our data. Despite its non-protected status and past and ongoing logging activities in the area, the densities of gorillas and chimpanzees on the northern periphery of Dja Faunal Reserve are comparable to those found within the reserve itself, indicating the need for developing alternative conservation action to protect these important populations. The creation of a Communal Wildlife Zone in this area is legislatively possible, and could be an effective conservation tool. because it has to originate from the local people."
What can comparative studies of placental structure tell us? A review,"['Enders, AC', 'Carter, AM']",PLACENTA,10.1016/j.placenta.2004.01.011,APR 2004,67,"The diversity of placental structures in Eutherian mammals is such that drawing generalizations from the definitive forms is problematic. There are always areas of reduced interhaemal distance whether the placenta is epitheliochorial, synepitheliochorial, endotheliochorial or haemochorial. However, the thinning may be achieved by different means. The presence of a haemophagous area as an iron transport facilitator is generally associated with endotheliochorial placentae but is also found in sheep and goats (synepithellochorial) and in tenrecs and hyaenas (haemochorial). Although similar chorioallantoic placentae are found within families, structure begins to diverge at the ordinal level and there is little correlation at the supraordinal level of phylogeny. Differences in formation and function of the yolk sac provide additional variation. There would appear to be considerable adaptive pressure for development or retention of the haemochorial. type of chorioallantoic placenta. This type of placenta has several possible drawbacks including more ready passage of fetal cells to the maternal organism and, should the haemochorial condition be achieved early, oxidative stress. At any rate no animal larger than the human and gorilla has this type of placenta. The endothellochorial condition is found in animals as large as the bears, manatee and elephants. In addition to the ungulates, the epitheliochorial condition is present in the largest animals with the longest gestation periods, the whales. Considering the length of time since the early stages of mammalian evolution, it is probable that few unmodified structural features are present in any currently surviving mammal. Nevertheless, more complete studies of divergent types of mammalian placenta should help our understanding of mammalian interrelationships as well as placental function.

Comparisons made with other Miocene and living apes (Proconsul, Equatorius, Ugandapithecus) suggest that the mobility of the scapulohumeral joint was important, and scapular features such as the morphology and position of the spine and the morphology of the acromion and axillary border resemble those of climbing arboreal primates except for chimpanzees, gorillas, or orang-utans. From the size of the scapula (male Nasalis size), it is clear that the animal is smaller than an adult chimpanzee, but the clavicle is almost as relatively long as those of chimpanzees. Some features closer to colobine morphology reinforce the hypothesis that Nacholapithecus was probably a good climber and was definitely adapted for an arboreal life."
On the possible adaptive value of coprophagy in free-ranging chimpanzees,"['Krief, S', 'Jamart, A', 'Hladik, CM']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-003-0074-4,APR 2004,13,"Coprophagy occurred during major periods of feeding on fruits of Dialium spp. (Caesalpiniaceae) in a group of orphaned chimpanzees released in Conkouati Douli National Park, Republic of Congo. Since stress, boredom or food scarcity could not explain coprophagy according to our daily behavioral and veterinary control observations, we suggest that Dialium seeds were the item of interest in the feces. Two types of Dialium seeds were commonly found in the feces after chimpanzees swallowed the mesocarp and whole seeds together. These seeds were either whole and hard or whole/broken and soft imbibed. A mechanical and/or chemical effect of the gut passage may enable the chimpanzees to chew and ingest the seeds, thus providing nutritional intake."

Here we address these problems by using morphometric data. Three-dimensional landmark data from the hominoid temporal bone effectively quantify the shape of a complex element of the skull. Phylogenetic analysis using distance-based methods corroborates the molecular consensus on African ape and human phylogeny strongly supporting a Pan-Homo clade. Phenetic differentiation of great ape subspecies is pronounced, as suggested previously by mitochondrial DNA and some morphological studies. These results show that the hominoid temporal bone contains a strong phylogenetic signal and reveal the potential for geometric morphometric analysis to shed light on phylogenetic relationships."

In contrast, masticatory muscles are considerably smaller in both modern and fossil members of Homo. The evolving hominid masticatory apparatus - traceable to a Late Miocene, chimpanzee-like morphology(3) - shifted towards a pattern of gracilization nearly simultaneously with accelerated encephalization in early Homo(4). Here, we show that the gene encoding the predominant myosin heavy chain (MYH) expressed in these muscles was inactivated by a frameshifting mutation after the lineages leading to humans and chimpanzees diverged. Loss of this protein isoform is associated with marked size reductions in individual muscle fibres and entire masticatory muscles. Using the coding sequence for the myosin rod domains as a molecular clock, we estimate that this mutation appeared approximately 2.4 million years ago, predating the appearance of modern human body size(5) and emigration of Homo from Africa(6). This represents the first proteomic distinction between humans and chimpanzees that can be correlated with a traceable anatomic imprint in the fossil record."
Dispersed male networks in western gorillas,"['Bradley, BJ', 'Doran-Sheehy, DM', 'Lukas, D', 'Boesch, C', 'Vigilant, L']",CURRENT BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cub.2004.02.062,MAR 23 2004,85,"Although kin-selection theory has been widely used to explain the tendency of individuals to bias beneficial behaviors towards relatives living within the same social group [1], less attention has focused on kin-biased interactions between groups. For animal societies in which females emigrate, as is the case for mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), encounters between males in different groups often involve aggressive displays that can escalate to physical violence and fatal injuries [2, 3]. However, recent findings on the little-studied western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) indicate that interactions between social groups occur more frequently than they do in mountain gorillas and are often [4, 5], although not always [5, 6], surprisingly nonaggressive. We investigated the pattern of genetic relationships between individuals of different groups and found evidence suggesting a previously unrecognized ""dispersed male network"" social structure in western gorillas in which the single males leading social groups were usually related to one or more nearby males. We propose that this provides a basis for extra-group, kin-biased behaviors and may explain the reported peaceful intergroup interactions. Furthermore, these results suggest that a patrilocal social structure, in which males remain in their natal region and potentially benefit from kin associations, is a feature unifying African apes and humans."

Although SIV and other primate retroviruses infect laboratory workers and zoo workers, zoonotic retrovirus transmission has not been documented in natural settings. We investigated zoonotic infection in individuals living in central Africa.

Methods We obtained behavioural data, plasma samples, and peripheral blood lymphocytes from individuals living in rural villages in Cameroon. We did serological testing, PCR, and sequence analysis to obtain evidence of retrovirus infection.

Findings Zoonotic infections with simian foamy virus (SFV), a retrovirus endemic in most Old World primates, were identified in people living in central African forests who reported direct contact with blood and body fluids of wild non-human primates. Ten (1%) of 1099 individuals had antibodies to SFV. Sequence analysis from these individuals revealed three geographically-independent human SFV infections, each of which was acquired from a distinct non-human primate lineage: De Brazza's guenon (Cercopithecus neglectus), mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx), and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), two of which (De Brazza's guenon and mandrill) are naturally infected with SIV.

Interpretation Our findings show that retroviruses are actively crossing into human populations, and demonstrate that people in central Africa are currently infected with SFV. Contact with non-human primates, such as happens during hunting and butchering, can play a part in the emergence of human retroviruses and the reduction of primate bushmeat hunting has the potential to decrease the frequency of. disease emergence."

Single nucleotide polymorphisms within the 5' flanking region (-597G>A, -572G>C and -174G>C) have previously been associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease and influencing transcription of IL-6 both in vitro and in vivo. In addition to these, a polymorphic AnTn tract is also present in the promoter of IL-6. Analysis in five different primate species demonstrated a G allele at -597, -572 and -174 in all species. By contrast, the AnTn tract was polymorphic in at least three species, and was roughly conserved in overall length despite an increase in the relative proportion of A versus T in the evolution of the human sequence from that in the ancestor of the great apes. The effect of the AnTn polymorphism on IL-6 levels was examined following coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), a known inflammatory stimulus for IL-6 production. One hundred and thirty-two patients undergoing CABG were genotyped for the AnTn tract by automated sequencing. Four alleles were identified: A8T12 (allele frequency 0.35, 95% CI 0.29-0.40); A9T11 (0.26, 0.21-0.31); A10T11 (0.21, 0.16-0.26); and A10T10 (0.18, 0.14-0.23). Isolation of the effect of different alleles of the AnTn tract on an identical haplotypic background for the other polymorphisms in the promoter showed that individuals homozygous for A9T11 had significantly higher post-operative IL-6 levels than A10T11 homozygotes (275 +/- 46 pg/ml versus 152 +/- 29; P = 0.04). The effect of the A8T12 allele could not be determined separately due to strong allelic association with -174C. The conserved length of the AnTn tract and the association in vivo with IL-6 levels strongly suggest the functionality of the tract on IL-6 expression, independent of contributions from other polymorphic sites within the promoter.

Sister grouping of chimpanzees and humans as revealed by genome-wide phylogenetic analysis of brain gene expression profiles,"['Uddin, M', 'Wildman, DE', 'Liu, GZ', 'Xu, WB', 'Johnson, RM', 'Hof, PR', 'Kapatos, G', 'Grossman, LI', 'Goodman, M']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0308725100,MAR 2 2004,138,"Gene expression profiles from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and macaque samples provide clues about genetic regulatory changes in human and other catarrhine primate brains. The ACC, a cerebral neocortical region, has human-specific histological features. Physiologically, an individual's ACC displays increased activity during that individual's performance of cognitive tasks. Of approximate to45,000 probe sets on microarray chips representing transcripts of all or most human genes, approximate to16,000 were commonly detected in human ACC samples and comparable numbers, 14,00015,000, in gorilla and chimpanzee ACC samples. Phylogenetic results obtained from gene expression profiles contradict the traditional expectation that the non-human African apes (i.e., chimpanzee and gorilla) should be more like each other than either should be like humans. Instead, the chimpanzee ACC profiles are more like the human than like the gorilla; these profiles demonstrate that chimpanzees are the sister group of humans. Moreover, for those unambiguous expression changes mapping to important biological processes and molecular functions that statistically are significantly represented in the data, the chimpanzee clade shows at least as much apparent regulatory evolution as does the human clade. Among important changes in the ancestry of both humans and chimpanzees, but to a greater extent in humans, are the up-regulated expression profiles of aerobic energy metabolism genes and neuronal function-related genes, suggesting that increased neuronal activity required increased supplies of energy."
The SPANX gene family of cancer/testis-specific antigens: Rapid evolution and amplification in African great apes and hominids,"['Kouprina, N', 'Mullokandov, M', 'Rogozin, IB', 'Collins, NK', 'Solomon, G', 'Otstot, J', 'Risinger, JI', 'Koonin, EV', 'Barrett, JC', 'Larionov, V']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0308532100,MAR 2 2004,40,"Human sperm protein associated with the nucleus on the X chromosome (SPANX) genes comprise a gene family with five known members (SPANX-A1, -A2, -B, -C and -D), encoding cancer/testis-specific antigens that are potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. These highly similar paralogous genes cluster on the X chromosome at Xq27. We isolated and sequenced primate genomic clones homologous to human SPANX Analysis of these clones and search of the human genome sequence revealed an uncharacterized group of genes, SPANX-N, which are present in all primates as well as in mouse and rat. In humans, four SPANX-N genes comprise a series of tandem duplicates at Xq27; a fifth member of this subfamily is located at Xp11. Similarly to SPANX-A/D, human SPANX-N genes are expressed in normal testis and some melanoma cell lines; testis-specific expression of SPANX is also conserved in mouse. Analysis of the taxonomic distribution of the long and short forms of the intron indicates that SPANX-N is the ancestral form, from which the SPANX-A/D subfamily evolved in the common ancestor of the hominoid lineage. Strikingly, the coding sequences of the SPANX genes evolved much faster than the intron and the 5' untranslated region. There is a strong correlation between the rates of evolution of synonymous and nonsynonymous codon positions, both of which are accelerated 2-fold or more compared to the noncoding sequences. Thus, evolution of the SPANX family appears to have involved positive selection that affected not only the protein sequence but also the synonymous sites in the coding sequence."

Between six and eight 20 km long permanent transects were walked on a monthly basis from January 1997 to August 1999 to assess large mammal populations as well as human intrusion. There were no obvious seasonal or monthly trends in elephant, gorilla or non-human primate densities.

Overall, it appears that human activities negatively influence the distribution of most of the large forest animals in Dzanga-Sangha. Elephants in particular were significantly less common in areas used by humans, but also other species such as non-human primates showed lower densities closer to the main road and the town of Bayanga. This study confirms the findings of previous studies that roads have a negative impact on wildlife populations.

Results of this study stress the need for conservation of large uninterrupted forest blocks to maintain wildlife populations at normal levels. Simply creating roads, even within a protected Central African forest, is likely to have negative impacts on wildlife populations."
"Hypothesis for the causes and periodicity of repetitive linear enamel hypoplasia in large, wild African (Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla) and Asian (Pongo pygmaeus) apes","['Skinner, MF', 'Hopwood, D']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10314,MAR 2004,31,"Repetitive linear enamel hypoplasia (rLEH) is often observed in recent large-bodied apes from Africa and Asia as well as Mid- to Late Miocene sites from Spain to China. The ubiquity and periodicity of rLEH are not understood. Its potential as an ontogenetic marker of developmental stress in threatened species (as well as their ancient relatives) makes rLEH an important if enigmatic problem. We report research designed to show the periodicity of rLEH among West African Pan troglodytes (12 male, 32 female), Gorilla gorilla (10 male, 10 female), and Bornean and Sumatran Pongo pygmaeus (11 male, 9 female, 9 unknown) from collections in Europe. Two methods were employed. In the common chimpanzees and gorillas, the space between adjacent, macroscopically visible LEH grooves on teeth with two or more episodes was expressed as an absolute measure and as a ratio of complete unworn crown height. In the orangutans, the number of perikymata between episode onsets, as well as duration of rLEH, was determined from scanning electron micrographs of casts of incisors and canines. We conclude that stress in the form of LEH commences as early as 2.5 years of age in all taxa and lasts for several years, and even longer in orangutans; the stress is not chronic but episodic; the stressor has a strong tendency to occur in pulses of two occurrences each; and large apes from both land masses exhibit rLEH with an average periodicity of 6 months (or multiples thereof, Sumatran orangutans seem to show only annual stress), but this needs further research. This is supported by evidence of spacing between rLEH as well as perikymata counts. Duration of stress in orangutans averages about 6 weeks. Finally, the semiannual stressor transcends geographic and temporal boundaries, and is attributed to regular moisture cycles associated with the intertropical convergence zone modified by the monsoon. While seasonal cycles can influence both disease and nutritional stress, it is likely the combination of seasonal variation in fruiting cycles with specific stressors (malaria and/or intestinal parasites, especially hookworm) that results in this widespread phenomenon. This seasonal stress is sufficiently common and of long duration (6 weeks on average in orangutans) that we think rLEH may reflect significant stress in recent and, inferentially, fossil apes. Increasing seasonality may have impinged negatively on later Miocene apes, especially if they lacked a clear birth peak or seasonality in their reproductive cycles. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Human cognitive ecology: An instructive framework for comparative primatology,"['Keller, JD']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20017,MAR 2004,2,"In this review, research on human cognitive ecology is compared with studies of the cognitive ecologies of apes-especially the common chimpanzee. The objective was to assess the feasibility of extending an activity-theory framework developed in studies of humans to an integrated approach for studying the cognitive accomplishments and skills of other primates living in the wild. Six generalizations were abstracted from studies of humans: 1) Social and material environments are arranged to facilitate production. 2) Human activity is shaped by conceptual and cultural principles that provide underlying logic for working knowledge and practice. 3) Schemata (multimodal, mental representations of procedures, strategies, and techniques) govern performance in a domain. 4) Working knowledge, skills, and social identities are coconstructed in communities of practice. 5) Rehearsal improves skilled performances, from which reputations as well as material products are derived. 6) Planning and emergence are in productive tension in human practices. These generalizations are applied to findings in the literature regarding the behavior of chimpanzees and other apes in the wild to assess the potential utility of a situated-activity approach for comparative studies of primate cognition. It is argued in the Discussion that schemata constitute a common core of higher primate intelligence. Planning, emergence, and alterations of the environment to facilitate production further characterize human and chimpanzee or gorilla behaviors to varying degrees. Less apparent in the nonhuman-primate literature is evidence of governing principles, rehearsal, and skill-based reputations or identities entailing theories of mind. Nonetheless, recent observations in the wild suggest that further research is warranted to explore the rudiments of each of these components to enhance our understanding of the ecology of primate cognition and its evolutionary history.

We presented 57 chimpanzees with three experimental conditions in randomized order: an experimenter offered a banana to the focal subject (Focal), to a cagemate of the focal subject (In-Cage) and to a chimpanzee in an adjacent cage (Adjacent) while a second experimenter recorded the first and second responses of the focal subject in all three conditions. The chimpanzees' behaviour was mostly visual or bimodal in the Focal condition, changing to auditory behaviour or disengagement in the In-Cage and Adjacent conditions. Thus, with no explicit training and on their first trials in all instances, the chimpanzees tactically deployed their communicative behaviours in the visual and auditory domains in accordance with the manipulated attentional and intentional status of a human observer.

"Allostatic load, social status and stress hormones: the costs of social status matter","['Goymann, W', 'Wingfield, JC']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.08.007,MAR 2004,191,"Cooperation and social support are the major advantages of living in social groups. However, there are also disadvantages arising from social conflict and competition. Social conflicts may increase allostatic load, which is reflected in increased concentrations of glucocorticoids. We applied the emerging concept of allostasis to investigate the relation between social status and glucocorticoid concentrations. Animals in a society experience different levels of allostatic load and these differences may predict relative glucocorticoid concentrations of dominant and subordinate individuals. We reviewed the available data from free-ranging animals and generated, for each sex separately, phylogenetic independent contrasts of allostatic load and relative glucocorticoid concentrations. Our results suggest that the relative allostatic load of social status predicts whether dominants or subordinates express higher or lower concentrations of glucocorticoids. There was a significant correlation between allostatic load of dominance and relative glucocorticoid concentrations in both females and males. When allostatic load was higher in dominants than in subordinates, dominants expressed higher levels of glucocorticoids; when allostatic load was similar in dominants and subordinates, there were only minor differences in glucocorticoid concentrations; and when allostatic load was lower in dominants than in subordinates, subordinates expressed higher levels of glucocorticoids than dominants. To our knowledge, this is the first model that consistently explains rank differences in glucocorticoid concentrations of different species and sexes. The heuristic concept of allostasis thus provides a testable framework for future studies of how social status is reflected in glucocorticoid concentrations.

Of these, 9 matched the 3' region of the dynamin 1 gene (DNM1) on chromosome 9q34 with >90% identity. Fluoresence in situ hybridisation and PCR amplification were used to localise a large number of DNM1-like sequences to human chromosomes 15 and Y PCR amplification of overlapping Y-linked YACs allowed a more accurate mapping of the Y-linked DNM1-like cDNAs to a euchromatic locus in close proximity to heterochromatin at Yq11.23. A search of the genome database identified 64 highly homologous copies of the DNM1 fragment. Most of these copies were localised to chromosomes 15 and Y, but others mapped to chromosomes 5, 8, 10, 12, 19 and 22. These sequences exhibit all the major features of a duplicon and have been designated DNM1DN (DNM1 duplicon). Evolutionary studies using fluorescence in situ hybridisation indicate that transposition of the DNM1DN sequence to chromosome 15 took place earlier in primate evolution than the transposition to the Y chromosome. The translocation to the Y took place at a time following the divergence of a common ancestor from gorilla, approximately 4-7 million years ago."
Nucleotide diversity in gorillas,"['Yu, N', 'Jensen-Seaman, MI', 'Chemnick, L', 'Ryder, O', 'Li, WH']",GENETICS,10.1534/genetics.166.3.1375,MAR 2004,50,"Comparison of the levels of nucleotide diversity in humans and apes may provide valuable information for inferring the demographic history of these species, the effect of social structure on genetic diversity, patterns of past migration, and signatures of past selection events. Previous DNA sequence data from both the mitochondrial and the nuclear genomes suggested a much higher level of nucleotide diversity in the African apes than in humans. Noting that the nuclear DNA data from the apes were very limited, we previously conducted a DNA polymorphism study in humans and another in chimpanzees and bonobos, using 50 DNA segments randomly chosen from the noncoding, nonrepetitive parts of the human genome. The data revealed that the nucleotide diversity (pi) in bonobos (0.077%) is actually lower that) that in humans (0.087%) and that pi in chimpanzees (0.134%) is only 50% higher than that in humans. In the present study we sequenced the same 50 segments in 15 western lowland gorillas and estimated pi to be 0.158%. This is the highest value among the African apes but is only about two times higher than that in humans. Interestingly, available mtDNA sequence data also suggest a twofold higher nucleotide diversity in gorillas than in humans, but suggest a threefold higher nucleotide diversity in chimpanzees than in humans. The higher mtDNA diversity in chimpanzees might be due to the unique pattern in the evolution of chimpanzee mtDNA. From the nuclear DNA pi values, we estimated that the long-term effective population sizes Of humans, bonobos, chimpanzees, and gorillas are, respectively, 10,400, 12,300, 21,300, and 25,200."

The Acadian-specific 216G-->A mutation in exon 3 and a variant 9-repeat VNTR allele (designated VNTR(t,t)) in intron 5 are in complete linkage disequilibrium. (The usual form of the allele is referred to as VNTR(t).) To gain insight into the structure, diversity, and evolution of the VNTR, we analyzed individuals from seven different populations, as well as nonhuman primates and rodents. The 2-, 3-, and 6-repeat VNTR alleles were the most common. Four novel alleles containing 1, 5, 7, and 10 repeats were detected with frequencies of 0.002, 0.029, 0.005, and 0.001, respectively. The USHIC VNTR region is highly conserved among primates, but not between primates and rodents. Five unrelated individuals had a 3-repeat VNTR(t,t) allele. Haplotype analysis indicates that the 9-repeat VNTR(t,t) and the 3-repeat VNTR(t,t) alleles arose independently. However, the 9-repeat VNTR(t,t) and 6-repeat VNTR(t) alleles shared the same haplotype, suggesting an expansion from 6(t) to 9(t,t). (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

In studies utilizing urinary measures of hormone levels, this window often spans 2 h or longer. In this study, we compared chimpanzee urinary cortisol levels in sample pairs collected within 1 h of each other in an attempt to validate the use of a time window for sample collection. Chimpanzees were housed at the University of Louisiana New Iberia Research Center and trained to urinate into a paper cup on command; a total of 41 sample pairs were included in this analysis. We found that mean cortisol levels in the two sets of samples, collected within 1 h or less of each other, were significantly different; the mean cortisol level of the first set of samples was significantly higher than that of the second set. This hormone's diurnal pattern of secretion accounts for this significant decrease over a very short time period. We conclude that collection methodologies involving time windows of 1 h or longer need to take into account such rapid changes in levels of excreted hormone. We advocate the use of methodological and statistical corrections to decrease the impact of short-term fluctuations in urinary cortisol. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Levels of abstraction in orangutan (Pongo abelii) categorization,"['Vonk, J', 'MacDonald, SE']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/0735-7036.118.1.3,MAR 2004,20,"Levels of abstraction have rarely been manipulated in studies of natural concept formation in nonhumans. Isolated examples have indicated that animals, relative to humans, may learn concepts at varying levels of abstraction with differential ease. The ability of 6 orangutans (Pongo abelii) of various ages to make natural concept discriminations at 3 levels of abstraction was therefore investigated. The orangutans were rewarded for selecting photos of orangutans instead of humans and other primates (concrete level), primates instead of other animals (intermediate level), and animals instead of nonanimals (abstract level) in a 2-choice touch screen procedure. The results suggest that, like a gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) tested previously (Vonk & MacDonald, 2002), orangutans can learn concepts at each level of abstraction, and unlike other nonhumans, most of these subjects rapidly learned the intermediate level discrimination."

Although occasional infection with SIV, SRV, or SFV in persons occupationally exposed to NHPs has been reported, the characteristics and significance of these zoonotic infections are not fully defined. Surveillance for simian retroviruses at three research centers and two zoos identified no SIV, SRV, or STLV infection in 187 participants. However, 10 of 187 persons (5.3%) tested positive for SFV antibodies by Western blot (WB) analysis. Eight of the 10 were males, and 3 of the 10 worked at zoos. SFV integrase gene (int) and gag sequences were PCR amplified from the peripheral blood lymphocytes available from 9 of the 10 persons. Phylogenetic analysis showed SFV infection originating from chimpanzees (n = 8) and baboons (n = 1). SFV seropositivity for periods of 8 to 26 years (median, 22 years) was documented for six workers for whom archived serum samples were available, demonstrating long-standing SFV infection. All 10 persons reported general good health, and secondary transmission of SFV was not observed in three wives available for WB and PCR testing. Additional phylogenetic analysis of int and gag sequences provided the first direct evidence identifying the source chimpanzees of the SFV infection in two workers. This study documents more frequent infection with SFV than with other simian retroviruses in persons working with NHPs and provides important information on the natural history and species origin of these infections. Our data highlight the importance of studies to better define the public health implications of zoonotic SFV infections."
Perceptual simulation in property verification,"['Solomon, KO', 'Barsalou, LW']",MEMORY & COGNITION,10.3758/BF03196856,MAR 2004,83,"If people represent concepts with perceptual simulations, two predictions follow in the property verification task (e.g., Is face a property of GORILLA?). First, perceptual variables such as property size should predict the performance of neutral subjects, because these variables determine the ease of processing properties in perceptual simulations (i.e., perceptual effort). Second, uninstructed neutral subjects should spontaneously construct simulations to verify properties and therefore perform similarly to imagery subjects asked explicitly to use images (i.e., instructional equivalence). As predicted, neutral subjects exhibited both perceptual effort and instructional equivalence, consistent with the assumption that they construct perceptual simulations spontaneously to verify properties. Notably, however, this pattern occurred only when highly associated false properties prevented the use of a word association strategy. In other conditions that used unassociated false properties, the associative strength between concept and property words became a diagnostic cue for true versus false responses, so that associative strength became a better predictor of verification than simulation. This pattern indicates that conceptual tasks engender mixtures of simulation and word association, and that researchers must deter word association strategies when the goal is to assess conceptual knowledge."
Reversal of neurologic deficit in an adult gorilla with severe symptomatic lumbar stenosis,"['Wolfla, CE', 'Puckett, TA']",SPINE,10.1097/01.BRS.0000112075.03500.5B,MAR 1 2004,0,"Study Design. A case report is presented.

Objective. To describe a case of severe symptomatic lumbar stenosis in an adult gorilla successfully treated with decompressive surgery.

Summary of Background Data. Although spinal degenerative disease is thought to be less common in apes than in humans, gorillas and bonobos are known to have higher rates of disease than other African apes.

Methods. A 42-year-old female gorilla presented with a history of progressive lower extremity weakness. She was unable to ambulate normally or climb, pulling herself around with her arms. Her keeper did not believe she was incontinent. Physical examination revealed that ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion were absent on the right and weak on the left. Radiographs revealed disc space narrowing with osteophytes at the last mobile segment. Myelogram and computed tomography revealed severe spinal stenosis at the last two mobile segments. Under general anesthesia, a standard laminectomy and bilateral lateral recess decompression were performed.

Results. There were no anesthetic or wound complications. The gorilla was noted to have improved ankle strength bilaterally on postoperative day 1. On postoperative day 3, the animal began to walk and climb. At 20 months, the animal is back to her neurologic baseline.

Conclusions. Symptomatic lumbar degenerative disease with neurologic compromise may be treated surgically, with excellent outcome, in the adult gorilla. Though this is an unusual situation, knowledge that this is a potentially reversible condition may benefit other gorillas in captivity."

The endogenous retroviral locus ERVWE1 is a bona fide gene involved in hominoid placental physiology,"['Mallet, F', 'Bouton, O', 'Prudhomme, S', 'Cheynet, V', 'Oriol, G', 'Bonnaud, B', 'Lucotte, G', 'Duret, L', 'Mandrand, B']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0305763101,FEB 10 2004,125,"The definitive demonstration of a role for a recently acquired gene is a difficult task, requiring exhaustive genetic investigations and functional analysis. The situation is indeed much more complicated when facing multicopy gene families, because most or portions of the gene are conserved among the hundred copies of the family. This is the case for the ERVWE1 locus of the human endogenous retrovirus W family (HERV-W), which encodes an envelope glycoprotein (syncytin) likely involved in trophoblast differentiation. Here we describe, in 155 individuals, the positional conservation of this locus and the preservation of the envelope ORF. Sequencing of the critical elements of the ERVWE1 provirus showed a striking conservation among the 48 alleles of 24 individuals, including the LTR elements involved in the transcriptional machinery, the splice sites involved in the maturation of subgenomic Env mRNA, and the Env ORF. The functionality and tissue specificity of the 5' LTR were demonstrated, as well as the fusogenic activity of the envelope polymorphic variants. Such functions were also shown to be preserved in the orthologous loci isolated from chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon. This functional preservation among humans and during evolution strongly argued for the involvement of this recently acquired retroviral envelope glycoprotein in hominoid placental physiology."
Sexual behavior and hormonal estrus cycles in captive aged lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla),"['Atsalis, S', 'Margulis, SW', 'Bellem, A', 'Wielebnowski, N', 'MENOPAUSE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20010,FEB 2004,18,"To evaluate whether observed cycles in proceptive behavior in aging lowland gorilla females (age 40+) at Brookfield Zoo were driven by ovarian activity, we compared monthly behavioral data to estradiol and progestogen cycles based on fecal hormone assessments. Progestogen peaks showed regularity and close coincidence with monthly sexual behaviors. Estradiol was more variable. Progestogen peaks varied between 22+/-5 days for the control female (29 years old), to 24+/-2.5 and 29+/-8 for the two aged subjects. In the first aged female, which was housed with other females and a silverback, the high degree of cyclicity in sexual behavior, regularity of progestogen cycles, and close concordance between hormonal cycling and sexual behavior strongly compared to patterns found (in this and other studies) in gorilla females < 35 years old. Cyclical progestogen peaks were longer and more variable in the second aged female-perhaps because she lacked the social mediation of other females or a male. For husbandry reasons she is not housed with the gorilla group, behavioral data were not collected from her. The value of our longitudinal study is in obtaining reproductive profiles of primate females that are approaching maximum lifespan. This pilot study is part of a larger research project on reproductive senescence that will include other captive females > 35 years old, a population that is rapidly increasing in North American zoos as gorillas continue to age.

"Male life history and the unusual adult sex ratios of redfronted lemur, Eulemur fulvus rufus, groups","['Ostner, J', 'Kappeler, PM', 'PROPITHECUS-VERREAUXI']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.05.012,FEB 2004,43,"In group-living species, theoretical considerations indicate the existence of a fundamental conflict of interest between the sexes over the adult sex ratio within groups. Females may derive certain benefits from living with many males. Males, in contrast, should generally try to monopolize access to a group of females. Which sex ultimately controls adult group sex ratio is poorly known. We examined this conflict between the sexes in redfronted lemurs, Malagasy primates characterized by an unusual lack of female-biased adult sex ratios. Using various demographic and behavioural data from several groups collected over 6 years, we examined (1) the proximate determinants of this unusual sex ratio, (2) the temporal distribution of female fertile phases within groups as a determinant of male monopolization potential, (3) sources of between-group variation in the adult sex ratio, and (4) possible social benefits of the relatively high number of males for both sexes. Birth and mortality rates were not sex biased and males migrated considerably more frequently than females, providing no proximate explanation for the unusual sex ratio. However, certain life history traits (fast maturation, short interbirth intervals) may ultimately play a role because they act to facilitate joint group transfers of male coalitions. Despite a relatively small female group size and an associated high monopolization potential, female oestrous synchrony may prevent the formation of single-male groups. Reduced male group size seems to be the main predictor of take-over rate, and, thus, infanticide risk, suggesting that both sexes may benefit from the high number of coresident males, thereby considerably defusing the conflict of interest between the sexes.

Social dynamics of captive western lowland gorillas living in all-male groups,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Kuhar, CW', 'Lukas, KE', 'Maple, TL']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/156853904322890807,FEB 2004,17,"Male mammals show considerable variation in their association (e.g. single-male, multi-male, all-male groups) and relationship (e.g. affiliative versus intolerant) patterns. Although a number of primates have been observed to form all-male groups, studies of the social dynamics of these groups are limited. This study examined the social interactions of 25 male western lowland gorillas living in nine captive all-male groups. Over 1,300 hours of data were collected using group scan and all-occurrence sampling methodologies. Groups were cohesive, with males spending approximately one-third of their time within 5 meters of another individual. Although complete linear dominance hierarchies within a group were not observed, dominance relationships between individuals were evident for the majority (66%) of dyads. Social interactions varied as a function of age, with subadults engaging in more affiliative behavior and less non-contact aggression than either blackbacks or silverbacks. Visual/olfactory access to females increased non-contact aggression between males. Such results are similar to those found for all-male groups of mountain gorillas in the wild and demonstrate that all-male groups can be a cohesive social unit in this species. They also raise the questions of why all-male groups have rarely been observed in wild populations and how social, ecological and anthropogenic factors influence male sociality."
Recent evolutionary origin within the primate lineage of two pseudogenes with similarity to members of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily,"['Eketjall, S', 'Jornvall, H', 'Lonnerberg, P', 'Kobayashi, S', 'Ibanez, CF']",CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES,10.1007/s00018-003-3383-2,FEB 2004,2,"Using a search engine called Motifer, we searched the public database of the human genome for genes matching a consensus pattern of cysteine residues derived from members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. We identified two genes (named MDF451 and MDF628) that display sequence similarity to members of the TGF-beta superfamily in the arrangement of six conserved cysteine residues. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that MDF451 and MDF628 constitute a distinct subgroup within the TGF-beta superfamily, distantly related to the GDNF subfamily of ligands. Both genes could be identified in several primate species in addition to human, including chimpanzee, gorilla, guereza, and green and gray monkey, but not in rodents or other non-primate mammals, and appear not to be present in the genomes of mouse, rat or zebrafish. RNAs for MDF451 and MDF628 were expressed at low levels within distinct regions of the human central nervous system, including adult cerebellum, adult spinal cord and fetal brain. Despite expression at the RNA level, both genes presented a transcribed upstream stop codon that would prevent translation of the TGF-beta-like reading frame. The coding potential of alternative reading frames was not immediately apparent. The two genes may represent TGF-beta-like pseudogenes that have recently appeared in evolution in a common ancestor of the primate lineage by duplication from a GDNF/TGF-beta-like ancestral gene."
"Behavioral responses of gorillas to habituation in the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African Republic","['Blom, A', 'Cipolletta, C', 'Brunsting, AMH', 'Prins, HHT']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/B:IJOP.0000014649.15973.3a,FEB 2004,25,"We monitored the impact of habituation for tourism through changes in gorillas' behavior during the habituation process at Bai Hokou (Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African Republic) from August 1996 to December 1999. From August 1998 onwards we focused on one gorilla group: the Munye. During the habituation process, it became increasingly easier to locate and to remain with the gorillas. Their initial reactions of aggression, fear and vocalization upon contact were replaced increasingly by ignoring us. Curiosity appeared to be an intermediate stage in the process. The way in which contacts with the Munye ended became more subdued over time. Regular daily contact is important in promoting habituation. Likewise, contacting gorillas while they are in a tree or in dense forest provides positive results compared to open habitat. Contacts within 10 m and contacts without forewarning the gorillas of observer presence, e.g., via tongue clacking, should be avoided. As of December 1999, habituation had progressed well; habituation of western gorillas is feasible. However, the gorillas experience negative effects during the habituation process, showing, for example, an increase in daily path length, and reactions of aggression, fear and vocalization upon contact. Impacts diminish over time. Given these and other potentially negative effects, the decision to begin habituation should not be taken lightly."

We obtained swab fluid from the base of both vesicles and ulcers and collected blood for further separation into serum, plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for detection of antibody to herpesvirus by serology and herpesvirus DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using consensus degenerate primers. Serology was positive for human EBV IgG but negative for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immunoglobulin (IgM), as well as for both human cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus IgG and IgM. Upon PCR, we obtained a 232-bp product of virus DNA from PBMC, but not from lesions, serum or plasma. We confirmed the positive result by direct sequencing and compared the nucleotide sequence with other nucleotide sequences applying the BLAST program from GenBank. The sequence was similar to lymphocryptovirus of macaque (93%), marmoset (93%), gorilla (90%) and human EBV (90%). We aligned this sequence with other sequences in GenBank and performed phylogenetic analysis, showing that it probably belongs to the gammaherpesvirus group."
How do apes ape?,"['Whiten, A', 'Horner, I', 'Litchfield, CA', 'Marshall-Pescini, S']",LEARNING & BEHAVIOR,NA,FEB 2004,159,"In the wake of telling critiques of the foundations on which earlier conclusions were based, the last 15 years have witnessed a renaissance in the study of social learning in apes. As a result, we are able to review 31 experimental studies from this period in which social learning in chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans has been investigated. The principal question framed at the beginning of this era, Do apes ape? has been answered in the affirmative, at least in certain conditions. The more interesting question now is, thus, How do apes ape? Answering this question has engendered richer taxonomies of the range of social-learning processes at work and new methodologies to uncover them. Together, these studies suggest that apes ape by employing a portfolio of alternative social-learning processes in flexibly adaptive ways, in conjunction with nonsocial learning. We conclude by sketching the kind of decision tree that appears to underlie the deployment of these alternatives."

A gradient of silent substitution rate in the human pseudoautosomal region,"['Filatov, DA']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msh032,FEB 2004,25,"It has been demonstrated that recombination in the human p-arm pseudoautosomal region (p-PAR) is at least twenty times more frequent than the genomic average of similar to1 cM/Mb, which may affect substitution patterns and rates in this region. Here I report the analysis of substitution patterns and rates in 10 human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan genes across the p-PAR. Between species silent divergence in the p-PAR forms a gradient, increasing toward the telomere. The correlation of silent divergence with distance from the p-PAR boundary is highly significant (rho = 0.911, P < 0.001). After exclusion of the CpG dinucleotides this correlation is still significant (&rho; = 0.89, P < 0.01), thus the substitution rate gradient cannot be explained solely by the differences in the extent of methylation across the p-PAR. Frequent recombination in the PAR may result in a relatively strong effect of biased gene conversion (BGC), which, because of the increased probability of fixation of the G or C nucleotides at (A or T)/(G or Q segregating sites, may affect substitution rates. BGC, however, does not seem to be the factor creating the substitution rate gradient in the p-PAR, because the only gradient is still detactable if only A<->T and G<->C substitutions are taken into account (rho = 0.82, P < 0.01). I hypothesize that the substitution rate gradient in the p-PAR is due to the mutagenic effect of recombination, which is very frequent in the distal human p-PAR and might be lower near the p-PAR boundary."
Unreliable mtDNA data due to nuclear insertions: a cautionary tale from analysis of humans and other great apes,"['Thalmann, O', 'Hebler, J', 'Poinar, HN', 'Paabo, S', 'Vigilant, L']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.02070.x,FEB 2004,149,"Analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequence variation has been used extensively to study the evolutionary relationships of individuals and populations, both within and across species. So ubiquitous and easily acquired are mtDNA data that it has been suggested that such data could serve as a taxonomic 'barcode' for an objective species classification scheme. However, there are technical pitfalls associated with the acquisition of mtDNA data. One problem is the presence of translocated pieces of mtDNA in the nuclear genome of many taxa that may be mistaken for authentic organellar mtDNA. We assessed the extent to which such 'numt' sequences may pose an overlooked problem in analyses of mtDNA from humans and apes. Using long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we generated necessarily authentic mtDNA sequences for comparison with sequences obtained using typical methods for a segment of the mtDNA control region in humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans. Results revealed that gorillas are notable for having such a variety of numt sequences bearing high similarity to authentic mtDNA that any analysis of mtDNA using standard approaches is rendered impossible. Studies on humans, chimpanzees, bonobos or orangutans are apparently less problematic. One implication is that explicit measures need to be taken to authenticate mtDNA sequences in newly studied taxa or when any irregularities arise. Furthermore, some taxa may not be amenable to analysis of mtDNA variation at all."
Personality measurement on non-human primates.,"['Santillan-Doherty, AM', 'Munoz-Delgado, J', 'Nicolini, H']",SALUD MENTAL,NA,FEB 2004,2,"There are currently many studies on the personality of non-human primates and other animals. These include a variety of species as well as different research lines and methodologies, ranging in scope from informal reports and single case studies to well-designed research.

In addition to the need to demonstrate that primate personality exists as a legitimate study subject, extensive reviews on this topic show that the objective of most of the research performed in primates is centered on the description of personality dimensions, the measurement of personality traits, and their correlation with several biological, social and even ecological variables, and has used structural personality methodology. This method analyzes information from many interrelated variables, where two or more highly correlated traits reflect the existence of a personality dimension. This method has been used in the construction of ""instruments"" that evaluate human and animal personality, and has demonstrated its usefulness in basic personality research such as the correlation of biological, genetic, and social variables with personality traits, as well a the study of individual, cultural, and comparative variability.

By using human models as a parameter, some authors have concluded that personality research in non-human primates complies with the criteria to be considered feasible. Studies have shown that there is an empirical relation between personality and behavior. For example, there is a positive correlation between the sociability dimension of personality in rhesus macaques and their affiliative behavior scores. Also, that most of the rating instruments used have shown good inter- and intra-observer agreement; finally, that trait ratings have been useful in predicting behavioral and even physiological outcomes; for example, a relationship between dominance and testosterone levels.

Finally, in this report we also describe the most adequate methodology proposed in the literature for the study of primate personality: the combined use of both ethological coding and trait rating. A brief description of the most commonly used instruments is provided, along with some of the findings generated by such instruments. For example, the Battery of 25 Adjectives, used by several research groups, has shown the influence of both mothers and alpha males, personality on their infants, or the relation between personality and age, sex and hierarchy. Other groups have used reactivity scales to evaluate temperament, while still others have used the Emotions Profile Index (or a variation) to evaluate the distribution of emotions among a primate group. More recently, several groups have implemented human personality instruments in primate studies such as the Five Factor Model, finding that other dimensions are added when evaluating other species; for example, dominance, when applied to gorillas or chimpanzees. The use of this model has also allowed for the organization and integration of many other studies.

Animal research already plays an important role in the development of psychology. Learning, perception and even psychopathology have profited from it. The growing interest in primate personality and the recent efforts to integrate the diverse research lines developed until now, suggest the short-term possibility of using animal personality research as a useful tool in the understanding of genetic, biological and ecological influences of human personality."
Phylogenetic relationships in the Lymphocryptovirus genus of the Gammaherpesvirinae,"['Gerner, CS', 'Dolan, A', 'McGeoch, DJ']",VIRUS RESEARCH,10.1016/j.viruses.2003.10.011,FEB 2004,17,"Complete DNA sequences were determined for the glycoprotein B (gB) genes of four viruses from the genus Lymphocryptovirus, whose hosts had been assigned as baboon, orangutan, chimpanzee and gorilla. Together with published sequences for the gB genes of three lymphocryptoviruses, namely the human pathogen Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a rhesus monkey virus and a marmoset virus, the sequences were used to investigate evolutionary relationships in the genus. The chimpanzee and orangutan viruses' sequences were found to be so close that it is unlikely both represent natural infections in these hosts. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the New World marmoset virus lineage formed a sister clade to that of the Old World viruses, consistent with a cospeciational separation. Within the Old World virus group, resolution of branching pattern was incomplete, and suggestive of a complex history. In particular, it was inferred that separation of the EBV lineage from that of the gorilla virus plus the chimpanzee/orangutan virus may have predated separation of the present day host species.

Three adult orangutans frequently stripped leaves and twigs from a branch provided (tool-making), and then inserted the tool into a hole to obtain foodstuffs (tool-using). A 5-year-old female juvenile usually used the tools that adult orangutans had previously used, but rarely made tools herself. A 2-year-old male infant did not use any tools. The adult orangutans tend to leave one to several leaves at the top of the branch than to leave many leaves on the branch or to strip all leaves. It seemed likely that tools with appropriate leaves are easier to insert into holes and obtain more foodstuffs, compared with branches with many leaves or sticks without any leaves. When the orangutans were unable to insert a tool into a hole, they usually modified the tool and/or changed their tool-using technique, such as changing how they grasped the tool. These findings are discussed from the perspectives of the orangutan's behavioral flexibility regarding tool-use skills and hierarchical organization in food-processing techniques.

PyEvolve: a toolkit for statistical modelling of molecular evolution,"['Butterfield, A', 'Vedagiri, V', 'Lang, E', 'Lawrence, C', 'Wakefield, MJ', 'Isaev, A', 'Huttley, GA']",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,10.1186/1471-2105-5-1,JAN 5 2004,21,"Background: Examining the distribution of variation has proven an extremely profitable technique in the effort to identify sequences of biological significance. Most approaches in the field, however, evaluate only the conserved portions of sequences - ignoring the biological significance of sequence differences. A suite of sophisticated likelihood based statistical models from the field of molecular evolution provides the basis for extracting the information from the full distribution of sequence variation. The number of different problems to which phylogeny-based maximum likelihood calculations can be applied is extensive. Available software packages that can perform likelihood calculations suffer from a lack of flexibility and scalability, or employ error-prone approaches to model parameterisation.

Results: Here we describe the implementation of PyEvolve, a toolkit for the application of existing, and development of new, statistical methods for molecular evolution. We present the object architecture and design schema of PyEvolve, which includes an adaptable multi-level parallelisation schema. The approach for defining new methods is illustrated by implementing a novel dinucleotide model of substitution that includes a parameter for mutation of methylated CpG's, which required 8 lines of standard Python code to define. Benchmarking was performed using either a dinucleotide or codon substitution model applied to an alignment of BRCA1 sequences from 20 mammals, or a 10 species subset. Up to five-fold parallel performance gains over serial were recorded. Compared to leading alternative software, PyEvolve exhibited significantly better real world performance for parameter rich models with a large data set, reducing the time required for optimisation from similar to10 days to similar to6 hours.

Conclusion: PyEvolve provides flexible functionality that can be used either for statistical modelling of molecular evolution, or the development of new methods in the field. The toolkit can be used interactively or by writing and executing scripts. The toolkit uses efficient processes for specifying the parameterisation of statistical models, and implements numerous optimisations that make highly parameter rich likelihood functions solvable within hours on multi-cpu hardware. PyEvolve can be readily adapted in response to changing computational demands and hardware configurations to maximise performance.

Sex differences in play among western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) infants: Implications for adult behavior and social structure,"['Maestripieri, D', 'Ross, SR']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10295,JAN 2004,26,"Mammalian play is believed to improve motor skills as well as facilitate the development of social relationships. Given the marked sexual dimorphism in gorilla body size and the role assumed by the male in protecting the group from conspecifics and predators, the motor-training hypothesis of play predicts that male infants should exhibit higher frequencies of social play than female infants, and that males should prefer to play with other males. Given that adult female gorillas are strongly attracted to adult breeding males and form only weak social bonds with unrelated adult females, the social-relationship hypothesis of play predicts that female infants should prefer to play with males. These hypotheses were tested in a 22-month study of 12 gorilla infants, aged between 0-5 years, living in three zoological parks in Chicago and Atlanta. Consistent with the hypotheses, male infants played more than female infants did, and both male and female infants preferred to play with males rather than with females. These findings suggest that sex differences in play in the great apes and other primates can be predicted by the characteristics of adult behavior and social structure above and beyond the patterns of sex-biased dispersal or coalition formation with same-sex kin.

The animal described here showed similar features to cases of trisomy 16 and 18 (human trisomy 13 and 18, respectively) reported previously in nonhuman primates.

In the first place to find a genetic explanation to understand the genomic affinity, very narrow in many cases, in front of the reality, with abyssal differences in behavior, which undervalue the significance of the genomic resemblance between the alive beings. The second movement is directed to ethological studies of the animal behavior and conduct, as a real fact. Special interest has the comparative studies since the two points of view, the genome and proteome in one side and ethology in front, both related to the Homo sapiens sapiens and his relatives, the great anthropomorphic apes, and consequently beside the names of Craig Venter, Collins and collaborators, artificers of the human genome sequencing, appear, unde revaluation, those of Leakey, Goodall, Fossey and Galdikas, specialists in anthropology and ethology of chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans.

What mirror self-recognition in nonhumans can tell us about aspects of self,"['Schilhab, TSS']",BIOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY,10.1023/B:BIPH.0000013249.23475.1f,JAN 2004,19,"Research on mirror self-recognition where animals are observed for mirror-guided self-directed behaviour has predominated the empirical approach to self-awareness in nonhuman primates. The ability to direct behaviour to previously unseen parts of the body such as the inside of the mouth, or grooming the eye by aid of mirrors has been interpreted as recognition of self and evidence of a self-concept. Three decades of research has revealed that contrary to monkeys, most great apes ( humans, common chimpanzees, pygmy chimpanzees and orangutans but not the gorilla) have convincingly displayed the capacity to recognize self by mirrors. The putative discontinuity in phylogeny of the ability suggests the existence of a so-called cognitive gap between great apes and the rest of the animal kingdom. However, methodological and theoretical inconsistencies regarding the empirical approach prevail. For instance, the observation of self-directed behaviour might not be as straightforward as it seems. In addition, the interpretation of mirror self-recognition as an index of self-awareness is challenged by alternative explanations, raising doubt about some assumptions behind mirror self-recognition. To evaluate the significance of the test in discussions of the concept of self this paper presents and analyses some major arguments raised on the mirror task."
"Cortical orofacial motor representation in old world monkeys, great apes, and humans - I. Quantitative analysis of cytoarchitecture","['Sherwood, CC', 'Holloway, RL', 'Erwin, JM', 'Schleicher, A', 'Zilles, K', 'Hof, PR']",BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION,10.1159/000075672,2004,30,"Social life in anthropoid primates is mediated by interindividual communication, involving movements of the orofacial muscles for the production of vocalization and gestural expression. Although phylogenetic diversity has been reported in the auditory and visual communication systems of primates, little is known about the comparative neuroanatomy that subserves orofacial movement. The current study reports results from quantitative image analysis of the region corresponding to orofacial representation of primary motor cortex (Brodmann's area 4) in several catarrhine primate species (Macaca fascicularis, Papio anubis, Pongo pygmaeus, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Homo sapiens) using the Grey Level Index method. This cortical region has been implicated in the execution of skilled motor activities such as voluntary facial expression and human speech. Density profiles of the laminar distribution of Nissl-stained neuronal somata were acquired from high-resolution images to quantify cytoarchitectural patterns. Despite general similarity in these profiles across catarrhines, multi-variate analysis showed that cytoarchitectural patterns of individuals were more similar within-species versus between-species. Compared to Old World monkeys, the orofacial representation of area 4 in great apes and humans was characterized by an increased relative thickness of layer III and overall lower cell volume densities, providing more neuropil space for interconnections. These phylogenetic differences in microstructure might provide an anatomical substrate for the evolution of greater volitional fine motor control of facial expressions in great apes and humans.

Stereologic analysis of chemoarchitecture","['Sherwood, CC', 'Holloway, RL', 'Erwin, JM', 'Hof, PR']",BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION,10.1159/000075673,2004,36,"This study presents a comparative stereologic investigation of neurofilament protein- and calcium-binding protein-immunoreactive neurons within the region of orofacial representation of primary motor cortex (Brodmann's area 4) in several catarrhine primate species (Macaca fascicularis, Papio anubis, Pongo pygmaeus, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Homo sapiens). Results showed that the density of interneurons involved in vertical interlaminar processing (i.e., calbindin- and calretinin-immunoreactive neurons) as well pyramidal neurons that supply heavily-myelinated projections (i.e., neurofilament protein- immunoreactive neurons) are correlated with overall neuronal density, whereas interneurons making transcolumnar connections (i.e., parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons) do not exhibit such a relationship. These results suggest that differential scaling rules apply to different neuronal subtypes depending on their functional role in cortical circuitry. For example, cortical columns across catarrhine species appear to involve a similar conserved network of intracolumnar inhibitory interconnections, as represented by the distribution of calbindin- and calretinin-immunoreactive neurons. The subpopulation of horizontally-oriented wide-arbor interneurons, on the other hand, increases in density relative to other interneuron subpopulations in large brains. Due to these scaling trends, the region of orofacial representation of primary motor cortex in great apes and humans is characterized by a greater proportion of neurons enriched in neurofilament protein and parvalbumin compared to the Old World monkeys examined. These modifications might contribute to the voluntary dexterous control of orofacial muscles in great ape and human communication. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel."

The evolutionary conservation of the human chitotriosidase gene in rodents and primates,"['Gianfrancesco, F', 'Musumeci, S']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000078009,2004,18,"Chitinases have been identified in a variety of organisms ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, known to specifically degrade chitin, an abundant polymer of N-acetyl-glucosamine. Recently a human chitinolytic enzyme called CHIT1 was discovered. CHIT1 is expressed by activated macrophages and hydrolyzes artificial chitotrioside substrates, but its specific function in humans is unknown, since it is generally believed that man completely lacks endogenous chitin and endogenous substrates for chitinases. An intriguing question is whether the chitotriosidase activity is just an evolutionary remnant or it has a physiological function in man. To test these hypotheses we utilized a ""phylogenomic"" approach performing accurate sequence analyses of this gene, coding for CHIT1, in rodents and primates. Inspecting the sequences available in public databases, we determined that this gene is conserved in rodents (mouse and rat) and primates (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, baboon, a common marmoset and black macaque). Moreover we found that a 24-base pair duplication that determines an enzymatically inactive human protein is not present in primates, suggesting that this polymorphism was created during human evolution. These results indicate that chitotriosidase is conserved across the evolutionary scale. Such conservation of the CHIT1 gene argues in favour of an important biological role. Copyright (C) 2003 S.

Origins of chromosomal rearrangement hotspots in the human genome: evidence from the AZFa deletion hotspots,"['Hurles, ME', 'Willey, D', 'Matthews, L', 'Hussain, SS']",GENOME BIOLOGY,10.1186/gb-2004-5-8-r55,2004,24,"Background: The origins of the recombination hotspots that are a common feature of both allelic and non-allelic homologous recombination in the human genome are poorly understood. We have investigated, by comparative sequencing, the evolution of two hotspots of non-allelic homologous recombination on the Y chromosome that lie within paralogous sequences known to sponsor deletions resulting in male infertility.

Results: These recombination hotspots are characterized by signatures of concerted evolution, which indicate that gene conversion between paralogs has been predominant in shaping their recent evolution. By contrast, the paralogous sequences that surround the hotspots exhibit little evidence of gene conversion. A second feature of these rearrangement hotspots is the extreme interspecific sequence divergence (around 2.5%) that places them among the most divergent orthologous sequences between humans and chimpanzees.

Conclusions: Several hominid-specific gene conversion events have rendered these hotspots better substrates for chromosomal rearrangements in humans than in chimpanzees or gorillas. Monte Carlo simulations of sequence evolution suggest that extreme sequence divergence is a direct consequence of gene conversion between paralogs. We propose that the coincidence of signatures of concerted evolution and recurrent breakpoints of chromosomal rearrangement (mapped at the sequence level) may enable the identification of putative rearrangement hotspots from analysis of comparative sequences from great apes."
Hotspots of mammalian chromosomal evolution,"['Bailey, JA', 'Baertsch, R', 'Kent, WJ', 'Haussler, D', 'Eichler, EE']",GENOME BIOLOGY,10.1186/gb-2004-5-4-r23,2004,139,"Background: Chromosomal evolution is thought to occur through a random process of breakage and rearrangement that leads to karyotype differences and disruption of gene order. With the availability of both the human and mouse genomic sequences, detailed analysis of the sequence properties underlying these breakpoints is now possible.

Results: We report an abundance of primate-specific segmental duplications at the breakpoints of syntenic blocks in the human genome. Using conservative criteria, we find that 25% (122/461) of all breakpoints contain greater than or equal to 10 kb of duplicated sequence. This association is highly significant ( p < 0.0001) when compared to a simulated random-breakage model. The significance is robust under a variety of parameters, multiple sets of conserved synteny data, and for orthologous breakpoints between and within chromosomes. A comparison of mouse lineage-specific breakpoints since the divergence of rat and mouse showed a similar association with regions associated with segmental duplications in the primate genome.

Conclusion: These results indicate that segmental duplications are associated with syntenic rearrangements, even when pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions are excluded. However, segmental duplications are not necessarily the cause of the rearrangements. Rather, our analysis supports a nonrandom model of chromosomal evolution that implicates specific regions within the mammalian genome as having been predisposed to both recurrent small-scale duplication and large-scale evolutionary rearrangements."
Recombination has little effect on the rate of sequence divergence in pseudoautosomal boundary 1 among humans and great apes,"['Yi, S', 'Summers, TJ', 'Pearson, NM', 'Li, WH']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.1777204,JAN 2004,22,"Recent studies indicated that recombination is strongly mutagenic. In particular, data from the mouse pseudoautosomal boundary (PAB) suggested that locally intensive recombination increased the nucleotide substitution rate by more than 100-fold and greatly increased the GC content. Here we study the rates of nucleotide substitution in eight introns of the human and great ape XG gene, which spans the boundary between the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) and the X-specific region. Contrary to what is expected under the above hypothesis, our sequence data from humans and great apes reveal that the PAR1 introns of XG have actually evolved slightly slower than X-specific introns. Only when a New World monkey was compared with hominoids were the rates slightly increased in the PAR1 introns. In terms of base composition, although the intergenic regions of the human PAR1 show a significant increase of G and C nucleotides, the base composition of the surveyed PAR1 introns is similar to that of the X-specific introns. Direct and indirect evidence indicates that the recombination rate is, indeed, much higher in PAR1 introns than in X-specific introns, and that the present PAB has persisted since the common ancestor of hominoids. Therefore, the mutagenic effect of recombination is far weaker than previously proposed, at least in hominoid PABs."
"Sequence, evolution and ligand binding properties of mammalian Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines","['Tournamille, C', 'Blancher, A', 'Le van Kim, C', 'Gane, P', 'Apoil, PA', 'Nakamoto, W', 'Cartron, JP', 'Colin, Y']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s00251-003-0633-2,JAN 2004,33,"The Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokine, DARC, acts as a widely expressed promiscuous chemokine receptor and as the erythrocyte receptor for Plasmodium vivax. To gain insight into the evolution and structure/function relations of DARC, we analyzed the binding of anti-human Fy monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and human chemokines to red blood cells (RBCs) from 11 nonhuman primates and two nonprimate mammals, and we elucidated the structures of the DARC genes from gorilla, gibbon, baboon, marmoset, tamarin, night monkey and cattle. CXCL-8 and CCL-5 chemokine binding analysis indicated that the promiscuous binding profile characteristic of DARC is conserved across species. Among three mAbs that detected the Fy6 epitope by flow cytometric analysis of human and chimpanzee RBCs, only one reacted with night monkey and squirrel monkey. Only chimpanzee RBCs bound a significant amount of the anti-Fy3 mAb. Fy3 was also poorly detected on RBCs from gorilla, baboon and rhesus monkey, but not from new world monkeys. Alignment of DARC homologous sequences allowed us to construct a phylogenetic tree in which all branchings were in accordance with current knowledge of primate phylogeny. Although DARC was expected to be under strong internal and external selection pressure, in order to maintain chemokine binding and avoid Plasmodium vivax binding, respectively, our present study did not provide arguments in favor of a selection pressure on the extracellular domains involved in ligand specificity. The amino acid variability of DARC-like polypeptides was found to be well correlated with the hydrophylicity indexes, with the highest divergence on the amino-terminal extracellular domain. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences highlighted the conservation of some amino acid residues, which should prove to be critical for the structural and functional properties of DARC."
Looking for Hazel: The Politics of Black Feminist Criticism,['안지현'],In/Outside: English Studies in Korea,NA,2004,0,"The central question raised in the infamous debate between Henry Louis Gates Jr./Houston Baker Jr. and Joyce A. Joyce is, which critical methodology ensures a progressive black politics in contemporary America. What is striking about this debate is that first, black feminists, including Joyce, are vehemently attacked as “essentialists” and secondly, adherence to “essentialism” is assumed to be politically conservative, already having lost its political efficacy. In this paper, I argue that what is problematic about such a charge is that for black women who still must grapple with the project of constructing and affirming “black women’s identity” the essentialist approach still holds some political validity. The second part of this paper examines this thorny theoretical issue by reading “Gorilla, My Love” as a text which explores the way in which the shifting identities of Hazel are mediated in both black and white societies. The text reveals that the “dozens,” symbolic of “blackness,” have already been appropriated by whites, and instead, Hazel’s unique brand of feisty no-nonsense northern, urban language voicing her resistance, is presented as an alterna- tive. However, the text also shows that there are limitations to the subversive power of language. In this way, “Gorilla, My Love” sends a warning signal against black critics who believe that their cutting-edge critical methodologies promote progressive black politics."
To move or not to move How apes adjust to the attentional state of others,"['Liebal, K', 'Pika, S', 'Call, J', 'Tomasello, M']",INTERACTION STUDIES,10.1075/is.5.2.03lie,2004,59,"A previous observational study suggested that when faced with a partner with its back turned, chimpanzees tend to move around to the front of a non-attending partner and then gesture-rather than gesturing once to attract attention and then again to convey a specific intent. We investigated this preference experimentally by presenting six orangutans, five gorillas, nine chimpanzees, and four bonobos with a food begging situation in which we varied the body orientation of an experimenter (E) with respect to the subject (front vs. back) and the location of the food (in front or behind E). These manipulations allowed us to measure whether subjects preferred to move around to face E or to use signals to attract her attention before they begged for food. Results showed that all species moved around to face E and then produced visual gestures, instead of using tactile/auditory gestures behind E to call her attention. Species differences were apparent particularly when the food and E were in different locations. Unlike gorillas and orangutans, chimpanzees and bonobos (from genus Pan) produced their gestures in front of E in all conditions, including that in which subjects had to leave the food behind to communicate with her. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of the evolution of social cognition in great apes."
A case study of primiparous maternal and infant gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) behavior.,"['Crosby, Jennie Y', 'Lukas, Kristen E']",Journal of applied animal welfare science : JAAWS,10.1207/s15327604jaws0703_1,2004,1,"A primiparous mother and her infant were subjects of a longitudinal behavioral study at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, Illinois. From November 1998 to November 1999, we collected a total of 100 hr of focal nonhuman animal instantaneous point sampling and all occurrence data on the mother and her infant. After 8 months, we introduced the 4-member focal group to an 8-member gorilla group, thus providing an opportunity to study the effect of the introduction on mother-infant behavior. Overall, time the pair spent physically apart was notably high with contact and proximate scores steadily decreasing over time. The infant was largely responsible for maintaining social proximity, rarely leaving the mother and frequently approaching her. In contrast, the mother left the infant frequently and approached the infant minimally. Maternal affiliative and nonaffiliative behaviors fluctuated throughout the study. Over time, both decreased. Despite a precarious maternal relationship, infant developmental trends were typical for captive gorillas. The results of this study suggest that allowing flexibility in judging maternal conduct can be of benefit to successful gorilla husbandry."
Simian T cell leukaemia virus type I subtype B in a wild-caught gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes vellerosus) from Cameroon,"['Nerrienet, E', 'Meertens, L', 'Kfutwah, A', 'Foupouapouognigni, Y', 'Ayouba, A', 'Gessain, A']",JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY,10.1099/vir.0.19314-0,JAN 2004,18,"A serological survey for human T cell leukaemia virus (HTLV)/simian T cell leukaemia virus (STLV) antibodies was performed in 61 wild-caught African apes, including five gorillas and 56 chimpanzees originating from south Cameroon. Two young animals, a gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes vellerosus), exhibited a pattern of complete HTLV-1 seroreactivity. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses using the complete LTR (750 bp) and a 522 bp fragment of the env gene indicated the existence of two novel STLV-1 strains, both of which belonged to HTLV-1/STLV-1 molecular clade subtype B, specific to central Africa. These first STLV-1 strains to be characterized in gorilla and chimpanzee were closely related to each other as well as to several HTLV-1 strains originating from inhabitants of south Cameroon, including pygmies. Such findings reinforce the hypothesis of interspecies; transmission of STLV-1 to humans, leading to the present day distribution of HTLV-1 in central African inhabitants."
Domain shuffling has been the main mechanism forming new hominoid killer cell Ig-like receptors,"['Rajalingam, R', 'Parham, P', 'Abi-Rached, L']",JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY,NA,JAN 1 2004,85,"The killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) gene family encodes MHC class I-specific receptors, which regulate NK cell responses and are also expressed on subpopulations of T cells. KIR haplotypes vary in gene content, which, in combination with allelic polymorphism, extensively diversifies the KIR genotype both within and between human populations. Species comparison indicates that formation of new KIR genes and loss of old ones are frequent events, so that few genes are conserved even between closely related species. In this regard, the hominoids define a time frame that is particularly informative for understanding the processes of KIR evolution and its potential impact on killer cell biology. KIR cDNA were characterized from PBMC of three gorillas, and genomic DNA were characterized for six additional individuals. Eleven gorilla KIR genes were defined. With attainment of these data, a set of 75 KIR sequences representing five hominoid species was assembled, which also included rhesus monkey, cattle, and rodent KIR. Searching this data set for recombination events, and phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian methods, demonstrated that new KIR were usually the result of recombination between loci in which complete protein domains were shuffled. Further phylogenetic analysis of the KIR sequences after removal of confounding recombined segments showed that only two KIR genes, KIR2DL4 and KIR2DL5, have been preserved throughout hominoid evolution, and one of them, KIR2DL4, is also common to rhesus monkey and hominoids. Other KIR genes represent recombinant forms present in a minority of species, often only one, as exemplified by 8 of the 11 gorilla KIR genes."
Genetic variability and evolution of two pharmacologically important classes of genes,"['Pungliya, MS', 'Salisbury, BA', 'Nandabalan, K', 'Stephens, JC']",PHARMACOGENOMICS,10.1517/phgs.5.1.115.25684,JAN 2004,5,"We have studied the human genetic variability of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in two pharmaceutically important classes of genes that might be expected to experience different evolutionary pressures: antigen presentation and processing (APP) and nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) genes. We compared the variation pattern in these two classes of genes with 5119 reference (REF) genes. We assessed this variability by sequencing and discovering SNPs in 5'-upstream, 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR), exon, intron, 3'UTR and 3'-downstream regions of all these genes in 79 unrelated humans from diverse ethnic backgrounds, one chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and a gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). SNP density and nucleotide diversity were higher in the APP genes than the REF genes. Relative to the REF genes, APP SNP density was significantly higher in the coding and 3'UTR regions. Higher variation in the coding region of the APP genes was due specifically to having more non-synonymous changes, which suggests that natural selection may be acting to promote change or diversity in these proteins. In contrast, the NHR genes showed lower SNP density and diversity relative to REF genes. The NHR genes consistently showed lower nucleotide diversity in ail the genomic regions except in the 3'-downstream region. SNP frequency data on the non-synonymous SNPs also suggested that the coding region in the NHR genes is conserved to a higher degree than the coding region in the REF genes. Significantly lower SNP density was observed in the 5'-upstream and 5'UTR regions of the NHR genes, perhaps reflecting selective conservation of these regions. Heterozygosity in the APP genes was significantly higher than in the NHR genes in each of the three species tested. Moreover, between species there were more fixed differences in the APP genes than in the NHR genes. Substantial variability exists in these two classes of genes. It is important to consider this interindividual variability pattern while developing drugs that act on such targets."

We performed a comprehensive genome-wide search for novel SULT genes using two different but complementary approaches, and developed a novel graphical display to aid in the annotation of the hits. Seven novel human SULT genes were identified, five of which were predicted to be pseudogenes, including two processed pseudogenes and three pseudogenes that contained introns. Those five pseudogenes represent the first unambiguous SULT pseudogenes described in any species. Expression-profiling studies were conducted for one novel gene, SULT6B1, and a series of alternatively spliced transcripts were identified in the human testis. SULT6B1 was also present in chimpanzee and gorilla, differing at only seven encoded amino-acid residues among the three species. The results of these database mining studies will aid in studies of the regulation of these SULT genes, provide insights into the evolution of this gene family in humans, and serve as a starting point for comparative genomic studies of SULT genes."
Survey of gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in Southwestern Cameroon,"['Matthews, A', 'Matthews, A']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-003-0058-4,JAN 2004,32,"A study on the distribution and population density of the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla g. gorilla) and the central chimpanzee (Pan t. troglodytes) was undertaken between December 1997 and August 2000 in the Campo and Ma'an Forests in southwestern Cameroon. The aim of this survey was to estimate the densities of the apes in different parts of the area, to assess the importance of the region for the conservation of these endangered species and to determine the influence of human activities such as logging and hunting. The survey was based on night nest counts on a total of 665.5 km of line transects. The overall density in the Campo Forest was estimated at 0.2 gorillas/km(2) and at 0.63-0.78 chimpanzees/km(2). The overall density of chimpanzees in the Ma'an Forest was estimated at 0.8-1 individuals/km(2). Gorilla density in this area was too low to allow an estimation. The highest gorilla nest density was found in secondary forest. The gorilla density in unlogged forest was significantly lower. Chimpanzees showed a clear preference for less disturbed areas. In unlogged forest, old secondary forests (logging more than 23 years ago) and areas of recent logging with large remaining patches of primary forest, significantly higher densities were calculated than inside the more heavily exploited logging concession. In areas with both logging and high hunting pressure both species were rare or even absent. The Campo Ma'an area is considered a very important area for the conservation of gorillas and chimpanzees. Conservation measures are urgently required to reduce the impact of logging and hunting. The creation of the Campo Ma'an National Park in January 2000 is an important measure to preserve the unique biodiversity in this so far hardly protected area."

The quality of infant care by the young adult daughter clearly improved during the first 4 days after birth, and this improvement was at least partly based on her mother's encouragement. Thus, the mother's activities can be considered scaffolding for her daughter with regard to maternal infant care."

Factors influencing the maintenance of all-male in captivity formation and gorilla groups,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Lukas, KE', 'Kuhar, CW', 'Maple, TL']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20005,2004,27,"The social housing of males is of particular importance for captive managers of polygynous species. In this work, we highlight nine areas we believe are important to the successful formation and maintenance of all-male gorilla groups. Although more data are still needed to complete our understanding of these groups, the general picture that emerges is that all-male groups can be a functional social unit for male gorillas, the longevity of which might be improved by careful planning. It appears that the best time to form all-male groups is when the animals are still immature, as males in this age class have been observed to form some of the most stable groups. Efforts should be made to diversify the groups in terms of rearing history, particularly with respect to hand-reared males, and to limit the amount of hand rearing experienced by males. Groups probably should contain no more than three or four adult males. Exhibits should be designed to provide visual barriers, refuges for subordinate animals, the means to separate individuals, and possibly the means to isolate all-male groups from mixed-sex groups. Additionally, because it is likely that some males will have to be removed from all-male groups, zoos need to design facilities that provide state-of-the-art housing for solitary individuals. It is hoped that by identifying bachelor males early in life and establishing cooperative management plans across institutions, zoos will be able to provide beneficial, long-term social situations for all male gorillas in captivity.

Managers will often attempt to leave infants with their mothers as long as possible in an effort to provide the infant with natural maternal care, as well as give the mother some maternal experience. However if the mother is not capable of properly rearing the infant, this process can be dangerous to the infant. Objective criteria to measure and predict a mother's abilities would be useful. Few studies have examined the behavior patterns of successful and unsuccessful chimpanzee mothers, and the findings of those studies were descriptive, with little or no quantitative results. In the current study, 23 primiparous chimpanzees were examined for differences in behavior between successful and unsuccessful mothers over a period of several weeks postpartum. Mothers were classified as unsuccessful if their infants required nursery-rearing due to inadequate maternal behavior. Only 7 of the 23 mothers in this sample were classified as unsuccessful. Successful mothers engaged in appropriate carrying behaviors more often than unsuccessful mothers. Additionally, successful mothers engaged in fewer inappropriate carrying behaviors and infant avoidance behaviors. However, successful mothers did engage in these behaviors, albeit less frequently, indicating that the presence of these behaviors alone is not indicative of inadequate maternal ability. Maternal behaviors, infant behaviors, and mother-infant interactions showed no change in frequency over a period of 3 weeks for either successful or unsuccessful mothers, with the exception of infant crying. Infants of successful mothers cried less frequently over time, indicating that their mothers may have been learning how to meet the needs of their infants over the course of time. These results provide some of the first empirical data on the behavior patterns of successful and unsuccessful primiparous chimpanzees. This information can be used to aid colony managers in assessing the maternal ability of primiparous chimpanzees. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Noting that infants come to exhibit many emotions, he also observed that at first their repertoire of expression is highly restricted. Today, considerable controversy exists regarding the question of whether infants experience and express discrete emotions. According to one position, discrete emotions emerge during infancy along with their prototypic facial expressions. These expressions closely resemble adult emotional expressions and are invariantly concordant with their corresponding emotions. In contrast, we propose that the relation between expression and emotion during infancy is more complex. Some infant emotions and emotional expressions may not be invariantly concordant. Furthermore, infant emotional expressions may be less differentiated than previously proposed. Together with past developmental studies, recent cross-cultural research supports this view and suggests that negative emotional expression in particular is only partly differentiated towards the end of the first year."

Doctors, as well as sensation seekers, were very keen to examine her.

"Ranging patterns of a western gorilla group during habituation to humans in the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African Republic","['Cipolletta, C']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/B:IJOP.0000005988.52177.45,DEC 2003,29,"The ranging patterns of western gorillas have been described in relation to their more frugivorous diet as compared to mountain gorillas. However, the lack of data from habituated groups prevents a full understanding of their ranging behavior and its implications for western gorilla social behavior. Unhabituated gorillas often flee from approaching researchers, possibly resulting in longer daily ranges and home range expansions and/or shifts. I report on the influence of habituation on the ranging patterns of a western gorilla group. I analyzed progress in habituation through changes in gorilla reactions, displayed upon detecting the observers. I measured daily path length and home range while following the group's trails and monitored diet via fecal analyses and direct observations. During the study period, habituation progressed and the gorillas increasingly ignored the arrival of observers. As a result, daily path lengths were longer during the early stages of habituation, when the gorillas were avoiding observers. There was no range expansion or shift, though the measure is more difficult to investigate, being subject to error due to variation in sample size. We recorded seasonal changes in the consumption of fruit by gorillas, but no direct effect on ranging patterns is detectable with the data available, which is likely a consequence of the combined effect of habituation and seasonality on group movements. The findings are not only important for understanding the extent of human influence while conducting research on wild gorillas but also suggest the need for caution when interpreting results from non-habituated gorillas."

Occurrence of hepatitis viruses in wild-born non-human primates: a 3 year (1998-2001) epidemiological survey in Gabon,"['Makuwa, M', 'Souquiere, S', 'Telfer, P', 'Leroy, E', 'Bourry, O', 'Rouquet, P', 'Clifford, S', 'Wickings, EJ', 'Roques, P', 'Simon, F']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1046/j.1600-0684.2003.00042.x,DEC 2003,19,"Hepatitis B and C infections are endemic in human population in central Africa, particularly in Gabon. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and eventual occurrence of hepatitis C virus (HBC)-related strains in a variety of wild-born non-human primates living in Gabon and Congo. Plasma samples were screened for HBV and HCV markers. A non-invasive method of DNA extraction from faeces followed by specific HBV-DNA amplification was developed to study this infection in wild troops of chimpanzees and gorillas. No HCV infection in non-human primates, wild-born or captive, was detected among 596 samples tested. NO HBV infection could be detected in samples tested and obtained from Cercopithecidae. In contrast, 14.7 and 42.2% of wild-born chimpanzees in Gabon and Congo were infected with HBV or had evidence of past HBV infection. At Centre International de Recherches Medicales (CIRMF) Primate Centre, 32.1% of chimpanzees and gorillas were HBV positive or had evidence of past infection. In the cases with past infection, 5.9% wild-born and 8.3% at CIRMF harboured HBV-DNA despite the presence of neutralizing HbsAb. Together with previous findings, we confirm the high HBV prevalence not only in humans but also in chimpanzees and gorillas in Gabon and Congo."
Lineage-specific homogenization of the polyubiquitin gene among human and great apes,"['Tachikui, H', 'Saitou, N', 'Nakajima, T', 'Hayasaka, I', 'Ishida, T', 'Inoue, I']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-003-2532-4,DEC 2003,6,"Ubiquitin is a highly conserved protein, and is encoded by a multigene family among eukaryote species. The polyubiquitin genes, UbB and UbC, comprise tandem multiple ubiquitin coding units without a spacer region or intron. We determined nucleotide sequences for the UbB and UbC of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. The ubiquitin repeat number of UbB was constant (3) in human and great apes, while that of UbC varied: 6 to 11 for human. 10 to 12 for chimpanzee, 8 for gorilla, and 10 for orangutan. The heterogeneity of the repeat number within closely related hominoid species suggests that a lineage-specific unequal crossover and/or gene duplication occurred. A marked homogenization of UbC occurred in gorilla with a low level of synonymous difference (p,). The homogenization of UbC also occurred in chimpanzee and less strikingly in human. The first and last ubiquitin coding units of UbC were clustered independently between species, and less affected by homogenization during the hominoid evolution. Therefore, the homogenization of ubiquitin coding units is likely due to an unequal crossing-over inside the ubiquitin units. The lineage-specific homogenization of UbC among closely related species suggests that concerted evolution has a key role in the short-term evolution of UbC."

The choice of post-conflict interactions in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Wittig, RM', 'Boesch, C']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/156853903771980701,NOV-DEC 2003,50,"Some costs of conflicts remain after an aggressive interaction has been terminated. Post-conflict management in social living animals can reduce those costs by means of a variety of interactions implemented after aggression (e.g. reconciliation, consolation, redirected aggression). Each post-conflict interaction (PCI) provides different advantages and disadvantages, although the functions may sometimes overlap. Individuals can therefore choose a PCI to achieve the most favourable outcome within a given conflict situation. We examined 876 dyadic aggressive interactions among 18 wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) of both sexes in the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. We investigated which conflict-condition led to which type of PCI and related the choice of PCI to its advantages and disadvantages. Tai chimpanzees used reconciliation to resolve conflicts among high value partners and when approaching the former opponent was unlikely to entail further aggression. Consolation seemed to substitute for reconciliation, when were opponents low value partners or approaching the former opponent was too risky, such as when further aggression was likely. Tai chimpanzees renewed aggression after undecided conflicts and when losers were unexpected. They used redirected aggression after long conflicts, possibly because friendly PCIs were likely to fail. However, Tai chimpanzees continued with business as usual when conflicts were very short, and they avoided further interactions when the accessibility of the resource was unlimited. Tai chimpanzees appeared to follow a clear-cut evaluation process as they seemed to weigh advantages against disadvantages for the appropriate choice of PCI."

Is somnambulism a distinct disorder of humans and not seen in non-human primates?,"['Kantha, SS']",MEDICAL HYPOTHESES,10.1016/S0306-9877(03)00206-8,NOV-DEC 2003,1,"Though somnambulism (sleepwalking) is a well-recognized sleep disorder in humans, a biomedical literature search in Medline and Primate Literature bibliographic databases showed no publications on sleepwalking in non-human primates. From this finding, two inferences can be made. First is that somnambulism may be present in non-human primates; but due to limitations in expertise and methodological resources as well as narrow focus of research interest, until now researchers have not detected it in wild and/or captive conditions. Second, somnambulism does not exist in non-human primates including apes (chimpanzee, gorilla, orang-utan and gibbon); and thus, it is a unique behavioral disorder present only in humans. It is premature to conclude which of these two inferences is correct. In Jane Goodall's view, sleepwalking behavior is absent in chimpanzees. If further field observations can confirm Goodall's assertion that somnambulism is indeed absent in chimpanzees, it will be of evolutionary and medical interest to know why this parasomnic behavior became established in humans during the past 5.5 million years or so.

Rapidly evolving genes in human. I. The glycophorins and their possible role in evading malaria parasites,"['Wang, HY', 'Tang, H', 'Shen, CKJ', 'Wu, CI']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msg185,NOV 2003,56,"In an attempt to identify all fast-evolving genes between human and other primates, we found three glycophorins, GPA, GPB, and GPE, to have the highest rate of nonsynonymous substitutions among the 280 genes surveyed. The K-a/K-s ratios are generally greater than 3 for GPA, GPB, and GPE in human, chimpanzee, and gorilla, indicating positive selection. The uniformly high substitution rate across loci can be explained by the frequent sequence exchanges among genes. GPA is the receptor for the binding ligand EBA-175 of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. The levels of nonsynonymous divergence and polymorphism of EBA-175 are also the highest in the genome of P. falciparum. We hypothesize that GPA has been evolving rapidly to evade malaria parasites. Both the high rate of nonsynonymous substitutions and the frequent interlocus conversions may be means of evasion. The support for the evasion hypothesis is still indirect, but, unlike other hypotheses, it can be tested specifically and systematically."
Evolution of primate theta-defensins: a serpentine path to a sweet tooth,"['Nguyen, TX', 'Cole, AM', 'Lehrer, RI']",PEPTIDES,10.1016/j.peptides.2003.07.023,NOV 2003,111,"Retrocyclins (ancestral human theta-defensins) are cyclic antimicrobial octadecapeptides that interfere with viral uptake and protect human cells from infection by T- and M-tropic strains of HIV-1 in vitro. As are other theta-defensins, retrocyclins are lectins that bind gp120, CD4, and galactosylceramide-all of which are implicated in HIV-1 uptake. Although theta-defensin mRNA transcripts are present in human bone marrow, spleen, thymus, testis, and skeletal muscle, a premature stop codon aborts their translation. We found six theta-defensin (DEFT) genes in the human genome; five on chromosome 8p23 and one on chromosome 1. All six of these pseudogenes, as well as:their homologues in chimpanzees and gorillas, contained the same premature stop codon mutation. Whereas we found intact DEFT genes in DNA from several Old World Monkeys, Hylobates syndactylus (a lesser ape) and orangutans, no homologues were present in DNA from six New World Monkeys and five prosimians. We conclude that DEFT genes and theta-defensins arose in Old World Monkeys by mutation of a pre-existing alpha-defensin gene. Although intact DEFT genes survive in some nonhuman primates, our hominid ancestors lost their ability to produce theta-defensins after the orangutan and hominid lineages diverged. It is possible (but may be difficult to prove) that this mutation rendered our species more susceptible to infection by HIV-1. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Myotonic dystrophy type 2: Human founder haplotype and evolutionary conservation of the repeat tract,"['Liquori, CL', 'Ikeda, Y', 'Weatherspoon, M', 'Ricker, K', 'Schoser, BGH', 'Dalton, JC', 'Day, JW', 'Ranum, LPW']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS,10.1086/378720,OCT 2003,42,"Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, can be caused by a mutation on either chromosome 19 (DM1) or 3 (DM2). In 2001, we demonstrated that DM2 is caused by a CCTG expansion in intron 1 of the zinc finger protein 9 (ZNF9) gene. To investigate the ancestral origins of the DM2 expansion, we compared haplotypes for 71 families with genetically confirmed DM2, using 19 short tandem repeat markers that we developed that flank the repeat tract. All of the families are white, with the majority of Northern European/ German descent and a single family from Afghanistan. Several conserved haplotypes spanning >700 kb appear to converge into a single haplotype near the repeat tract. The common interval that is shared by all families with DM2 immediately flanks the repeat, extending up to 216 kb telomeric and 119 kb centromeric of the CCTG expansion. The DM2 repeat tract contains the complex repeat motif (TG)(n)(TCTG)(n)(CCTG)(n). The CCTG portion of the repeat tract is interrupted on normal alleles, but, as in other expansion disorders, these interruptions are lost on affected alleles. We examined haplotypes of 228 control chromosomes and identified a potential premutation allele with an uninterrupted (CCTG)(20) on a haplotype that was identical to the most common affected haplotype. Our data suggest that the predominant Northern European ancestry of families with DM2 resulted from a common founder and that the loss of interruptions within the CCTG portion of the repeat tract may predispose alleles to further expansion. To gain insight into possible function of the repeat tract, we looked for evolutionary conservation. The complex repeat motif and flanking sequences within intron 1 are conserved among human, chimpanzee, gorilla, mouse, and rat, suggesting a conserved biological function."
Functional capabilities of modern and fossil hominid hands: Three-dimensional analysis of trapezia,"['Tocheri, MW', 'Marzke, MW', 'Liu, D', 'Bae, M', 'Jones, GP', 'Williams, RC', 'Razdan, A', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10235,OCT 2003,35,"Three-dimensional (3D) trapezium models from Homo sapiens, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Australopithecus afarensis (A.L.333-80), and Homo habilis (O.H.7-NNQ) were acquired through laser digitizing. Least-square planes were generated for each articular surface, and the angles between the planes were compared. Each extant species displays an overall pattern that distinguishes it from the others. The observed angles in G. gorilla and P. troglodytes are more similar to one other than either is to H. sapiens. Our results, obtained from using new 3D modeling and analytical tools, raise interesting questions about the functional capabilities of the fossil trapezia. Multivariate statistical analyses indicate that A.L.333-80 is morphologically more similar to that of modern humans, whereas the O.H.7 trapezium is more similar to that of the gorilla. Significant differences between A.L.333-80 and the extant species occur, but some similarities to humans suggest the ability to form the distinctively human forceful pad-to-side and three-jaw chuck grips. Some key morphological differences from humans highlighted and quantified by our research suggest limitations in the functional capabilities of the O.H.7 trapezium, particularly in those that facilitate pronation at the base of the second metacarpal. If the O.H.7 trapezium represents part of the hand responsible for manufacturing and using the stone tools found at Olduvai, our results suggest that the hand manipulated the stones in a way for which we have no modern analog. Alternative considerations are that the O.H.7 trapezium is not representative of other trapezia from its species (i.e., N = 1), or that it represents another primate or hominid species.

Proximity patterns of female western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) during the six months after parturition,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Hoff, MP', 'Maple, TL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.10110,OCT 2003,14,"Studies of wild mountain gorillas have demonstrated strong preferences among new mothers for the silverback. Protection against infanticide has been theorized to be the primary cause for this attraction. We examined social partner preferences in captive western lowland mothers during the 6 mo after parturition and found that juveniles and females were the primary members of the new mothers' social network. Mothers spent significantly more time in close proximity with both of these subgroups than with the silverback. Proximity patterns changed over time: new mothers spent more time near females in the month after parturition than in the month prior to parturition, and spatial proximity increased again in months 2-6 postparturition. These findings differ from those reported for wild mountain gorillas, which may reflect the lack of infanticide risk in captivity. Given current hypotheses that infanticide may be a limited in western lowland gorillas, the social partner preferences observed here may be indicative of patterns in wild populations.

This newly discovered gorilla population is geographically intermediate between the 2 extant populations of western gorillas: Gorilla gorilla gorilla, the most populous gorilla subspecies living in Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Congo-Brazzaville, Central African Republic and Cameroon to the south of the Sanaga River, and G. g. diehli or the Cross River gorilla, a small population of ca. 250 individuals on the Cameroon-Nigeria border. It is not possible to assign the new gorilla population to either subspecies on the basis of measurements of the single male cranium. Genetic analyses of freshly shed hairs, collected from gorilla nests, may help to resolve the taxonomic status of the Ebo gorillas."

Here we describe a simple but effective approach, termed whole-genome sampling analysis (WGSA), for genotyping thousands of SNPs simultaneously in a complex DNA sample without locus-specific primers or automation. Our method amplifies highly reproducible fractions of the genome across multiple DNA samples and calls genotypes at >99% accuracy. We rapidly genotyped 14,548 SNPs in three different human populations and identified a subset of them with significant allele frequency differences between groups. We also determined the ancestral allele for 8,386 SNPs by genotyping chimpanzee and gorilla DNA. WGSA is highly scaleable and enables the creation of ultrahigh density SNP maps for use in genetic studies."
"Ebola and the decline of gorilla Gorilla gorilla and chimpanzee Pan troglodytes populations in Minkebe Forest, north-eastern Gabon","['Huijbregts, B', 'De Wachter, P', 'Obiang, LSN', 'Akou, ME']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605303000802,OCT 2003,33,"During 1998-2000 extremely low densities of gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla and chimpanzees Pan troglodytes troglodytes were found in the Minkebe Forest block in north-eastern Gabon. When compared with data collected before 1994, these data suggest a catastrophic decline in ape populations in the area. We believe that this decline was caused by a disease epidemic. The period of decline corresponds with the Ebola outbreaks of 1994 and 1996 that occurred in the human population in the same area. Deaths of gorillas and chimpanzees were associated with both Ebola outbreaks. Data from nearby sites indicate that the epidemic was limited to the Minkebe Forest. Occurrence of such epidemic die-offs should be taken into account in conservation strategies for the long-term survival of ape populations. At the time of writing, an Ebola epidemic among humans in the Zadie Department east of Minkebe Forest has resulted in 53 deaths. In the neighbouring Republic of Congo, authorities have reported 43 deaths and at least 12 other cases of Ebola. These epidemics are believed to be linked to the handling and eating of dead apes."
Intra-specific variation in social organization of gorillas: implications for their social evolution,"['Yamagiwa, J', 'Kahekwa, J', 'Basabose, AK']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-003-0049-5,OCT 2003,33,"We analysed intra-specific variation in the social organization of gorillas and ecological and social factors influencing them, based on recent data on diet, day journey length, home range size, group size and proportion of multi-male groups in three subspecies [western lowland gorillas (WLG); eastern lowland gorillas (ELG); mountain gorillas (MG)]. Median group size was similar across subspecies and across habitats, but the extraordinarily large group including > 30 gorillas was only found in habitat with dense terrestrial herbaceous vegetation. Within-group competition may determine the upper limit of group size in frugivorous WLGs and ELGs in lowland habitats with scarce undergrowth. A frugivorous diet may be a causal factor of subgrouping in multi-male groups of WLGs and ELGs, while a folivorous diet may prevent subgrouping in multi-male groups of MGs. Social factors, rather than ecological factors, may play an important role in the formation of multi-male groups and their cohesiveness in MGs. High gregariousness of female gorillas and their prolonged association with a protector male are explained by their vulnerability to both infanticide (MGs) and predators (ELGs). Comparison of long-term changes in group composition and individual movements between ELGs in Kahuzi and MGs in the Virungas suggest that the occurrence of infanticide may promote kin-male association within a group. Threat of infanticide may stimulate MG females to transfer into multi-male groups to seek reliable protection and maturing MG males to stay in their natal groups after maturity. By contrast, the absence of infanticide may facilitate ELG females to associate with infants and other females at transfer and ELG males to establish large groups in a short period by taking females from their natal groups, by luring females from neighbouring groups, or by takeover of a widow group after the death of its leading male. These conditions may prevent ELG and WLG maturing males from remaining to reproduce in their natal groups and possibly result in a rare occurrence of multi-male groups in their habitats. Similar reproductive features of MG and ELG females suggest both female strategies have been adaptive in their evolutionary history."
The effects of selective logging on forest structure and tree species composition in a Central African forest: implications for management of conservation areas,"['Hall, JS', 'Harris, DJ', 'Medjibe, V', 'Ashton, PMS']",FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,10.1016/S0378-1127(03)00107-5,SEP 15 2003,68,"The forests of Central Africa enjoy world-wide recognition for their spectacular wildlife and also harbor an abundance of high quality timber. With mismanagement and the conversion of large tracts of West African forest to agricultural production, Central African forests are experiencing increased harvesting pressures. This is particularly true for species of African mahogany (Entandrophragma spp.).

In the tri-national region of Cameroon, Central African Republic, and Republic of Congo, a widely applied version of the Integrated Conservation and Development Model attributes the dual management objectives of biodiversity conservation and timber production to the same zones. Many conservationists working in the region believe that highly selective timber extraction is the best management scenario to meet these objectives. Conventional wisdom holds that if selective logging does not adequately regenerate Entandrophragma spp., loggers will quit the region after having mined the forest.

A comparison between unlogged, 6-month and 18-year post-harvest forest stands indicates lasting effects of highly selective, high grade logging. While there was little difference in tree species composition and diversity between treatments, stem densities of both saplings and trees in unlogged forest were significantly higher than those in forest sampled 18 years after logging. Evidence suggests inadequate recruitment of Entandrophragma cylindricum and E. utile, the principal timber species, to justify continued timber extraction. Data indicate a significant shift in canopy dominance from shade intolerant to shade beating species due to insufficient canopy disturbance. Nevertheless, an abundance of other top quality timber species remains after selective removal of African mahogany and these forests will remain attractive to loggers long after the elimination of Entandrophragma spp. A better approach to manage timber zones for timber production and conservation would be an adaptive management approach based on increased species selection and canopy disturbance. Zones targeting the conservation of closed forest obligate species should not be logged. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
A study of host defence peptide beta-defensin 3 in primates,"['Boniotto, M', 'Antcheva, N', 'Zelezetsky, I', 'Tossi, A', 'Palumbo, V', 'Falzacappa, MVV', 'Sgubin, S', 'Braida, L', 'Amoroso, A', 'Crovella, S']",BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL,10.1042/BJ20030528,SEP 14 2003,54,"We have investigated the molecular evolution of the gene coding for beta-defensin 3 (DEFB103) in 17 primate species including humans. Unlike the DEFB4 genes (coding for beta-defensin 2) [Boniotto, Tossi, Del Pero, Sgubin, Antcheva, Santon and Masters (2003) Genes Immun. 4, 251-257], DEFB103 shows a marked degree of conservation in humans, Great Apes and New and Old World monkeys. Only the Hylobates concolor defensin hcBD3 showed an amino acid variation Arg(17)-->Trp(17) that could have a functional implication, as it disrupts an intramolecular salt bridge with Glu(27), which locally decreases the charge and may favour dimerization in the human congener hBD3. This is thought to involve the formation of an intermolecular salt bridge between Glu(28) and Lys(32) on another monomer [Schibli, Hunter, Aseyev, Starner, Wiencek, McCray, Tack and Vogel (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 8279-8289]. To test the role of dimerization in mediating biological activity, we synthesized hBD3, hcBD3 and an artificial peptide in which the Lys(26)-Glu(27)-Glu(28) stretch was replaced by the equivalent Phe-Thr-Lys stretch from human beta-defensin 1 and we characterized their structure and anti-microbial activity. Although the structuring and dimerization of these peptides were found to differ significantly, this did not appear to affect markedly the anti-microbial potency, the broad spectrum of activity or the insensitivity of the anti-microbial action to the salinity of the medium."

To investigate the distribution of naturally occurring HBV infection in these species and other African Old World monkey species (Cercopithecidae), we screened 137 plasma samples from mainly wild caught animals by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using several of highly conserved primers from the HB surface (HBs) gene. and for HBs antigen (HBsAg) by ELISA. None of the 93 Cercopithecidae screened (6 species) showed PCR or serology evidence for HBV infection; in contrast 2 from 8 chimpanzees and 5 from 22 gibbons were PCR-positive with each set of primers.

Complete genome sequences from each of the positive apes were obtained and compared with all previously published complete and surface gene sequences. This extended phylogenetic analysis indicated that HBV variants from orangutans were interspersed by with HBV variants from southerly distributed gibbon species (H. agilis and H. moloch) occupying overlapping or adjacent habitat ranges with orangutans, in contrast, HBV variants from gibbon species in mainland Asia were phylogenetically distinct. A geographical rather than (sub)species association of HBV would account for the distribution of HBV variants in different subspecies of chimpanzees in Africa, and explain the inlier position of the previously described lowland gorilla sequence in the chimpanzee clade. These new findings have a number of implication for understanding the origins and epidemiology of HBV infection in non-human primates. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Functional significance of cortical bone distribution in anthropoid mandibles: An in vitro assessment of bone strain under combined loads,"['Daegling, DJ', 'Hotzman, JL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10225,SEP 2003,26,"Local variation in cortical bone thickness in the postcanine mandibular corpus appears to be stereotypical among anthropoids. Specifically, at sections under the molars, lingually situated cortical bone is typically thinner than that along the lateral aspect. This pattern applies despite phylogenetic, dietary, and allometric differences among the anthropoids sampled to date. Demes et al. (Food Acquisition and Processing in Primates [1984] New York: Plenum Press, p. 369-390) employed a theoretical analysis of mastication in Gorilla and Homo to argue that this pattern could be explained with reference to biomechanical stresses. Specifically, they proposed that the combined effects of torsion and direct shear on the working-side corpus create a condition in which net stresses and strains are reduced along the lingual cortical plate. Demonstration of this effect would suggest a functional linkage between localized differences in bone mass and strain gradients in the facial skeleton. We conducted an empirical evaluation of the effects of the combined loads of torsion and direct shear in vitro on a sample of formalin-fixed human mandibles. Rosette strain gages were affixed to the lateral and medial aspects of the corpus in each specimen, and surface strains were recorded separately under controlled torsional and occlusal loads, and under simultaneous application of these loads. The hypothesis that lingual strains are reduced under combined twisting and occlusal loads was generally supported; however, we observed reduction in surface strains at some sites along the lateral aspect of the corpus under these combined loads as well. These unexpected findings are attributable to unanticipated loading conditions imposed by occlusal forces, which result from sources of stress in addition to direct shear. These experiments provide provisional support for the hypothesis that superposed sources of bone strain produce large strain gradients between buccal and lingual aspects of the mandibular corpus, and that local variation in bone mass may be associated with these gradients.

Female dispersal and reproductive success in wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Stokes, EJ', 'Parnell, RJ', 'Olejniczak, C']",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,10.1007/s00265-003-0630-3,SEP 2003,93,"This paper presents data on the dispersal patterns and reproductive success of western lowland gorilla females from a long-term study at Mbeli Bai in the Nouabale-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo. We find that female natal and secondary transfer is common. Female immigration rates are negatively related to group size, and emigration rates are positively related to group size, with the net result that larger groups are losing females and smaller groups are gaining females. Furthermore, females transferring between known groups show a preference for significantly smaller groups. However, there is no effect of group size on female reproductive success. Male protection and male quality are considered important in determining female transfer decisions. The case for infanticide is argued and females exhibit strategies that appear to minimise the probability of infanticide following the death of the silverback. Exclusively single-male groups and group formation through female acquisition by solitary males may bias female transfer to lone silverbacks and small groups. The effects of group size on female dispersal and reproductive success are not wholly consistent with an argument for increased foraging costs, and group size effects are more parsimoniously explained by demographic factors. Male protection from intra-group aggression is the most likely factor underlying grouping patterns across gorilla taxa, but differences in population structure and male reproductive strategies may account for inter-specific variation. We stress the need for intra-specific comparisons and more complete data sets on western lowland gorilla feeding behaviour."
Qualitative analysis of constitutive heterochromatin and primate evolution,"['Garcia, F', 'Garcia, M', 'Mora, L', 'Alarcon, L', 'Egozcue, J', 'Ponsa, M']",BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00223.x,SEP 2003,7,"The results of qualitative heterochromatin analysis in 16 species of primates: Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla (F. Hominidae), Hylobates syndactilus (F. Hylobatidae), Macaca fascicularis, M. tibetana, Mandrillus sphinx, M. leucophaeus, Cereopithecus aethiops, C sabaeus and C albogularis (F. Cercopithecidae), Cebus apella, Ateles belzebuth hybridus, Aotus azarae, Saimiri sciureus and Lagothrix lagothricha (F. Cebidae) are presented in this work. We characterized heterochromatin using: (a) in situ digestion with restriction enzymes AluI, HaeIII, RsaI and Sau3A, and (b) chromosome staining with DA/DAPI on unbanded chromosomes, on C-banded chromosomes and on sequentially G-C-banded chromosomes. The aim of this work was to relate the qualitative characteristics of constitutive heterochromatin observed with the cytogenetic evolutive processes in the primate group. Results obtained show that (1) in the family Cercopithecidae, Papionini species do not present chromosomal rearrangements when their karyotypes are compared and the heterochromatin characteristics are uniform, while Cercopithecini species show a high number of chromosomal reorganizations, but they have the same heterochromatic characteristics; (2) the Platyrrhini species analysed show variability in their karyological and heterochromatic characteristics; (3) the Hominoidea present two different situations: Pan, Gorilla and Homo with few chromosomal reorganizations among their karyotypes but with a high variability in their heterochromatin characteristics, and Hylobates with low heterochromatin variability and a highly derived karyotype. Speciation processes related to chromosome changes and heterochromatin variations in different groups of primates are discussed. (C) 2003 The Linnean Society of London."
Assessing landmark influence on shape variation,"['Albert, MH', 'Le, HL', 'Small, CG']",BIOMETRIKA,10.1093/biomet/90.3.669,SEP 2003,2,"Given two sets of landmark data which differ in shape, it is useful to determine the extent to which shape variation can be explained by the perturbations of individual landmarks. We propose a method for assessing this, based on analysing the relative reduction in distance between the shapes that can be achieved by varying the location of a single landmark. This method is applied to a set of landmark data from the cervical vertebrae of two subspecies of gorillas."
Unusual extended fibular origin of the human soleus muscle: Possible morpho-physiologic significance based on comparative anatomy,"['Barberini, F', 'Bucciarelli-Ducci, C', 'Zani, A', 'Cerasoli, D']",CLINICAL ANATOMY,10.1002/ca.10171,SEP 2003,5,"bilateral anomalous extended origin of the soleus muscle was observed in a 73-year-old female cadaver. It arose from the head, neck, and proximal two-thirds of the medial crest of the fibula and ran through the posterior intermuscular septum of the leg, from the lateral border of the fibula. The soleus muscle formed the vault of a muscular tunnel, overcoming the deep flexor muscles of the leg that was about 15 cm in length and directed inferiorly and laterally. The extended fibular origin delimited a blind recess lateral to the muscular tunnel and parallel to the posterior surface of the fibula. This recess measured 6.5 cm in length and extended 3.5 cm above the inferior opening of the muscular tunnel; the superior portion of the flexor hallucis longus was housed within it between the portions of the extended origin from the medial crest of the fibula and posterior intermuscular septum. The neurovascular bundle of the posterior leg coursed in the muscular tunnel. The tibial origin and calcaneal insertion of the soleus muscle were normal. Phylogenetic studies of the muscles of the lower limbs in mammals indicate that the fibular origin of soleus is more constant than the tibial origin and, in primates, the fibular origin is the only one observed in most monkeys. The case reported might be considered a conspicuous enlargement of the fibular origin observed in primates. This large fibular origin of the soleus muscle may prove to be a difficulty during surgery when accessing the proximal two-thirds of the fibula for ligation of the peroneal artery.

The task required that the apes remove food from the inside edges of a symmetrical polyvinyl chloride pipe presented to them in their home cages. The results indicate significant species differences with chimpanzees showing population-level right-handedness and orangutans showing population-level left-handedness. The gorillas showed a nonsignificant trend toward right-handedness. The results are discussed in terms of possible ecological or biomechanical factors that may influence hand preferences in different ape species."

The Y-PLEX(TM)5 enables simultaneous amplification of five polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) loci residing on the Y-chromosome, which are DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS439, DYS438, and DYS392. As little as 0.1 ng of template DNA can be used for analysis. The specificity of the amplification reaction enabled analysis of male DNA in a male: female DNA mixture at a ratio of 1:600. Mean stutter values ranged from 3.60-10.97%. Among the different primates investigated, the DNA from orangutan exhibited amplification at DYS438 locus and from gorilla at DYS439 and DYS438 loci. The DNA from cat, dog, and horse did not yield any amplified product. Studies on development of the genotyping system, generation and description of the allelic ladder, and validation of the multiplex PCR as per the FBI Director's Quality Assurance Standards were carried out. Y-STR allele and haplotype frequencies in two populations were generated. The data indicate that the Y-PLEX(TM)5 genotyping system is sensitive and reliable, and can be used in human forensic and male lineage identification cases."
"Evolution of the hominoid semenogelin genes, the major proteins of ejaculated semen","['Jensen-Seaman, MI', 'Li, WH']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-003-2474x,SEP 2003,52,"The hominoid primates (apes and humans) exhibit remarkable diversity in their social and sexual behavioral systems. This is reflected in many ways in their anatomy and physiology. For example, the testes and seminal vesicles are relatively large in species with high sperm competition like the chimpanzee and small in species with low or no sperm competition like the gorilla. Additionally, the chimpanzee is the only hominoid primate known to produce a firm copulatory plug, which presumably functions in sperm competition by blocking insemination of subsequent males. Here we examine the molecular evolution of the semenogelin genes (SEMG1 and SEMG2), which code for the predominant structural proteins in human semen. High molecular weight complexes of these proteins are responsible for the viscous gelatinous consistency of human semen; their rodent homologs are responsible for the formation of a firm copulatory plug. Chimpanzees have an expanded SEMG1 gene caused by duplications of tandem repeats, each encoding 60 amino acids, resulting in a protein nearly twice as long as that of humans. In contrast, at both SEMG1 and SEMG2 we observed several gorilla haplotypes that contain at least one premature stop codon. We suggest that these structural changes in the semenogelin proteins that have arisen since the human-chimpanzee-gorilla split may be responsible for the physiological differences between these species ejaculated semen that correlate with their sociosexual behavior."
A chemical enucleation method for the transfer of mitochondrial DNA to rho degrees cells,"['Bayona-Bafaluy, MP', 'Manfredi, G', 'Moraes, CT']",NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH,10.1093/nar/gng100,AUG 15 2003,25,"The study of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations has, in most cases, relied on the production of transmitochondrial cybrids. Although the procedure to produce such cybrids is well established, it is laborious and cumbersome. Moreover, the mechanical enucleation procedure is inefficient and different techniques have to be used depending on the adherence properties of the cell. To circumvent these difficulties, we developed a chemical enucleation method that can have wide applicability for the production of transmitochondrial cybrids. The method is based on the use of actinomycin D to render the nuclear genome transcription/replication inactive and unable to recover after treatment. Such treated cells are fused to cells devoid of mitochondrial DNA and selected for the presence of a functional oxidative phosphorylation system. Our results showed that 95% of the clones recovered by this procedure are true transmitochondrial cybrids. This method greatly facilitates the production of transmitochondrial cybrids, thereby increasing the number of mtDNA mutations and the recipient cell types that can be studied by this system."
Sexual dimorphism in Australopithecus afarensis was similar to that of modern humans,"['Reno, PL', 'Meindl, RS', 'McCollum, MA', 'Lovejoy, CO']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1133180100,AUG 5 2003,98,"The substantial fossil record for Australopithecus afarensis includes both an adult partial skeleton [Afar Locality (A.L.) 288-1, ""Lucy""] and a large simultaneous death assemblage (A.L. 333). Here we optimize data derived from both to more accurately estimate skeletal size dimorphism. Postcranial ratios derived from A.L. 288-1 enable a significant increase in sample size compared with previous studies. Extensive simulations using modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas confirm that this technique is accurate and that skeletal size dimorphism in A. afarensis was most similar to that of contemporary Homo sapiens. These data eliminate some apparent discrepancies between the canine and skeletal size dimorphism in hominoids, imply that the species was not characterized by substantial sexual bimaturation, and greatly increase the probability that the reproductive strategy of A. afarensis was principally monogamy."
Mitochondrial DNA sequence from an enigmatic gorilla population (Gorilla gorilla uellensis),"['Hofreiter, M', 'Siedel, H', 'Van Neer, W', 'Vigilant, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10186,AUG 2003,17,"Although today gorillas are found in only two widely separate, discontinuous western and eastern African populations, rumors of the existence of an additional gorilla population in central Africa have inspired recent unsuccessful field expeditions in search of the ''mystery ape"" termed Gorilla gorilla uellensis. Such a gorilla population would have considerable conservation and scientific interest, and would presumably have descended from a population of gorillas that was thought to exist until the end of the 19th century on the Uele River in the current-day Democratic Republic of Congo. However, the sole evidence for the existence of these gorillas is three skulls and one mandible brought to the Royal Museum for Central Africa (Tervuren, Belgium) in 1898. We determined a mitochondrial DNA sequence from one of these specimens and compared it to sequences from other gorillas. Contrary to expectations, the sequence obtained did not exhibit the phylogenetic distinctiveness typical of a representative of a peripheral isolated population. Rather, the results suggest a scenario in which the museum specimens did not originally derive from the northern Congo, but were brought from the area of current distribution of western gorillas to that location; the subsequent discovery and collection of the specimens there gave rise to the false inference of a local gorilla population.

Diurnal patterns of urinary steroid excretion in wild chimpanzees,"['Muller, MN', 'Lipson, SF']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.10103,AUG 2003,28,"Urinary testosterone and cortisol concentrations were quantified in a large number of samples (>500) collected from wild male chimpanzees (n=11) over the course of 1 year. For both steroids, urinary concentrations were higher and more variable in the morning than in the afternoon. Urinary creatinine levels showed no such diurnal pattern. These patterns are consistent with studies of steroid excretion in humans and gorillas. This study emphasizes the importance of considering time of day as a confounding variable in field studies of primate endocrine function. It also suggests that if a small number of samples are to be used to characterize an individual's basal steroid levels, afternoon samples may be preferable because they show less intra-individual variability.

A population threshold for functional polymorphisms,"['Wong, GKS', 'Yang, ZY', 'Passey, DA', 'Kibukawa, M', 'Paddock, M', 'Liu, CR', 'Bolund, L', 'Yu, J']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.1324303,AUG 2003,25,"We sequenced 114 genes (for DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and detoxification) in a mixed human population and observed a sudden increase in the number of functional polymorphisms below a minor allele frequency of similar to6%. Functionality is assessed by considering the ratio in the number of nonsynonymous single nucletide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the number of synonymous or intron SNPs. This ratio is steady from below 1% in frequency-that regime traditionally associated with rare Mendelian diseases-all the way up to about 6% ill frequency, after which it falls precipitously. We consider possible explanations for this threshold effect. There are four candidates as follows: (1) deleterious variants that have yet to be purified from the Population, (2) balancing selection, in which a selective advantage accrues to the heterozygotes, (3) population-specific functional polymorphisms, and (4) adaptive variants that are accumulating in the population as a response to the dramatic environmental changes of the last 7,000similar to17,000 years."
Hypoglossal canal size in living hominoids and the evolution of human speech,"['Jungers, WL', 'Pokempner, AA', 'Kay, RF', 'Cartmill, M']",HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1353/hub.2003.0057,AUG 2003,8,"The relative size of the hypoglossal canal has been proposed as a useful diagnostic tool for the identification of human-like speech capabilities in the hominid fossil record. Relatively large hypoglossal canals (standardized to oral cavity size) were observed in humans and assumed to correspond to relatively large hypoglossal nerves, the cranial nerve that controls motor function of the tongue. It was suggested that the human pattern of tongue motor innervation and associated speech potential are very different from those of African apes and australopithecines; the modem human condition apparently appeared by the time of Middle Pleistocene Homo. A broader interspecific analysis of hypoglossal canal size in primates conducted in 1999 has rejected this diagnostic and inferences based upon it. In an attempt to resolve these differences of opinion, which we believe are based in part on biased size-adjustments and/or unwarranted assumptions, a new data set was collected and analyzed from 298 extant hominoid skulls, including orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, siamang, gibbons, and modem humans. Data on the absolute size of the hypoglossal nerve itself were also gathered from a small sample of humans and chimpanzee cadavers. A scale-free index of relative hypoglossal canal size (RHCS) was computed as 100 x (hypoglossal canal area(0.5)/oral cavity volume(0.333)). No significant sexual dimorphism in RHCS was discovered in any species of living hominoid, but there are significant interspecific differences in both absolute and relative sizes of the hypoglossal canal. In absolute terms, humans possess significantly larger canals than any other species except gorillas, but there is considerable overlap with chimpanzees. Humans are also characterized by large values of RHCS, but gibbons possess an even larger average mean for this index; siamang and bonobos overlap appreciably with humans in RHCS. The value of RHCS in Australopithecus afarensis is well within both human and gibbon ranges, as are the indices computed for selected representatives of fossil Homo. Furthermore, the size of the hypoglossal nerve itself, expressed as the mass of nerve per millimeter of length, does not distinguish chimpanzees from modem humans. We conclude, therefore, that the relative size of the hypoglossal canal is neither a reliable nor sufficient predictor of human-like speech capabilities, and paleoanthropology still lacks a quantifiable, morphological diagnostic for when this capability finally emerged in the human career."
"Polymorphism of human and primate RANTES, CX(3)CR1, CCR2 and CXCR4 genes with regard to HIV/SIV infection","['Puissant, B', 'Abbal, M', 'Blancher, A']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s00251-003-0588-3,AUG 2003,10,"Among genes that influence human susceptibility to HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection or AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) progression, chemokine-receptor and chemokine genes were extensively studied because of their role as HIV co-receptors or co-receptor competitors, respectively. We have studied in non-human primates (chimpanzee, gorilla, gibbon, orang-utan, crab-eating and rhesus macaque, baboon and marmoset) the RANTES, CCR2 and CX(3)CR1 gene sequences in regions surrounding human mutations that were associated with susceptibility to HIV or AIDS progression: RANTES G-403A and C-28G, CCR2 V64I, CX(3)CR1 V249I and CX(3)CR1 T280M. Among these five dimorphisms, only RANTES G-403A is observed in one of the eight primate species studied here (gibbon). This suggests that these mutations appeared recently in humans and probably do not account for variable HIV/SIV disease progression in primates. It is noteworthy that chimpanzees, which are naturally resistant to HIV-1- and HIV-2-induced AIDS, do not have the human mutations associated with delayed disease progression. Inter-species and intra-species polymorphic positions are observed in primates and we discuss the potential impact of these mutations on HIV/SIV disease progression. Particularly, we identified polymorphisms in old-world monkey (OWM) genes, and it could be of great importance to analyse the possible association between these polymorphisms and disease progression in OWM species that are currently used in research for HIV vaccine and therapy."

Bwindi chimpanzees fed heavily on fruits of Ficus sp., which were largely ignored by the gorillas. Bwindi gorilla diet was overall more folivorous than chimpanzee diet, but was markedly more frugivorous than that of gorillas in the nearby Virunga Volcanoes. During 4 mo of the year Bwindi gorilla diet included more food species than that of the chimpanzees. Three factors in particular-seasonal consumption of fibrous foods by gorillas, interspecific differences in preferred fruit species, and meat consumption by chimpanzees contributed to dietary divergence between the two species. When feeding on fruits, gorillas ate Myrianthus holstii more frequently than chimpanzees did, while chimpanzees included more figs in their annual diet. Chimpanzee diet included meat of duikers and monkeys; gorilla frequently consumed decaying wood."
"Reduced polymorphism in the chimpanzee semen coagulating protein, semenogelin I","['Kingan, SB', 'Tatar, M', 'Rand, DM']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-002-2463-0,AUG 2003,48,"The semen of many primate species coagulates into a mating plug believed to prevent the sperm of subsequent mating events from accessing the ova. The texture of the coagulum varies among species: from a semisoft mass in humans to a firm plug in chimpanzees. In humans, a component of the coagulum. semenogelin 1, also inhibits sperm motility. We tested the hypothesis that polymorphism and divergence at semenogelin I differ among hominoid species with different mating systems. Sequence data for the semenogelin I locus were obtained from 12 humans, 10 chimpanzees, 7 gorillas, and 1 bonobo. Mitochondrial D-loop data were collected from a subset of individuals to assess levels of variation at an unlinked locus. HKA tests using D-loop sequence data revealed a significant reduction of polymorphism at semenogelin I in chimpanzees, consistent with predictions of a selective sweep at this locus. This result was supported by independent HKA tests using polymorphism data from a putatively neutral locus from the literature. Humans show a similar trend toward reduced polymorphism, although HKA tests were only marginally significant. Gorilla sequence data show evidence of functional loss at the semenogelin I locus, indicated by stop codons within the putative open reading frame as well as high levels of polymorphism. Elevated K-a/K-s, ratios within the Pan-Homo clade suggest a history of positive selection at semenogelin I. Our results suggest that there is a positive relationship between the intensity of sperm competition in a species and the strength of positive Darwinian selection on the seminal protein semenogelin I."
Increased cranial capacity in hominid evolution and preeclampsia,"['Chaline, J']",JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE IMMUNOLOGY,10.1016/S0165-0378(03)00043-3,AUG 2003,18,"One of the major trends in primate evolution generally and hominid evolution in particular, is cranio-facial contraction accompanied by an increase in cranial capacity. Landmark-based morphometric methods are applied to adult skulls of great apes (Gorilla, Pan), australopithecines (Australopithecus and Paranthropus), and humans (Homo eragster, erectus, neanderthalensis, and sapiens). Morphological changes quantified by vector fields (Procrustes methods) indicate that these skull plans are characterized by distinctive degrees of craniofacial contraction. These suggest the existence of three discrete skull organization plans: ""great ape"", ""australopithecine"" and ""Homo"". This paper focuses on the ""Homo"" skull bauplan and discusses the possible relationships between greatly increased cranial capacity and preeclampsia. The earliest species of the human lineage exhibit less cranio-facial contraction and smaller cranial capacity than Homo neanderthalensis and modern Homo sapiens. Neandertalization introduces a posterior elongation of the skull and leads to a large increase in cranial capacity in the last Neandertals, with values as large as in present-day H. sapiens. Consequently, a new biological hypothesis is proposed to account for the unexplained disappearance of H. neanderthalensis some 30 000 years ago related to the possible appearance of preeclampsia as a factor affecting the survival of the species.

Following the LINEs: An analysis of primate genomic variation at human-specific LINE-1 insertion sites,"['Vincent, BJ', 'Myers, JS', 'Ho, HJ', 'Kilroy, GE', 'Walker, JA', 'Watkins, WS', 'Jorde, LB', 'Batzer, MA']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msg146,AUG 2003,36,"The L1 Ta subfamily of long interspersed elements (LINEs) consists exclusively of human-specific L1 elements. Polymerase chain reaction-based screening in nonhuman primate genomes of the orthologous sites for 249 human L1 Ta. elements resulted in the recovery of various types of sequence variants for approximately 12% of these loci. Sequence analysis was employed to capture the nature of the observed variation and to determine the levels of gene conversion and insertion site homoplasy associated with LINE elements. Half of the orthologous loci differed from the predicted sizes due to localized sequence variants that occurred as a result of common mutational processes in ancestral sequences, often including regions containing simple sequence repeats. Additional sequence variation included genomic deletions that occurred upon L1 insertion, as well as successive mobile element insertions that accumulated within a single locus over evolutionary time. Parallel independent mobile element insertions at orthologous loci in distinct species may introduce homoplasy into retroelement-based phylogenetic and population genetic data. We estimate the overall frequency of parallel independent insertion events at L1 insertion sites in seven different primate species to be very low (0.52%). In addition, no cases of insertion site homoplasy involved the integration of a second L1 element at any of the loci, but rather largely involved secondary insertions of Alu elements. No independent mobile element insertion events were found at orthologous loci in the human and chimpanzee genomes. Therefore, L1 insertion polymorphisms appear to be essentially homoplasy free characters well suited for the study of population genetics and phylogenetic relationships within closely related species."
Characterization of the low-copy HERV-Fc family: evidence for recent integrations in primates of elements with coding envelope genes,"['Benit, L', 'Calteau, A', 'Heidmann, T']",VIROLOGY,10.1016/S0042-6822(03)00163-6,JUL 20 2003,32,"In a previous search based on the envelope gene, we had identified two related proviral elements that could not be included in identified ERV families. An in silico database screening associated with an in vivo polymerase chain reaction search using primers in the reverse transcriptase domain, now allowed identification of a series of related elements, found at a limited number in simians. A phylogenetic analysis led to their inclusion in a new family of endogenous retroviruses with limited expansion, which we named ERV-Fc, and which is part of the enlarged ERV-F/H family. The human genome comprises only six HERV-Fc, among which two possess full-length coding envelope genes. A complete provirus was identified in the baboon, also disclosing a fully open envelope gene. Cloning of the sites orthologous to the envelope-coding human proviruses demonstrated presence of the integrated proviruses in chimpanzee and gorilla, but not in orangutan. For the baboon element, the orthologous locus was found empty even in the phylogenetically most closely related macaque, again suggestomg, together with the complete identity of its LTRs, ""recent"" integration. The data presented are compatible with an evolutionary scheme in which the ERV-Fc proviruses would be the endogenous traces of an active retroviral element, possibly acting as an infectious retrovirus with low endogeneization potency, with evidence for integrations at two distinct periods of primate evolution.

Divergence of the genes on human chromosome 21 between human and other hominoids and variation of substitution rates among transcription units,"['Shi, JX', 'Xi, HF', 'Wang, Y', 'Zhang, CH', 'Jiang, ZW', 'Zhang, KX', 'Shen, YY', 'Jin, L', 'Zhang, KY', 'Yuan, WT', 'Wang, Y', 'Lin, J', 'Hua, Q', 'Wang, FQ', 'Xu, SH', 'Ren, SX', 'Xu, SJ', 'Zhao, GP', 'Chen, Z', 'Jin, L', 'Huang, W']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1332748100,JUL 8 2003,33,"The study of genomic divergence between humans and primates may provide insight into the origins of human beings and the genetic basis of unique human traits and diseases. Chromosome 21 is the smallest chromosome in the human genome, and some of its regions have been implicated in mental retardation and other diseases. in this study, we sequenced the coding and regulatory regions of 127 known genes on human chromosome 21 in DNA samples from human and chimpanzees and a part of the corresponding genes from orangutan, gorilla, and macaque. Overall, 3,003 nucleotide differences between human and chimpanzee were identified over approximate to400 kb. The differences in coding, promoter, and exon-intron junction regions were 0.51 +/- 0.02%, 0.88 +/- 0.03%, and 0.85 +/- 0.02%, respectively, much lower than the previously reported 1.23% in genomic regions, which suggests the presence of purifying selection. Significant variation in substitution rate among genes was observed by comparing the divergence between human and chimpanzee. Furthermore, by implementing a bioinformatics-based approach, we showed that the identification of genetic variants specific to the human lineage might lead to an understanding of the mechanisms that are attributable to the phenotypes that unique to humans, by changing the structure and/or dosage of the proteins expressed. A phylogenetic analysis unambiguously confirms the conclusion that chimpanzees were our closest relatives to the exclusion of other primates and the relative divergence of the Homo-Pan and that of (Homo-Pan)Gorilla are 4.93 million years and 7.26 million years, respectively."
New approaches in hominoid taxonomy: Morphometrics,"['Guy, F', 'Brunet, M', 'Schmittbuhl, M', 'Viriot, L', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFRICANUS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10261,JUL 2003,30,"We report here on new cranial data relevant to hominoid taxonomic analyses, based on a study of 438 skulls belonging to 13 nonhuman living hominoid taxa. Nineteen landmarks were selected to describe the overall shape of the maxillofacial complex, in order to investigate its discriminative power in taxonomic analyses. We used a geometric morphometrics approach to depict morphological variation from the genus down to the subspecific level, and we evaluated whether our morphologic criteria are relevant to discriminating species and subspecies among living hominoids. Considering previous genetic studies, we discuss whether our results can be extrapolated to the hominin fossil record, providing a reference for species and subspecies morphologic differentiation. Our results indicate that the relative warp method, as applied to facial landmarks, provides a powerful tool to discriminate taxa down to a subspecific level. Results show a noticeable divergence of P. t. verus compared to P. t. troglodytes and P. t. schweinfurthii. According to our data, the distance between eastern and western gorilla populations as well as between Bornean and Sumatran orang-utan subspecies is as great as between the two species of Pan. In the same manner, differences between Hylobates and Symphalangus are similar to those between Pan and Gorilla genera. Congruence between the morphological distances computed in this study and previous morphological and genetical studies strongly supports their relevance for morphological species recognition in paleoanthropology. Our data provide an objective standard for assessing taxonomic differences among hominoids, and will enable us to define more precisely the significance of morphological differences in the fossil record.

"Gestural communication in young gorillas (Gorilla gorilla): Gestural repertoire, learning, and use","['Pika, S', 'Liebal, K', 'Tomasello, M']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.10097,JUL 2003,83,"In the present study we investigated the gestural communication of gorillas (Gorilla gorilla). The subjects were 13 gorillas (1-6 years old) living in two different groups in captivity. Our goal was to compile the gestural repertoire of subadult gorillas, with a special focus on processes of social cognition, including attention to individual and developmental variability, group variability, and flexibility of use. Thirty-three different gestures (six auditory, 11 tactile, and 16 visual gestures) were recorded. We found idiosyncratic gestures, individual differences, and similar degrees of concordance between and within groups, as well as some group-specific gestures. These results provide evidence that ontogenetic ritualization is the main learning process involved, but some form of social learning may also be responsible for the acquisition of special gestures. The present study establishes that gorillas have a multifaceted gestural repertoire, characterized by a great deal of flexibility with accommodations to various communicative circumstances, including the attentional state of the recipient. The possibility of assigning Seyfarth and Cheney's [1997] model for nonhuman primate vocal development to the development of nonhuman primate gestural communication is discussed.

Application of a reduced-scale model of occlusion: the ""occlusal matrix""","['Guichard, P', 'Orthlieb, JD', 'Mafart, B']",ANTHROPOLOGIE,10.1016/S0003-5521(03)00023-2,JUL-SEP 2003,0,"We analyzed by a reduced-scale model of occlusion named ""occlusal matrix"" (M.O.), the report of the dental arches between the various anatomical pillars which are the first permanent molars (M 1) and the final canines (C). We define thus 3 measurements, the total area of the occlusal matrix: M.O. (AT), the area of the superior face, representing palatine face: M.O. (FS) and the area of the inferior face: M.O. (FI), representing mandibulary face. This morphometric study was carried out on skulls of current Great Apes (Pan, Gorilla and Pongo), medieval and subcurrent populations living in southeast France (Provence) and on skulls mouldings of fossil Hommids. In the evolution of Hominoids towards the current man, a regular reduction of studied areas and thus of the jaws is confirmed by the recourse to these 3 new measurements designated by our study. In addition, the various stages of this reduction correspond in all points to those described for the general evolution of the higher primates. So, these 3 new measurements appear like particularly powerful describing with a simple tool the occlusal evolution of the Hominoids and making it possible to better define their phyletic position within the framework of paleontological research.

Comparative analysis of gene-expression patterns in human and African great ape cultured fibroblasts,"['Karaman, MW', 'Houck, ML', 'Chemnick, LG', 'Nagpal, S', 'Chawannakul, D', 'Sudano, D', 'Pike, BL', 'Ho, VV', 'Ryder, OA', 'Hacia, JG']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.1289803,JUL 2003,79,"Although much is known about genetic variation in human and African great ape (chimpanzee, bonobo, and gorilla) genomes, substantially less is known about variation in gene-expression profiles within and among these species. This information is necessary for defining transcriptional regulatory networks that contribute to complex phenotypes unique to humans or the African great apes. We took a systematic approach to this problem by investigating gene-expression profiles in well-defined cell populations from humans, bonobos, and gorillas. By comparing these profiles from 18 human and 21 African great ape primary fibroblast cell lines, we found that gene-expression patterns could predict the species, but not the age, of the fibroblast donor. Several differentially expressed genes among human and African great ape fibroblasts involved the extracellular matrix, metabolic pathways, signal transduction, stress responses, as well as inherited overgrowth and neurological disorders. These gene-expression patterns could represent molecular adaptations that influenced the development of species-specific traits in humans and the African great apes."

Clinical signs included progressive abdominal enlargement, apathy and anorexia. Macroscopical changes consisted of severe peritonitis and foci of hepatic necrosis with large cavities replacing most of the normal tissue. Additionally, a few structures resembling hydatid cysts were present. Histologically, some necrotic areas contained fragments of a laminated wall characteristic of echinococcal metacestodes. Only a few areas showed the multiloculated architecture typical of Echinococcus multilocularis. Serum antibodies against E. multilocularis antigen were detected in both animals, and granulomatous and necrotizing hepatitis with severe peritonitis due to E. multilocularis was diagnosed. The pathological changes in alveolar echinococcosis in gorillas appear to resemble more closely those found in human beings than those in other non-human primates. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Possible polyphyletic origin of major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A (MICA) alleles,"['Choy, MK', 'Phipps, ME']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-002-2444-8,JUL 2003,4,"Phylogenetic relationships among 23 nonhuman primate (NHP) major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene (MIC) sequences, 54 confirmed human MICA alleles, and 16 human MICE alleles were constructed with methods of sequence analysis. Topology of the phylogenetic tree showed separation between NHP MICs and human MICs. For human MICs, the topology indicated monophyly for the MICB alleles, while MICA alleles were separated into two lineages, LI and LII. Of these, LI MICA alleles shared a common ancestry with gorilla (Ggo) MIC. One conservative amino acid difference and two nonconservative amino acid differences in the alpha3 domain were found between the MICA lineages. The nonconservative amino acid differences might imply structural and functional differences. Transmembrane (TM) trinucleotide-repeat variants were found to be specific to the MICA lineages such as A4, A9, and A10 to LI and A5 to LII. Variants such as A5.1 and A6 were commonly found in both MICA lineages. Based on these analyses, we postulate a polyphyletic origin for MICA alleles and their division into two lineages, LI and LII. As such, there would be 30 alleles in LI and 24 alleles in LII, thereby reducing the current level of polymorphism that exists, based on a presumed monophyletic origin. The lower degree of polymorphism in MICA would then be in line with the rest of the human major histocompatibility complex nonclassical class I genes."
Gorillas in the crossfire: population dynamics of the Virunga mountain gorillas over the past three decades,"['Kalpers, J', 'Williamson, EA', 'Robbins, MM', 'McNeilage, A', 'Nzamurambaho, A', 'Lola, N', 'Mugiri, G']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605303000589,JUL 2003,51,"Small populations are particularly susceptible to disturbance. Routine censusing to monitor changes is important for understanding both population dynamics and the effectiveness of conservation strategies. Mountain gorillas Gorilla beringei beringei in the Virunga Volcanoes region of Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo have been censused five times since 1970. However, due to war and political unrest in the region since 1990, no census had been conducted since 1989, when the population was thought to number 324 gorillas. In 2000 we estimated population size using repeated observations of 17 habituated groups and information on 15 unhabituated groups obtained during patrols. The minimum population was 359 gorillas, and a best-case scenario correcting for groups that might not have been counted was 395. Using the minimum population and best-case scenario respectively, this represents a 0.9% or 1.8% annual growth rate over the last decade and 1.0% or 1.3% annual growth rate since 1972. This is lower than growth estimates made in several population viability analyses, but approximately 5% of the 1989 population is known to have died due to military activity over the last decade. Different subsets of the population exhibited different responses to disturbance caused by war. We discuss conservation strategies that are likely to have contributed to an increase in the gorilla population during this time of turmoil. While the population has grown, the results should be viewed with caution, not only because all known growth during the last decade can be attributed to one subset of the population, but also because the region is still plagued by political unrest."
Abundant gene conversion between arms of palindromes in human and ape Y chromosomes,"['Rozen, S', 'Skaletsky, H', 'Marszalek, JD', 'Minx, PJ', 'Cordum, HS', 'Waterston, RH', 'Wilson, RK', 'Page, DC']",NATURE,10.1038/nature01723,JUN 19 2003,293,"Eight palindromes comprise one-quarter of the euchromatic DNA of the male-specific region of the human Y chromosome, the MSY(1). They contain many testis-specific genes and typically exhibit 99.97% intra-palindromic (arm-to-arm) sequence identity(1). This high degree of identity could be interpreted as evidence that the palindromes arose through duplication events that occurred about 100,000 years ago. Using comparative sequencing in great apes, we demonstrate here that at least six of these MSY palindromes predate the divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages, which occurred about 5 million years ago. The arms of these palindromes must have subsequently engaged in gene conversion, driving the paired arms to evolve in concert. Indeed, analysis of MSY palindrome sequence variation in existing human populations provides evidence of recurrent arm-to-arm gene conversion in our species. We conclude that during recent evolution, an average of approximately 600 nucleotides per newborn male have undergone Y-Y gene conversion, which has had an important role in the evolution of multi-copy testis gene families in the MSY."
Implications of natural selection in shaping 99.4% nonsynonymous DNA identity between humans and chimpanzees: Enlarging genus Homo,"['Wildman, DE', 'Uddin, M', 'Liu, GZ', 'Grossman, LI', 'Goodman, M']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1232172100,JUN 10 2003,139,"What do functionally important DNA sites, those scrutinized and shaped by natural selection, tell us about the place of humans in evolution? Here we compare approximate to90 kb of coding DNA nucleotide sequence from 97 human genes to their sequenced chimpanzee counterparts and to available sequenced gorilla, orangutan, and Old World monkey counterparts, and, on a more limited basis, to mouse. The nonsynonymous changes (functionally important), like synonymous changes (functionally much less important), show chimpanzees and humans to be most closely related, sharing 99.4% identity at nonsynonymous sites and 98.4% at synonymous sites. On a time scale, the coding DNA divergencies separate the human-chimpanzee clade from the gorilla clade at between 6 and 7 million years ago and place the most recent common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees at between 5 and 6 million years ago. The evolutionary rate of coding DNA in the catarrhine clade (Old World monkey and ape, including human) is much slower than in the lineage to mouse. Among the genes examined, 30 show evidence of positive selection during descent of catarrhines. Nonsynonymous substitutions by themselves, in this subset of positively selected genes, group humans and chimpanzees closest to each other and have chimpanzees diverge about as much from the common human-chimpanzee ancestor as humans do. This functional DNA evidence supports two previously offered taxonomic proposals: family Hominidae should include all extant apes; and genus Homo should include three extant species and two subgenera, Homo (Homo) sapiens (humankind), Homo (Pan) troglodytes (common chimpanzee), and Homo (Pan) paniscus (bonobo chimpanzee)."

","[""M'Kirera, F"", 'Ungar, PS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.10077,JUN 2003,42,"Most research on primate tooth form-function relationships has focused on unworn teeth. This study presents a morphological comparison of variably worn lower second molars (M(2)s) of lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla; n = 47) and common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes; n = 54) using dental topographic analysis. High-resolution replicas of occlusal surfaces were prepared and scanned in 3D by laser scanning. The resulting elevation data were used to create a geographic information system (GIS) for each tooth. Occlusal relief, defined as the ratio of 3D surface area to 2D planometric area of the occlusal table, was calculated and compared between wear stages, taxa, and sexes. The results failed to show a difference in occlusal relief between males and females of a given taxon, but did evince differences between wear stages and between taxa. A lack of significant interaction between wear stage and taxon factors suggests that differences in occlusal relief between chimpanzees and gorillas are maintained throughout the wear sequence. These results add to a growing body of information on how molar teeth change with wear, and how differences between primate species are maintained at comparable points throughout the wear sequence. Such studies provide new insights into form-function relationships, which will allow us to infer certain aspects of diet in fossils with worn teeth. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Four of the five subjects performed above chance on the second-order relations DMTS task within the first block of five sessions. High levels of performance on this task did not result from reliance on perceptual feature matching and thus indicate the capability for abstract relational concepts in two species of great ape."

Histomorphometry and statistics were used to identify various primate species (Hylobates moloch, Pongo satyrus borneensis, Pan tr. troglodytes, Gorilla g. gorilla, Homo sapiens), equid species (Equus caballus, Equus asinus, Equus mulus, Equus hemionus kulan, Equus ferus przewalskii) and also extinct horses e.g. iron age, medieval and neolithic forms on the microstructural level. Furthermore, bones from domesticated cattle, their Neolithic forms, pigs, sheep and goats (Bos taurus, Sus scrofa, Ovis aries, Capra hircus) were examined. Thin sections from proximal metacarpi or radii per species were taken in case of the domesticated animals and from distal humeri in case of the primates. Areas, perimeters, minimal and maximal axis of Haversian canals and secondary osteons were measured on digital images. Canonical discriminant analysis permits a differentiation of the species by these parameters of bone microstructure. Thus it is possible to distinguish between the different primate species, sheep and goats, horses, extinct horses, donkeys, mules and kulans on the microstructural level, however not between cattle and pig, E. f. przewalskii and Equus caballus, medieval and iron age horses. Neolithic cattle and horses do overlap, yet they are different from the modern forms."

The model presented by Smith et al. is inconsistent with current theories and empirical findings oil the comparative aspects of metacognition.

We studied the home range and frugivory patterns of one group of Gorilla beringei beringei in the little-studied population of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, to compare with other populations and to investigate whether there was any relationship between patterns of frugivory and home range size. During the 3-year study, the gorillas ate 16 species of fruit on 27% of observation days. There was high variability in frugivory among the 3 years and no consistent seasonal pattern. Annual home range size was ca. 21 km(2) for Years 1 and 2, and it increased dramatically to 40 km(2) in Year 3. Home range size varied considerable between months and seasons, but there is no clear relationship between occurrence of fruit-eating and home range size. The group exhibited more fruit-eating and a larger home range size those of the gorillas in the Virunga Volcanoes. Their home range size is comparable to that of western gorillas, though Bwindi gorillas consumed less fruit. Home range size and utilization by all gorillas probably depends on a complex relationship between the distribution and abundance of both fruit and herbaceous vegetation and social factors such as male mating tactics."

Seventy-eight percent of the fecal samples (n = 36) contained insects. Ants were found in 61% of the samples, termites in 39%, while 56% of the samples contained remains of other insects. We added, greater than or equal to14 new species to the known insect diet of western lowland gorillas. Overall, social insects are predominant. The choice of prey by the Ntonga gorillas gives new clues for the existence of cross-cultural differences among gorilla populations. A comparison of the overall frequency of insectivory with those at other sites in Central Africa indicate a possible effect of forest disturbance on the insectivorous behavior of gorillas.

Three baboons used head orientation as a cue, and 1 individual also used eye direction alone. As the baboons did not receive prior training with gestural cues, their performance suggests that the competitive paradigm may be more appropriate for testing nonhuman primates than the standard object-choice paradigm. However, the baboons were insensitive to whether the experimenter could actually perceive the food item, and therefore the use of visual orientation cues may not be indicative of visual perspective-taking abilities. Performance was disrupted by the introduction of a screen and objects to conceal food items and by the absence of movement in cues presented."
Going in: The garden of England's gaming zookeeper and Zululand,"['Draper, M', 'Mare, G']",JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES,10.1080/0305707032000075858,JUN 2003,2,"John Aspinall (1926-2000) was an eccentric, wealthy English plutocrat, private zoo-owning conservationist, gambling casino czar, 'white Zulu' patron of the Inkatha Freedom Party in South Africa, and conservative Euro-sceptic politician. He was controversially famous in many spheres, not least for his advocacy and practice of what he called 'going in'. This refers to keepers crossing the boundaries between 'wild' animals and people, entering the zoo enclosures, and bonding with animals such as wolves, tigers and gorillas. In this exploration of an intricate web of social and natural relations, Aspinall serves as our guide to 'going in' - the transgression and occasional blurring of boundaries. Through following Aspinall's career in all the above spheres, we are able to show how, at the level of the elite around the globe, disparate national identities marry and work together to shape environments. In the 'garden of England' (Kent), endangered species such as black rhino were bred in his wildlife parks and returned 'home' to Zululand wilderness. The reactionary politics of English tribalism within Europe found common cause with the politics of Zulu nationalism, which was ideologically endorsed and materially fed. In the style of the mafia, capitalist interests and political patronage were linked by Aspinall's gaming fantasies in the 'Palace of the [Zulu] Kings' theme-park casino bid for Durban - a vision of a transformed space in the urban environment. In Aspinall's world, the natural was seen as ascendant over the cultural. His ideas share a pedigree with the English environmentalists of the 1960s and 1970s and he has been noted as one of the original 'green warriors'. In recent scholarship combining environmental sociology and history, Aspinall's pioneering work in zoological conservation at the frontiers of animal-human relations is singled out as a hopeful example of postmodern culture which, at the same time, generates a misanthropic discourse of disgust with modern humanity. This article traces a significant flight of the northern imagination to the south and shows how word has been translated into deed during the last decade of the twentieth century."

Gorilla behavior in response to systematic alternation between zoo enclosures","['Lukas, KE', 'Hoff, MP', 'Maple, TL']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/S0168-1591(02)00237-X,MAY 21 2003,15,"To determine the effects of relative novelty on captive gorilla behavior, the regular alternation of two groups between complex naturalistic enclosures was studied at Zoo Atlanta. A continuous behavioral change sampling method was used to obtain information on behavior, and instantaneous scans at 10-min intervals provided information on the location of all gorillas in the focal group. An analysis of 226 h of behavioral data and 1386 map location scans showed enclosure rotation was associated with increased enclosure use and feeding and a decrease in self-directed behavior. Gorillas were more likely to increase exhibit use and visibility to zoo visitors during a 4-day novel phase compared to subsequent days in the exhibit. Because of constraints in exhibit design, however, increased use of exhibit did not always result in greater visibility of gorillas to zoo visitors. Gorillas increased locomotion, social distance, use of grass areas, and visibility to the public in their ""Away"" exhibit compared to their ""Home"" exhibit. Regularly alternating gorillas between zoo exhibits is a form of environmental enrichment that can increase gorillas' use of exhibit space and increase activity level. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Patterns of mandibular variation in Pan and Gorilla and implications for African ape taxonomy,"['Taylor, AB', 'Groves, CP']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/S0047-2484(03)00027-7,MAY 2003,29,"Pan and Gorilla taxonomy is currently in a state of flux, with the number of existing species and subspecies of common chimpanzee and gorilla having been recently challenged. While Pan and Gorilla systematics have been evaluated on the basis of craniometric and odontometric data, only a handful of studies have evaluated multivariate craniometric variation within P. troglodytes, and none have evaluated in detail mandibular variation in either P. troglodytes or Gorilla gorilla. In this paper, we examine ontogenetic and adult mandibular variation in Pan and Gorilla. We test the hypothesis that patterns and degrees of mandibular variation in Pan and Gorilla closely correspond to those derived from previous analyses of craniometric variation. We then use these data to address some current issues surrounding Pan and Gorilla taxonomy. Specifically, we evaluate the purported distinctiveness of P.t. verus from the other two subspecies of Pan troglodytes, and the recent proposals to recognize Nigerian gorillas as a distinct subspecies, Gorilla gorilla diehli, and to acknowledge mountain and lowland gorillas as two separate species. Overall, patterns and degrees of multivariate mandibular differentiation parallel those obtained previously for the cranium and dentition. Thus, differences among the three conventionally recognized gorilla subspecies are somewhat greater than among subspecies of common chimpanzees, but differences between P. paniscus and P. troglodytes are greater than those observed between any gorilla subspecies. In this regard, the mandible does not appear to be more variable, or of less taxonomic value, than the face and other parts of the cranium. There are, however, some finer differences in the pattern and degree of morphological differentiation in Pan and Gorilla, both with respect to cranial and dental morphology, and in terms of the application and manner of size adjustment. Mandibular differentiation supports the conventional separation of bonobos from chimpanzees regardless of size adjustment, but size correction alters the relative alignment of taxa. Following size correction, intergroup distances are greatest between P.t. verus and all other groups, but there is considerable overlap amongst chimpanzee subspecies. Amongst gorillas, the greatest separation is between eastern and western gorillas, but adjustment relative to palatal vs. basicranial length results in a greater accuracy of group classification for G.g. gorilla and G.g. graueri, and more equivalent intergroup distances amongst all gorilla groups. We find no multivariate differentiation of the Nigerian gorillas based on mandibular morphology, suggesting that the primary difference between Nigerian and other western lowland gorillas lies in the nuchal region. Though intergroup distances are greatest between P.t. verus and other chimpanzee subspecies, the degree of overlap amongst all three groups does not indicate a markedly greater degree of distinction in mandibular, as opposed to other morphologies. Finally, mandibular differentiation corroborates previous craniodental studies indicating the greatest distinction amongst gorillas is between eastern and western groups. Thus, patterns and degrees of mandibular variation are in agreement with other kinds of data that have been used to diagnose eastern and western gorillas as separate species, (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Animal self-medication and ethno-medicine: exploration and exploitation of the medicinal properties of plants,"['Huffman, MA']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NUTRITION SOCIETY,10.1079/PNS2003257,MAY 2003,105,"Early in the co-evolution of plant-animal relationships, some arthropod species began to utilize the chemical defences of plants to protect themselves from their own predators and parasites. It is likely, therefore, that the origins of herbal medicine have their roots deep within the animal kingdom. From prehistoric times man has looked to wild and domestic animals for sources of herbal remedies. Both folklore and living examples provide accounts of how medicinal plants were obtained by observing the behaviour of animals. Animals too learn about the details of self-medication by watching each other. To date, perhaps the most striking scientific studies of animal self-medication have been made on the African great apes. The great ape diet is often rich in plants containing secondary compounds of non-nutritional, sometimes toxic, value that suggest medicinal benefit from their ingestion. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) are known to swallow whole and defecate intact leaves. The habit has been shown to be a physical means of purging intestinal parasites. Chimpanzees and man co-existing in sub-Saharan Africa are also known to ingest the bitter pith of Vernonia amygdalina for the control of intestinal nematode infections. Phytochemical studies have demonstrated a wide array of biologically-active properties in this medicinal plant species. In light of the growing resistance of parasites and pathogens to synthetic drugs, the study of animal self-medication and ethno-medicine offers a novel line of investigation to provide ecologically-sound methods for the treatment of parasites using plant-based medicines in populations and their livestock living in the tropics."

Gabon and the Republic of Congo alone are thought to hold roughly 80% of the world's gorillas(2) and most of the common chimpanzees(1). Here we present survey results conservatively indicating that ape populations in Gabon declined by more than half between 1983 and 2000. The primary cause of the decline in ape numbers during this period was commercial hunting, facilitated by the rapid expansion of mechanized logging. Furthermore, Ebola haemorrhagic fever is currently spreading through ape populations in Gabon and Congo and now rivals hunting as a threat to apes. Gorillas and common chimpanzees should be elevated immediately to 'critically endangered' status. Without aggressive investments in law enforcement, protected area management and Ebola prevention, the next decade will see our closest relatives pushed to the brink of extinction."
Variability of Broca's area homologue in African great apes: Implications for language evolution,"['Sherwood, CC', 'Broadfield, DC', 'Holloway, RL', 'Gannon, PJ', 'Patrick, RH']",ANATOMICAL RECORD PART A-DISCOVERIES IN MOLECULAR CELLULAR AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.a.10046,APR 2003,58,"The cortical circuits subserving neural processing of human language are localized to the inferior frontal operculum and the posterior perisylvian region. Functional language dominance has been related to anatomical asymmetry of Broca's area and the planum temporale. The evolutionary history of these asymmetric patterns, however, remains obscure. Although testing of hypotheses about the evolution of language areas requires comparison to homologous regions in the brains of our closest living relatives, the great apes, to date little is known about normal interindividual variation of these regions in this group. Here we focus on Brodmann's area 44 in African great apes (Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla). This area corresponds to the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and has been shown to exhibit both gross and cytoarchitectural asymmetries in humans. We calculated frequencies of sulcal variations and mapped the distribution of cytoarchitectural area 44 to determine whether its boundaries occurred at consistent macrostructural landmarks. A considerable amount of variation was found in the distribution of the inferior frontal sulci among great ape brains. The inferior precentral sulcus in particular was often bifurcated, which made it impossible to determine the posterior boundary of the pars opercularis. In addition, the distribution of Brodmann's area 44 showed very little correspondence to surface anatomy. We conclude that gross morphologic patterns do not offer substantive landmarks for the measurement of Brodmann's area 44 in great apes. Whether or not Broca's area homologue of great apes exhibits humanlike asymmetry can only be resolved through further analyses of microstructural components. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Inhibition thresholds for tannic acid were [2.9-3.5] mM in Pongo and [2.9-5.9] mM in Pan.

A longitudinal study was conducted with 98 infants who were seen at intervals of 3 months from 9-24 months of age. At each session, the infants were administered a preferential-looking test whereby they were presented with a video image of themselves alongside a video image of a same-aged peer in two conditions, unmarked and marked. From the 12-month session onwards, the infants were also administered a version of the standard ""mark test"" of MSR. The infants showed a significant preference for looking at images of themselves in both conditions coincident with the onset of MSR. This result indicates that developing an interest in the self-image is an important component in the development of MSR. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved."
"Naive encounters with chimpanzees in the Goualougo Triangle, Republic of Congo","['Morgan, D', 'Sanz, C']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1023005417897,APR 2003,12,"We describe the behavior of an unhabituated population of chimpanzees in the Goualougo Triangle, Republic of Congo. We encountered chimpanzee parties on 218 occasions during two field seasons ( February 1999 - December 1999, June 2000 - June 2001). Overall contact rate was 0.63 contacts per day in the field (n = 347). During the first 5 min of observation, we recorded individual responses as curious, ignore, hide, or depart. In contrast to other unhabituated chimpanzees, curiosity was the most common response (84%) of individuals in the Goualougo Triangle. However, the responses were deeply integrated in the group's reaction to our arrival and behavior throughout an encounter. Based on the behavior of the majority of individuals in a group, we categorized entire contact events as naive, ignore, nervous, or depart. Naive contacts accounted for 69% of all encounters. Other contacts types occurred much less frequently: nervous (12%), depart (11%), ignore (8%). Naive contacts were characterized by chimpanzees that continued to exhibit curiosity throughout the encounter, the arrival of other individuals at the contact location, and relatively prolonged contact with observers ( average duration: 136 min). It is likely that the high frequency of curious responses and naive contacts are due to the remote location of the Goualougo Triangle and the chimpanzees's lack of experience with humans. Documentation of this naive phenomenon has been successfully used to lobby for the protection of the chimpanzees and their habitat."
Comparative study of urinary reproductive hormones in great apes,"['Shimizu, K', 'Udono, T', 'Tanaka, C', 'Narushima, E', 'Yoshihara, M', 'Takeda, M', 'Tanahashi, A', 'van Elsackar, L', 'Hayashi, M', 'Takenaka, O']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-002-0021-9,APR 2003,15,"Urinary estrone conjugates (EIC), pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PdG), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were determined by enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) during the normal menstrual cycle in the orangutan, gorilla, chimpanzee, and bonobo. Furthermore, the data were compared to those levels in the human and long-tailed macaque. The results showed a typical preovulatory E1C surge and postovulatory increase in PdG in all species. The pattern of E1C during the menstrual cycle in the great apes more closely resembled the human than do the long-tailed macaque. A major difference of E1C pattern between these species appeared in the luteal phase. In the great apes and the human, E1C exhibited two peaks, the first peak detected at approximately mid cycle and the second peak detected during the luteal phase. On the other hand, in the long-tailed macaque, increase of E1C in the luteal phase was small or nonexistent. The gorilla, chimpanzee, and bonobo exhibited similar PdG trends. The orangutan excreted one tenth less PdG than these species during the lineal phase. The long-tailed macaque also excreted low levels of PdG. The patterns of FSH in orangutan, chimpanzee, bonobo and long-tailed macaque showed a marked mid-cycle rise and an early follicular phase rise, similar to those in the human. Comparing similar taxa, a large difference was found in FSH of gorilla; there were three peaks during the menstrual cycle. Thus, there is considerable species variation in the excretion of these hormones during the menstrual cycle and comparative studies could be approached with a single method. The methods and baseline data presented here provide the basis for a practical approach to evaluation and monitoring of ovarian events in the female great apes."
A solution to the worn tooth conundrum in primate functional anatomy,"['Ungar, PS', ""M'Kirera, F""]",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0637016100,APR 1 2003,71,"Worn teeth are a bane to paleobiologists interested in the diets of human ancestors and other fossil primates. Although worn teeth dominate fossil assemblages, their shapes are usually not used to reconstruct the diets of extinct species. The problem is that traditional studies of primate dental functional anatomy have focused on unworn morphology. This has limited most functional analyses to only a few well-represented fossil species. This paper introduces a method to characterize and compare worn occlusal morphology in primates using laser scanning and geographic information systems technologies. A study of variably worn chimpanzee and gorilla molars indicates that differences between these species in tooth shape remain consistent at given stages of wear. Although cusp slope decreases with wear in both taxa, angularity values remain unchanged. These results indicate that African ape teeth wear in a manner that keeps them mechanically efficient for fracturing specific foods. Studies of changes in tooth shape with wear add a new dimension to dental functional anatomy, and offer a more complete picture of dental-dietary adaptations. Also, given how rare unworn teeth are in the fossil record, the ability to include worn specimens in analyses opens the door to reconstructing the diets of many more extinct primate groups, allowing us to better understand the adaptive radiation of our order."
The mystery of Agatha Christie: Notes to the dissociative fugue,"['Rossi, R', 'Attolini, L', 'Berti, A', 'Maberino, C']",SALUD MENTAL,NA,APR 2003,0,"The authors compare the biography written by Cade on Agatha Christie's temporary disappearance to an episode of dissociation of consciousness experienced by a young man during the demonstration against G8 meeting.

Between the 4(th) and the 14(th) of December 1926, Agatha Christie suddenly disappears from her house in Berkshire, after her mother's death and her husband's confession of having a lover. The police finds the writer only one week later at a hotel in a spa of Yorkshire where she has registered under a false name.

This year 1926 is really very important for Mrs. Christie. Actually she escapes from her middle-class life to the provincial silence of Yorkshire and later she begins to spend most of her time in travels. In the Middle East she meets an archaeologist and after marrying him she starts joining him in expeditions.

But also her fictions' characters change: they are no longer middle-class people as described in Orient Express, instead they become the heroes of thrillers, set in Egypt (let's think about Death on the Nile, Murder in Mesopotamia, Death comes as the end).

The different settings of the books and what happens in the real life of Agatha Christie lead us think about a regressive fugue, directed towards reducing anguish derived from dissatisfaction.

We can also see her desire to go back to a pre-natal condition just to humble herself.

A similar situation experienced by Francesco is described by the authors. He is a young man who has seen an analyst for a few months and a previous latent tendency to homosexuality is invading and alarming him.

During the riots occurred against the G8 meeting Francesco is in the crowd in the centre of Genova. Suddenly, the psychic control operated by the crowd fails and he doesn't know why he is there and makes for the analyst's office for an unespected session.

It is Saturday and trough he usually goes for a session on Monday the analyst makes no comment and accepts to take him. Francesco tells a dream in which a gorilla appears and scares him; he associates it with an ugly and bearded woman, a circus freak. In a very simplistic way Nile can say that the anguish caused by the brawls during the G8 meeting determined the amnestic fuge, but we must consider the dream. This dream reveals the real distress occurred when the crowd dispersed: a hairy gorilla that reminds him of a terribile mother who leaves ruthlessly.

An interpretation of this picture is intended to be given by the authors. Of course the central problem is the hysterical mechanism. In front of a unbearable conflict Ego consciousness is altered.

If the relationship with other people is the central problem the relational attitude should be altered in order to cancel it. So, we can make the body ill, or in a more complex way we can alter the motor function, the sensitive or the sensory one.

At his highest level the most complicated relational function is involved: the Ego consciousness with its four dimensions described by Jaspers (spatial unity, temporal unity, affective continuity and a feeling of one's boundaries).

In this spectrum we can find psychogenic amnesia and dissociation of consciousness, both involving the relational function, from memory to lies, to theatrical techniques.

The two cases presented are the starting point to some observations on the correlations between hysteria, acute psychoses and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. All these disorders are joined by Ego consciousness dissociation and destructuration mechanisms, even if at different hierarchical levels.

The alteration of communication though is not enough and we must consider a new mechanism, more than hysterical one, to create a new spatial condition and look elsewhere to solve the conflict.

Finally the authors try to elaborate a therapeutical model by reconstructing the internal fiction."

Attempts to understand the apes' behaviour have led to the development of a purely mechanistic model of imitation, the 'behaviour parsing' model, in which the statistical regularities that are inevitable in planned behaviour are used to decipher the organization of another agent's behaviour, and thence to imitate parts of it. Behaviour can thereby be understood statistically in terms of its correlations (circumstances of use, effects on the environment) without understanding of intentions or the everyday physics of cause-and-effect. Thus, imitation of complex, novel behaviour may not require mentalizing, but conversely behaviour parsing may be a necessary preliminary to attributing intention and cause."
Human specific loss of olfactory receptor genes,"['Gilad, Y', 'Man, O', 'Paabo, S', 'Lancet, D']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0535697100,MAR 18 2003,172,"Olfactory receptor (OR) genes constitute the basis for the sense of smell and are encoded by the largest mammalian gene superfamily of >1,000 genes. In humans, >60% of these are pseudogenes. In contrast, the mouse OR repertoire, although of roughly equal size, contains only approximate to20% pseudogenes. We asked whether the high fraction of nonfunctional OR genes is specific to humans or is a common feature of all primates. To this end, we have compared the sequences of 50 human OR coding regions, regardless of their functional annotations, to those of their putative orthologs in chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and rhesus macaques. We found that humans have accumulated mutations that disrupt OR coding regions roughly 4-fold faster than any other species sampled. As a consequence, the fraction of OR pseudogenes in humans is almost twice as high as in the non-human primates, suggesting a human-specific process of OR gene disruption, likely due to a reduced chemosensory dependence relative to apes."
"Status and ecology of the golden monkey (Cercopithecus mitis kandti) in Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, Uganda","['Twinomugisha, D', 'Basuta, GI', 'Chapman, CA']",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,10.1046/j.1365-2028.2003.00409.x,MAR 2003,7,"Given the degree to which tropical ecosystems are currently being disturbed by human activities, it is essential to set priorities for conservation and thus it becomes important to consider how best to set these priorities. From this perspective, this study provides the first detailed investigations of Cercopithecus mitis kandt i, the golden monkey, focusing on the population in Mgahinga Gorilla National Park (MGNP), Uganda. Specifically, we (1) establish the current status of the golden monkey in terms of population size and distribution within the park in relation to vegetation types and altitude, and (2) investigate the golden monkey's feeding ecology. A total of 67 censuses of 4+ km transects were conducted along a cumulative distance of 299 km and 132 social groups were encountered. Densities were estimated to have increased by 1.6 times since a census 8 years ago, and the total population in the park is estimated to be between 3164 and 5059 individuals. The average size of golden monkey groups in MGNP is 30 individuals (range 3-62). This is similar to that of other subspecies in neighbouring forests. In contrast, the census conducted 8 years before estimated average group size to be eight individuals. Golden monkeys were observed to eat 21 plant species and they were inferred to eat an additional eleven from signs left behind and reports. Both study groups relied upon leaves (primarily young leaves), fruits and invertebrates for food, but the amount of time they fed on these different types of foods varied between the groups. Given the apparent increase in density since the census 8 years ago, the golden monkeys of MGNP appear to be doing well. However, given the number of snares and the extent of illegal extraction of bamboo found during the census, conservation efforts should be increased."

In experiment 1, the dogs were tested with retention intervals of 0, 10, 30, and 60 s. Results revealed that the dogs' accuracy declined as a function of the length of the retention interval but remained above chance for each retention interval. In experiment 2, with new subjects, longer retention intervals (0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 s) were presented to the dogs. Results replicated findings from experiment I and revealed that the dogs' accuracy remained higher than chance level with delays up to 240 s. In both experiments, the analysis of errors also showed that the dogs searched as a function of the proximity of the target box and were not subject to intertrial proactive interference. In the discussion, we explore different alternatives to explain why dogs' search behaviour for hidden objects decreased as a function of the retention intervals."
Genetic sex identification in orangutans.,"['Steiper, Michael E', 'Ruvolo, Maryellen']",Anthropologischer Anzeiger; Bericht uber die biologisch-anthropologische Literatur,NA,2003-Mar,5,"To date, no established protocol for genetic sex identification in orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) exists. In nearly all apes (gibbons, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans), genetic sex identification is possible using the amelogenin gene because copies located on X and Y chromosomes have different sizes. Here we report that orangutan sex identification can be resolved through multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the Y-linked SRY locus and the amelogenin locus. PCR amplifications of orangutan amelogenin produces one fragment size in both sexes, while SRY amplifies only in males. This protocol will allow primatologists to identify the sex of orangutans through genetic analysis."

Large-scale variation among human and great ape genomes determined by array comparative genomic hybridization,"['Locke, DP', 'Segraves, R', 'Carbone, L', 'Archidiacono, N', 'Albertson, DG', 'Pinkel, D', 'Eichler, EE']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.1003303,MAR 2003,93,"Large-scale genomic rearrangements are a major force Of evolutionary change and the ascertainment of such events between the human and great ape genomes is fundamental to a complete understanding of the genetic history and evolution of our species. Here, we present the results of an evolutionary analysis utilizing array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), measuring copy-number gains and losses among these species. Using an array of 2460 human bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) (12% of the genome), we identified a total of 63 sites of putative DNA copy-number variation between humans and the great apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and orangutan). Detailed molecular characterization of a subset of these sites confirmed rearrangements ranging from 40 to at least 175 kb in size. Surprisingly, the majority of variant sites differentiating great ape and human genomes were found within interstitial euchromatin. These data suggest that such large-scale events are not restricted solely to subtelomeric or pericentromeric regions, but also occur within genic regions. In addition, 519 of the verified variant sites localized to areas of intrachromosomal segmental duplication within the human genome. On the basis of the frequency of duplication in humans, this represents a 14-fold positional bias. In contrast to previous cytogenetic and comparative mapping studies, these results indicate extensive local repatterning of hominoid chromosomes in euchromatic regions through a duplication-driven mechanism of genome evolution."
Segmental duplications in euchromatic regions of human chromosome 5: A source of evolutionary instability and transcriptional innovation,"['Courseaux, A', 'Richard, F', 'Grosgeorge, J', 'Ortola, C', 'Viale, A', 'Turc-Carel, C', 'Dutrillaux, B', 'Gaudray, P', 'Nahon, JL']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.490303,MAR 2003,33,"Recent analyses of the structure of pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions have revealed that these particular regions of human chromosomes are often composed of blocks of duplicated genomic segments that have been associated with rapid evolutionary turnover among the genomes of closely related primates. In the present study, we show that euchromatic regions of human chromosome 5-5p14, 5p13, 5q13, 5q15-5q21-also display such an accumulation of segmental duplications. The structure, organization and evolution of those primate-specific sequences were Studied in detail by combining in silica and comparative FISH analyses on human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutang, macaca, and capuchin chromosomes. Our results lend support to a two-step model of transposition duplication in the euchromatic regions, with a founder insertional event at the time of divergence between Platyrrhini and Catarrhini (25-35 million years ago) and an apparent burst of inter-and intrachromosomal duplications in the Hominidae lineage. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis suggests that the chronology and, likely, molecular mechanisms, differ regarding the region of primary insertion-euchromatic versus pericentromeric regions. Lastly, we show that as their counterparts located near the heterochromatic region, the euchromatic segmental duplications have consistently reshaped their region of insertion during primate evolution, creating putative mosaic genes, and they are obvious candidates for causing ectopic rearrangements that have contributed to evolutionary/genomic instability."

This potentially leads to a safer and more efficient meniscectomy. Furthermore, the current scissors handles of arthroscopic punches are ergonomically not sufficient. An ergonomic handle is designed with one lever that enables opening and closing of the instrument tip, and side-ways steering of the instrument tip. The design of the handle complies with ergonomic guidelines that were found in the literature. A model of the instrument tip was added to the new handle for comparison with conventional handles. Experiments were performed with a knee joint model, using objective and subjective criteria. The results show that the concept of a side-ways steerable punch is promising, since faster task times are achieved without increasing the risk of damaging healthy tissue. The current design of the ergonomic handle incorporates two degrees of freedom in an intuitive way, the handle is more comfortable to hold, and easy to control. The external memory capabilities of the new handle could be improved. Further development of this handle and the addition of a sufficient instrument tip and force transmission are recommended."
Estimation of divergence times for major lineages of primate species,"['Glazko, GV', 'Nei, M']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msg050,MAR 2003,231,"dAlthough the phylogenetic relationships of major lineages of primate species are relatively well established, the times of divergence of these lineages as estimated by molecular data are still controversial. This controversy has been generated in part because different authors have used different types of molecular data, different statistical methods, and different calibration points. We have therefore examined the effects of these factors on the estimates of divergence times and reached the following conclusions: (1) It is advisable to concatenate many gene sequences and use a multigene gamma distance for estimating divergence times rather than using the individual gene approach. (2) When sequence data from many nuclear genes are available, protein sequences appear to give more robust estimates than DNA sequences. (3) Nuclear proteins are generally more suitable than mitochondrial proteins for time estimation. (4) It is important first to construct a phylogenetic tree for a group of species using some outgroups and then estimate the branch lengths. (5) It appears to be better to use a few reliable calibration points rather than many unreliable ones. Considering all these factors and using two calibration points, we estimated that the human lineage diverged from the chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, Old World monkey, and New World monkey lineages approximately 6 MYA (with a range of 5-7), 7 MYA (range, 6-8), 13 MYA (range, 12-15), 23 MYA (range, 21-25), and 33 MYA (range 32-36)."

Clone OR3 from the orangutan and clone G12 from the gibbon showed a 100% sequence similarity, although they are different species. This indicates that both LTR elements were proliferated during the last 2 to 5 million years from the integration of the original LTR element. A phylogenetic tree that was obtained by the neighbor-joining method revealed a wide overlap of the LTR elements across species, suggesting that the HERV-W LTR family evolved independently during the hominoid evolution."

Stool samples were collected from seven animals (n = 7) presenting episodes of diarrhea. Bright-field light microscopy of stool smears stained with modified acid-fast technique revealed the presence of Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts in four of the stool samples analyzed. All microscopically positive samples were confirmed by PCR using primers designed to amplify DNA fragments from two independent loci, i.e. the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene and the small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) gene. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length ssrRNA gene placed this isolate within a clade that contains all currently known C parvum species/genotypes, closely related to the C parvum pig genotype. Comparison with partial ssrRNA sequences available in the GenBank(TM) revealed 100% sequence identity with the genotype previously identified in Canadian patients. This finding was confirmed further by comparison of the COWP gene partial sequences. Published by Elsevier Science B.V."
"Distribution of TT virus (TTV), TTV-like minivirus, and related viruses in humans and nonhuman primates","['Thom, K', 'Morrison, C', 'Lewis, JCM', 'Simmonds, P']",VIROLOGY,10.1016/S0042-6822(02)00049-1,FEB 15 2003,27,"TT virus (TTV) and TTV-like minivirus (TLMV) are small DNA viruses with single-stranded, closed circular, antisense genomes infecting man. Despite their extreme sequence heterogeneity (>50%), a highly conserved region in the untranslated region (UTR) allows both viruses to be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). TTV/TLMV infection was detected in 88 of too human plasma samples; amplified sequences were differentiated into TTV and TLMV by analysis of melting profiles, showing that both viruses were similarly prevalent. PCR with UTR primers also detected frequent infection with TTV/TLMV-related viruses in a wide range of apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, gibbons) and African monkey species (mangabeys, drills, mandrills). These findings support the hypothesis for the co-evolution of TTV-like viruses with their hosts over the period of primate speciation, potentially analogous to the evolution of primate herpesviruses.

"Nest building in captive Gorilla gorilla gorilla
","['Lukas, KE', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Burks, K', 'Snyder, R', 'Bexell, S', 'Maple, TL']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1021450613272,FEB 2003,9,"Although various aspects of gorilla nest building have been described in wild populations, nest-building behavior of captive gorillas has not been subject to much scientific review. We observed nest building in 17 gorillas during three periods: summer baseline, winter baseline, and winter treatment, in which the amount of available nesting material was doubled. We conducted observations exclusively in the indoor holding area in the hour following evening departure of animal care staff. During baseline, gorillas engaged in nest-building on 3.1% of scans and were on a constructed nest on 27.9% of scans Overall, gorillas spent significantly more time on elevated nests than on floor nests There were no statistically significant sex, age class, or rearing history differences in nest building, time spent on a nest, or nest location preference. Nest building consisted of both gathering and manipulating materials The gorillas spent significantly more time building nests in winter than in summer. Additionally, they were more often on elevated nests during winter than summer. Doubling the amount of nesting material did not increase nest building, but it increased the number of floor nests Our results suggest that providing adequate materials to captive gorillas for nest building may facilitate performance of species-typical nest-building, minimize competition among individuals for nesting sites and materials, and permit individual thermoregulation."
"Medical survey of the local human population to determine possible health risks to the mountain gorillas of Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park, Uganda","['Guerrera, W', 'Sleeman, JM', 'Jasper, SB', 'Pace, LB', 'Ichinose, TY', 'Reif, JS']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1021410931928,FEB 2003,12,"There has been increasing contact between mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) and the human population surrounding Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park (BIFNP) in Uganda. Due to the close taxonomic relationship between humans and gorillas there is potential for disease transmission between them. Preventing the introduction or spread of transmissible diseases to the gorillas is essential to protect them. We interviewed 301 villagers living in close proximity to BIFNP with a medical questionnaire in July, 2000. We collected information on demographics, vaccination and health history, and human/gorilla interaction. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of several diseases in the human population and to evaluate the risk of anthropozoonotic transmission from humans to gorillas We found a high prevalence of disease symptoms such as coughing (72.1%) and fever (56.1%) compatible with acute infectious diseases; over half of the respondents (59.1%) had a specific disease diagnosis within the 6 mo preceding the study. We compared villagers who had visual contact with gorillas in the 6 mo preceding the study (53.5%) to villagers who had no visual contact (46.5%). Men were 2.3 times more likely than women to have visual contact with gorillas In general, the frequency of disease history and symptoms was similar for people with and without contact. The high prevalence of acute infectious diseases in the population surrounding BIFNP and the high rate of contact with gorillas creates the potential for anthropozoonotic disease transmission."

We undertake a comparative genetic analysis among human populations and primate species in the normal variation range, where forces that shaped present diversity can be recognised. We determinate number of repeats of the short tandem repeat through allele length sizing and sequencing methods. Human allele distributions are very similar among populations, ruling out ethnicity as a genetic risk for allele expansion. Primate comparison shows human-specific features, with longer human alleles due to a novel variable trinucleotide repeat, not present in non-human primates, which increased the disease-causing expansion likelihood. SCA8 seems to be a human specific disease. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

Porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) and xenotransplantation: screening for transmission in several clinical trials and in experimental models using non-human primates.,"['Denner, J']",Annals of transplantation,NA,2003,27,"Xenotransplantation may develop into a medical technology able to save or improve the quality of life. Porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), because they are integrated in the genome of all pig strains, because they are produced by normal pig cells, and because they can infect human cell in vitro, are considered to be the main microbiological risk if pig cells, tissues or organs are to be transplanted. Indeed, serial passaging of PERV on human cells, simulating the situation during xenotransplantation, was found to increase the titer of the virus and was associated with corresponding genetic changes in the viral LTR. In vitro infection studies showed a productive infection of primary cells of different species including non-human primates and man. However, using newly developed sensitive detection methods, evidence for PERV transmission was seen neither in over 200 patients who had received porcine xenotransplants nor in butchers frequently exposed to pig tissues. Similarly, rats, guinea pigs, minks, rhesus macaques, pig tailed macaques and baboons inoculated with high doses of PERV and given strong daily immunosuppressive treatment failed to exhibit evidence of infection. These data are crucial for the evaluation of xenotransplantation safety because they demonstrate that PERVs cannot easily be transmitted to other species including man."
Threatened primates experience high human densities: adding an index of threat to the IUCN Red List criteria,"['Harcourt, AH', 'Parks, SA']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/S0006-3207(02)00146-5,JAN 2003,34,"IUCN Red List conservation status is apparently judged mainly by assessment Of Species' susceptibility to threat. However, risk must often depend also on the threat itself. Therefore. we investigate the value of adding to IUCN's current criteria a separate index of threat, human density. Human density in the geographic range of Threatened primate species is significantly higher than in the range of Lower Risk species. Thus, Threatened species are both susceptible. and experience more threat. However. the match is far from perfect. Given abundant other evidence of adverse effects of high human density. the mismatch emphasizes the potential benefit of adding an index of threat to the current criteria. A main advantage might be improved assessment, given the amount of up-to-date data on threats compared with the paucity on reactions to threat. The simplest means of incorporation might be to increase the status of species that experience higher than a certain threshold human density. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."
Multitude multicolor chromosome banding (mMCB) - a comprehensive one-step multicolor FISH banding method,"['Weise, A', 'Heller, A', 'Starke, H', 'Mrasek, K', 'Kuechler, A', 'Pool-Zobel, BL', 'Claussen, U', 'Liehr, T']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000076286,2003,29,"Multicolor chromosome banding (MCB) using one single chromosome-specific MCB probe set per experiment was previously reported as powerful tool in molecular cytogenetics for the characterization of all kinds of human marker chromosomes. However, a quick analysis of karyotypes with highly complex chromosomal changes was hampered by the problem that up to 24 MCB experiments were necessary for a cornprehensive karyotype description. To overcome that limitation the 138 available region-specific microdissection-derived libraries for all human chromosomes were combined to one single probe set, called multitude MCB (mMCB). A typical fluorescence banding pattern along the human karyotype is produced, which can be evaluated either by transforming these profiles into chromosome region-specific pseudo-colors or more reliably by studying the fluorescence profiles. The mMCB probe set has been applied on chromosomes of normal male and female probands, two primary myelodysplastic syndromes and two solid tumor cell lines. Additionally, a cell line of Gorilla gorilla (GGO) studied previously by single chromosome-specific MCB was reevaluated by the mMCB method. All results were in concordance with those obtained in parallel or by other cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic approaches indicating that mMCB is a powerful multicolor FISH banding tool for fast characterization of complex karyotypes.

Gene arrangement at the Rhesus blood group locus of chimpanzees detected by fiber-FISH,"['Suto, Y', 'Ishikawa, Y', 'Hyodo, H', 'Ishida, T', 'Kasai, F', 'Tanoue, T', 'Hayasaka, I', 'Uchikawa, M', 'Juji, T', 'Hirai, M']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000074173,2003,1,"The Rhesus (Rh) blood group system in humans is encoded by two genes with high sequence homology. These two genes, namely, RHCE and RHD, have been implied to be duplicated during evolution. However, the genomic organization of Rh genes in chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates has not been precisely studied. We analyzed the arrangement of the Rh genes of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization on chromatin DNA fibers (fiber-FISH) using two genomic DNA probes that respectively contain introns 3 and 7 of human RH genes. Among the five chimpanzees studied, three were found to be homozygous for the two-Rh-gene type, in an arrangement of Rh (5'-->3') - Rh (3'<--5'). Although a similar gene arrangement can be detected in the RH gene locus of typical Rh-positive humans, the distance between the two genes in chimpanzees was about 50 kb longer than that in humans. The remaining two chimpanzees were homozygous for a four-Rh-gene type, in an arrangement of Rh (5'-->3') - Rh (3'<--5') - Rh (3'<--5') - Rh (3'<--5') within a region spanning about 300 kb. This four-Rh-gene type has not been detected in humans. Further analysis of other great apes showed different gene arrangements: a bonobo was homozygous for the three-Rh-gene type; a gorilla was heterozygous for the one-Rh- and two-Rh-gene types; an orangutan was homozygous for the one-Rh-gene type. Our findings on the intra- and interspecific genomic variations in the Rh gene locus in Hominoids would shed further light on reconstructing the genomic pathways of Rh gene duplication during evolution.

Comparative urinary androstanes in the great apes,"['Hagey, LR', 'Czekala, NM']",GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY,10.1016/S0016-6480(02)00569-5,JAN 2003,16,"Urinary androstanes from seven species of male great apes (human, bonobo, chimpanzee, lowland gorilla, mountain gorilla, Bornean orangutan, and Sumatran orangutan) were separated by HPLC and detected by RIA using two testosterone antibodies. All animals examined showed the presence of testosterone and six additional immunoreactive peaks. Although testosterone was the dominant peak (85%) in human urine, its proportion in urine was much less in the other apes, ranging from a high of 59% in the bonobo and chimpanzee to a low of 24% in the mountain gorilla. Urinary androstanes were also directly visualized using nano-spray mass spectrometry (nanoESI-MS). Although the RIA can qualitatively produce a strong signal for testosterone in unchromatographed urine, it is quantitatively present only as a trace metabolite, as demonstrated by nanoESI-MS. The combination of the two techniques showed large differences in androstane metabolism between the seven species. A previously undescribed testosterone metabolite (tentatively identified as either Delta1- or Delta6-testosterone sulfate) was present in significant proportions in all of the non-human apes examined. We conclude that in the great apes, testosterone is only a trace metabolite in urine, and as a consequence, its measurement may not produce results that parallel the levels of serum testosterone. The RIA measurement of urinary testosterone in part records additional androstane metabolites, which vary even between closely related genera, making the results neither equivalent with nor comparable to different species.

Refinement of a chimpanzee pericentric inversion breakpoint to a segmental duplication cluster,"['Locke, DP', 'Archidiacono, N', 'Misceo, D', 'Cardone, MF', 'Deschamps, S', 'Roe, B', 'Rocchi, M', 'Eichler, EE']",GENOME BIOLOGY,10.1186/gb-2003-4-8-r50,2003,66,"Background: Pericentric inversions are the most common euchromatic chromosomal differences among humans and the great apes. The human and chimpanzee karyotype differs by nine such events, in addition to several constitutive heterochromatic increases and one chromosomal fusion event. Reproductive isolation and subsequent speciation are thought to be the potential result of pericentric inversions, as reproductive boundaries form as a result of hybrid sterility.

Results: Here we employed a comparative fluorescence in situ hybridization approach, using probes selected from a combination of physical mapping, genomic sequence, and segmental duplication analyses to narrow the breakpoint interval of a pericentric inversion in chimpanzee involving the orthologous human 15q11-q13 region. We have refined the inversion breakpoint of this chimpanzee-specific rearrangement to a 600 kilobase (kb) interval of the human genome consisting of entirely duplicated material. Detailed analysis of the underlying sequence indicated that this region comprises multiple segmental duplications, including a previously characterized duplication of the alpha7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit gene (CHRNA7) in 15q13.3 and several Golgin-linked-to-PML, or LCR15, duplications.

Conclusions: We conclude that, on the basis of experimental data excluding the CHRNA7 duplicon as the site of inversion, and sequence analysis of regional duplications, the most likely rearrangement site is within a GLP/LCR15 duplicon. This study further exemplifies the genomic plasticity due to the presence of segmental duplications and highlights their importance for a complete understanding of genome evolution."
Early hominin speciation at the Plio/Pleistocene transition,"['Cameron, DW', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1078/0018-442X-00057,2003,5,"Over the last half-decade or so, there has been an explosion in the recognition of hominin genera and species. We now have the late Miocene genera Orrorin and Sahelanthropus, the mid Pliocene genus Kenyanthropus, three new Pliocene species of Australopithecus (A. anamensis, A. garht and A. bahrelg-hazalt) and a sub species of Ardipithecus (Ar. r. kadabba) to contend with. Excepting also the more traditional species allocated to Paranthropus, Australopithecus and early Homo we are approaching around 15 species over 5 million years (excluding hominin evolution over the last one million years). Can such a large number of hominin species be justified? An examination of extant hominid (Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Pan paniscus) anatomical variability indicates that the range of fossil hominin variability supports the recognition of this large number of fossil species. It is also shown that not all hominins are directly related to the emergence of early Homo and as such have become extinct. Indeed the traditional australopithecine species 'A'. anamensis, 'A'. afarensis and W. garhi are considered here to belong to a distinct genus Praeanthropus. They are also argued not be hominins, but rather an as yet undefined hominid group from which the more derived hominins evolved. The first hominin is represented by A. africanus or a hominin very much like it. The Paranthropus clade is defined by a derived heterochronic condition of peramorphosis, associated with sequential progenesis (contraction of successive growth stages) in brain and dental development, but a mixture of peramorphic and paedomorphic features in its craniofacial anatomy. Conversely, Kenyanthropus and Homo both share a pattern of peramorphosis, associated with sequential hypermorphosis (prolongation of successive growth stages) in brain development, and paedo-morphosis processes in cranial, facial and dental development. This suggests, that these two clades share an important synapomorphy not recognised in the parsimony analyses, suggesting that they may form a sister group relationship to the exclusion of Paranthropus. This highlights the need to re-interpret phylo-genetic results in terms of function and development. The rapid speciation and extinction as argued here is in keeping with other fossil groups in Africa at the Plio/Pleistocene transition. This emphasises that we must approach the pre-australopithecines and hominins as part of the endemic African fauna, and not in isolation to the evolutionary and climatic processes that were operating all around them."
Problems with the use of cladistic analysis in palaeoanthropology,"['Curnoe, D']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1078/0018-442X-00048,2003,9,"Cladistic analysis is a popular method for reconstructing evolutionary relationships on the human lineage. However, it has limitations and hidden assumptions that are often not considered by palaeoanthropologists. Some researchers who are opposed to its use regard cladistics as the preferred method for taxonomic ""splitters"" and claim it has lead to a revitalisation Of typology. Typology remains a part of human evolutionary studies, regardless of the acceptance or use of cladistics. The assumption/preference for ""splitting"" over ""lumping"" in cladistics (alpha) taxonomy and the general failure to evaluate (post-hoc) such taxonomies have served to reinforce this assertion.

Researchers have also adopted a number of practices that are logically untenable or introduce considerable error. The evolutionary trend of human encephalisation, apparently isometric with body size, and concurrent reduction in the gut and masticatory apparatus, suggests continuous cladistic characters are biased by problems of body size.

The method suffers a logical weakness, or circularity, leading to bias when characters with multiple states are used. Coding of such characters can only be done using prior criteria, and this is usually done using an existing phylogenetic scheme. Another problem with coding character states is the handling of variation within species. While this form of variation is usually ignored by palaeoanthropologists, when characters are recognised as varying, their treatment as a separate state adds considerable error to cladograms.

The genetic proximity of humans, chimpanzees and gorillas has important implications for cladistic analyses. It is argued that chimpanzees and gorillas should be treated as ingroup taxa and an alternative outgroup such as orangutans should be used, or an (hypothetical) ancestral body plan developed. Making chimpanzees and gorillas ingroup taxa would considerably enhance the biological utility of anthropological cladograms.

All published human cladograms fail to meet standard quality criteria indicating that none of them may be considered reliable. The continuing uncertainty over the number and composition of fossil human species is the largest single source of error for cladistics and human phylogenetic reconstruction."
Three duplicons form a novel chimeric transcription unit in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 22q11,"['Bridgland, L', 'Footz, TK', 'Kardel, MD', 'Riazi, MA', 'McDermid, HE']",HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s00439-002-0827-y,JAN 2003,9,"Pericentromeric regions of human chromosomes are preferential sites for the integration of duplicated DNA, or ""duplicons"", which often contain gene fragments. Although pericentromeric regions appear to be genomic junkyards, they could also be the birthplace of new genes with novel functions. We have characterized a chimeric transcription unit (cat eye syndrome critical region gene 7, CECR7) formed from three duplicons in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 22q. CECR7 exons show similarity to sequences on chromosomes 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, and elsewhere on 22. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of CECR7 duplicon boundaries in various primate species, and the sequence divergence between the human duplicons and their putative ancestral human loci, CECR7 was probably formed before the separation of macaque and is therefore older than most previously reported pericentromeric duplicons. Expression of CECR7 was detected by RT-PCR in humans and gorilla fibroblasts, but not orangutan, suggesting that expression did not result immediately from the formation of this novel transcription unit, or that expression was silenced in orangutan following its formation."
Studies on the Dombrock blood group system in non-human primates.,"['Mogos, C', 'Schawalder, A', 'Halverson, G R', 'Reid, M E']",Immunohematology / American Red Cross,NA,2003,2,"The Dombrock blood group system consists of five distinct antigens: two antithetical antigens, Doa and Dob, and three high-frequency antigens:Gya,Hy, and Joa. Although the prevalence of Doa and Dob in different populations makes them useful as genetic markers, the scarcity of reliable antibodies to these antigens has prevented this potential from being realized. The gene (DO;ART4) encoding the Dombrock glycoprotein has been cloned and sequenced, and the molecular bases of the various Dombrock phenotypes have been determined. The purpose of this study was to perform DNA-based assays on the DO homolog in non-human primates to determine the degree of conservation in the DO gene. Murine MoAbs to Dombrock protein were developed by standard hybridoma technologies and used to test RBCs from non-human primates by hemagglutination. PCR-RFLP analysis for the six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been defined in human alleles were performed on DNA extracted from fresh or frozen blood samples from numerous non-human primates. Hemagglutination tests with six MoAbs to the Dombrock glycoprotein revealed distinct epitopes on RBCs from the non-human primates. The gorillas and orangutans had the same PCR-RFLP digestion pattern for the six SNPs studied as chimpanzees. Old world monkeys (macaques) were identical at nucleotides (nt) 323, 350, 624, and 793 with the chimpanzees, and at nt 898 the digestion pattern was the same as for the HY1 allele in humans. For the new world monkeys (tamarins and squirrel monkeys) the digestion pattern was conserved for nt 793 but different for nt 624; the other SNPs could not be determined because there was no amplification. The presence of epitopes recognized by the MoAbs and PCR-RFLP results among the non-human primates shows considerable conservation of the DO gene. The difficulties we encountered with the amplification of DNA from the non-human primates lower in the phylogenetic tree are probably due to divergence in sequence."

Subsequently until May 7, 2003, a total of 143 cases were recorded in the Mbomo and Kelle health districts including 129 fatalities. Thirteen cases were laboratory confirmed and 130 were epidemiologically linked. Fifty-three percent of patients were male. Age ranged form 5 days to 80 years. Transmission involved direct contact with an infected person especially within families. Epidemiological data traced introduction of Ebola virus into the population to three primary cases mainly involving hunters. In all three cases development of the disease followed contact with non-human primates (gorillas) and other mammals (antelope) that had either been killed or found dead. Three health care workers were infected during the epidemic but nosocomial transmission played a minor role in the epidemic. On June 5, the Minister of Health and Population of the Congo Republic officially declared that the outbreak of EHF was over in the Cuvette Ouest Region.

Claims on tourist revenue from a Ugandan National Park,"['Adams, WM', 'Infield, M']",WORLD DEVELOPMENT,10.1016/S0305-750X(02)00149-3,JAN 2003,49,"This paper discusses the competing interests in revenues derived from visitor wildlife tourism based on viewing the mountain gorilla (Gorilla gorilla beringei) in Mgahinga National Park, Uganda. Financial flows to local communities do reduce their sense of grievance at the park's creation, but do not compensate them for the costs of park creation. Different interests within and outside Uganda compete for wildlife tourism revenue and limit its capacity to fund the direct and indirect costs of gorilla conservation. The creation of multiscale multistakeholder partnerships for conservation built on revenue-sharing is a daunting institutional challenge. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

Variation of variable number of tandem repeat sequences in the 3 '-untransiated region of primate dopamine transporter genes that affects reporter gene expression,"['Inoue-Murayama, M', 'Adachi, S', 'Mishima, N', 'Mitani, H', 'Takenaka, O', 'Terao, K', 'Hayasaka, I', 'Ito, S', 'Murayama, Y']",NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS,10.1016/S0304-3940(02)01125-4,DEC 16 2002,42,"Genetic polymorphism has been reported in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the human dopamine transporter (DAT) gene and the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism has been proposed to be associated with normal personal traits or psychoneurological disorders. To assess the variation of this region in nonhuman primates, we amplified the VNTR regions by the polymerase chain reaction in several species of apes and monkeys, and determined their DNA sequences. The 3'-UTR of the chimpanzee DAT gene was also polymorphic and alleles with one or two unit(s) of a 40 bp sequence were found, while all gorillas and orangutans examined had only 2-repeat allele. Cynomolgus macaques and African green monkeys shared 11- or 12-repeat and 5-repeat alleles, respectively. By performing transient transfection assay, we found that most of the VNTR sequences of nonhuman primates exhibited higher activities on reporter gene assay as compared to those of human 9-, 10- and 11-repeat sequences.

Long bone articular and diaphyseal structure in old world monkeys and apes. I: Locomotor effects,"['Ruff, CB']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10117,DEC 2002,116,"The relationship between locomotor behavior and long bone structural proportions is examined in 179 individuals and 13 species of hominoids and cercopithecoids. Articular surface areas, estimated from linear caliper measurements, and diaphyseal section moduli (strengths), determined from CT scans, were obtained for the femur, tibia, humerus, radius, and ulna. Both within-bone (articular to shaft) and between-bone (forelimb to hindlimb) proportions were calculated and compared between taxa. It was hypothesized that: 1) species emphasizing slow, cautious movement and/or more varied limb positioning (i.e., greater joint excursion) would exhibit larger articular to cross-sectional shaft proportions, and 2) species with more forelimb suspensory behavior would have relatively stronger/larger forelimbs, while those with more leaping would have relatively stronger/larger hindlimbs. The results of the analysis generally confirm both hypotheses. Several partial exceptions can be explained on the basis of more detailed structural-functional considerations. Associations between locomotion and structural proportions can be demonstrated both across major groupings (hominoids and cercopithecoids) and between relatively closely related taxa, e.g., mountain and lowland gorillas, siamangs and gibbons, and Trachypithecus and other colobines. Furthermore, structure and function do not always covary with taxonomy. For example, compared to cereopithecoids, mountain gorillas have relatively larger joints, like other hominoids, but do not have relatively stronger forelimbs, unlike other hominoids. This is consistent with a locomotor repertoire emphasizing relatively slow movement but with very little forelimb suspension. Proportions of Proconsul nyanzae, Proconsul heseloni, Morotopithecus bishopi, and Theropithecus oswaldi are compared with modern distributions to illustrate the application of the techniques to fossil taxa.

Likelihood and Bayes estimation of ancestral population sizes in hominoids using data from multiple loci,"['Yang, ZH']",GENETICS,NA,DEC 2002,89,"Polymorphisms in an ancestral population can cause conflicts between gene trees and the species tree. Such conflicts can be used to estimate ancestral population sizes when data from multiple loci are available. In this article I extend previous work for estimating ancestral population sizes to analyze sequence data from three species under a finite-site nucleotide substitution model. Both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayes methods are implemented for joint estimation of the two speciation dates and the two population size parameters. Both methods account for uncertainties in the gene tree due to few informative sites at each locus and make an efficient use of information in the data. The Bayes algorithm using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) enjoys a computational advantage over ML and also provides a framework for incorporating prior information about the parameters. The methods arc applied to a data set of 53 nuclear noncoding contigs from human, chimpanzee, and gorilla published by Chen and Li. Estimates of the effective population size for the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees by both ML and Bayes methods are similar to12,000-21,000, comparable to estimates for modern humans, and do not support the notion of a dramatic size reduction in early human populations. Estimates published previously from the same data are several times larger and appear to be biased due to methodological deficiency. The divergence between humans and chimpanzees is dated at similar to5.2 million years ago and the gorilla divergence 1.1-1.7 million years earlier. The analysis suggests that typical data sets contain useful information about the ancestral population sizes and that it is advantageous to analyze data of several species simultaneously."
"Evidence for a fast, intrachromosomal conversion mechanism from mapping of nucleotide variants within a homogeneous alpha-satellite DNA array","['Schindelhauer, D', 'Schwarz, T']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.451502,DEC 2002,38,"Assuming that patterns of sequence variants within highly homogeneous centromeric tandem repeat arrays can tell us which molecular turnover mechanisms are presently at work, we analyzed the a-satellite tandem repeat array DXZI of one human X chromosome. Here we present accurate snapshots from this dark matter of the genome. We demonstrate stable and representative cloning of the array in a P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) library, use samples of higher-order repeats subcloned from five unmapped PACs (120-160 kb) to identify common variants, and show that such variants are presently in a fixed transition state. To characterize patterns of variant spread throughout homogeneous array segments, we use a novel partial restriction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis mapping approach. We find an older large-scale (35-50 kb) duplication event supporting the evolutionarily important unequal crossing-over hypothesis, but generally find independent variant occurrence and a paucity of potential de novo mutations within segments of highest homogeneity (99.1%-99.3%). Within such segments, a highly nonrandom variant clustering within adjacent higher-order repeats was found in the absence of haplotypic repeats. Such variant clusters are hardly explained by interchromosomal, fixation-driving mechanisms and likely reflect a fast, localized, intrachromosomal sequence conversion mechanism."
Factor analysis of multiple measures of hand use in captive chimpanzees: An alternative approach to the assessment of handedness in nonhuman primates,"['Wesley, MJ', 'Fernandez-Carriba, S', 'Hostetter, A', 'Pilcher, D', 'Poss, S', 'Hopkins, WD']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1021114518028,DEC 2002,16,"We tested whether chimpanzee handedness could be characterized as either unidimensional or multidimensional when considered across multiple measures of hand use. We determined for each of 6 different tasks in a sample of 105 captive chimpanzees hand preferences, and subjected the individual hand preference scores to a factor analysis. Five of the 6 tasks loaded on two separate factors that accounted for 54% of the variance. To assess population-level handedness, we calculated handedness indices for the loadings on each factor, for the item loadings across all factors, and for all tasks including ones that did not load on any factor. There is significant population-level right handedness for all 4 indices, which suggests that chimpanzee handedness is multidimensional and not task specific."
Affiliation among females in wild Hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas hamadryas),"['Swedell, L']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1021170703006,DEC 2002,48,"Previous researchers of hamadryas baboons have described a star-shaped sociogram, whereby the strongest social bonds within hamadryas one-male units are between a leader male and his females and bonds among females are weak by comparison. This type of social organization is also known as cross-bonding to distinguish it from the female-bonding found in most papionin monkeys. Models of female primate socioecology suggest that hamadryas baboons lack female bonding due to their reliance on scarce, widely-dispersed food resources. Here, I report observational data from a wild population of hamadryas baboons in Ethiopia indicating that, while females varied widely in their frequency of social interaction with other females, most females spent about as much social time with other females as they did with the leader male and some females even crossed unit boundaries to interact with one another. The size of a unit was positively correlated with the tendency of its females to interact with other females and was negatively correlated with the tendency of its females to interact with the leader male. Females were equally likely to spend social time with other females whether or not the leader male was available for social interaction at the time. Overall, this study suggests that a star-shaped sociogram does not characterize all hamadryas baboons and that female hamadryas may be, to some extent, female-bonded as well as cross-bonded. The lack of more pronounced female bonding in hamadryas is probably due to the behavior of males rather than to ecological factors."
Influencing western gorilla nest construction at Mondika Research Center,"['Mehlman, PT', 'Doran, DM']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1021126920753,DEC 2002,31,"We collected nesting data from 512 fresh nest sites, including 3725 individual nests, of western gorillas at the Mondika Research Site, Central African Republic and Republic of Congo from 1996 through mid-1999. The mean count of nests of weaned individuals is 7.4 per nest site. Nest types included bare earth with no construction (45% of total), partial to full ground construction (34%), and arboreal (21%). Females, blackbacks, and juveniles as a combined age-sex class built significantly more arboreal nests (21% of total) than silverbacks did (2%). Proximate rainfall (independent of temperature) is significantly correlated with nest construction, i.e., as rainfall increased, silverbacks built more ground nests, and non-silverbacks built more ground and arboreal nests. Maximum daily temperature (independent of rainfall) is significantly negatively correlated with nest construction, i.e., as temperature increased, gorillas slept more often on bare earth without constructing a nest. Accordingly, we conclude that although nest building in gorillas may have innate components shared with other great apes, it is a flexible behavioral pattern that in some western populations is often not exhibited. It appears that when gorillas in this population build nests, they do so in response to both wet and cool conditions, and independently of diet, ranging, or group size."
Quantifying temporal bone morphology of great apes and humans: an approach using geometric morphometrics,"['Lockwood, CA', 'Lynch, JM', 'Kimbel, WH', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFRICANUS']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00122.x,DEC 2002,58,"The hominid temporal bone offers a complex array of morphology that is linked to several different functional systems. Its frequent preservation in the fossil record gives the temporal bone added significance in the study of human evolution, but its morphology has proven difficult to quantify. In this study we use techniques of 3D geometric morphometrics to quantify differences among humans and great apes and discuss the results in a phylogenetic context. Twenty-three landmarks on the ectocranial surface of the temporal bone provide a high level of anatomical detail. Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) is used to register (adjust for position, orientation and scale) landmark data from 405 adults representing Homo, Pan, Gorilla and Pongo. Principal components analysis of residuals from the GPA shows that the major source of variation is between humans and apes. Human characteristics such as a coronally orientated petrous axis, a deep mandibular fossa, a projecting mastoid process, and reduced lateral extension of the tympanic element strongly impact the analysis. In phenetic cluster analyses, gorillas and orangutans group together with respect to chimpanzees, and all apes group together with respect to humans. Thus, the analysis contradicts depictions of African apes as a single morphotype. Gorillas and orangutans lack the extensive preglenoid surface of chimpanzees, and their mastoid processes are less medially inflected. These and other characters shared by gorillas and orangutans are probably primitive for the African hominid clade."

In this study, we have used an L1 gene consensus PCR test designed to detect a broad spectrum of human skin papillomaviruses to analyze swab samples from healthy skin of 111 animals belonging to 19 vertebrate species. In eight of the species, papillomavirus DNA was found with the following prevalences: chimpanzees, 9 of 11 samples positive; gorillas, 3 of 4; long-tailed macaques, 14 of 16; spider monkeys, 2 of 2; ruffed lemurs, 1 of 2; cows, 6 of 10; European elks, 4 of 4; aurochs, 1 of 1. In total, 53 new putative animal papillomavirus types were found. The results show that skin papillomaviruses can be detected in healthy skin from many different animal species and are sufficiently related genetically to their human counterparts to be identified by a human skin papillomavirus primer set (FAP59 and FAP64)."

Classification trees as an alternative to linear discriminant analysis,"['Feldesman, MR']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10102,NOV 2002,41,"Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is frequently used for classification/prediction problems in physical anthropology, but it is unusual to find examples where researchers consider the statistical limitations and assumptions required for this technique. In these instances, it is difficult to know whether the predictions are reliable. This paper considers a nonparametric alternative to predictive LDA: binary, recursive (or classification) trees. This approach has the advantage that data transformation is unnecessary, cases with missing predictor variables do not require special treatment, prediction success is not dependent on data meeting normality conditions or covariance homogeneity, and variable selection is intrinsic to the methodology. Here I compare the efficacy of classification trees with LDA, using typical morphometric data. With data from modem hominoids, the results show that both techniques perform nearly equally. With complete data sets, LDA may be a better choice, as is shown in this example, but with missing observations, classification trees perform outstandingly well, whereas commercial discriminant analysis programs do not predict classifications for cases with incompletely measured predictor variables and generally are not designed to address the problem of missing data. Testing of data prior to analysis is necessary, and classification trees are recommended either as a replacement for LDA or as a supplement whenever data do not meet relevant assumptions. It is highly recommended as an alternative to LDA whenever the data set contains important cases with missing predictor variables. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
"Western lowland gorilla diet and resource availability: New evidence, cross-site comparisons, and reflections on indirect sampling methods","['Doran, DM', 'McNeilage, A', 'Greer, D', 'Bocian, C', 'Mehlman, P', 'Shah, N']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.10053,NOV 2002,100,"We describe the resource availability and diet of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from a new study site in the Central African Republic and Republic of Congo based on 3 years of study. The results, based on 715 fecal samples and 617 days of feeding trails, were similar to those reported from three other sites, in spite of differences in herb and fruit availability. Staple foods (consumed year-round) included high-quality herbs (Haumania), swamp herbs (when present), and a minimal diversity of fruit. A variety of fruits (average of 3.5 species per day and 10 per month) were selectively consumed; gorillas ignored some common fruits and incorporated rare fruits to a degree higher than predicted based on availability. During periods of fruit abundance, fruit constituted most of the diet. When succulent fruits were unavailable, gorillas used low-quality herbs (i.e., low-protein), bark, and more fibrous fruits as fallback foods. Fibrous fruit species, such as Duboscia macrocarpa and Klainedoxa gabonensis, were particularly important to gorillas at Mondika and other sites as fallbacks. The densities of these two species are similar across sites for which data are available, in spite of major differences in forest structure, suggesting they may be key species in determining gorilla density. No sex difference in diet was detected. Such little variation in western lowland gorilla diet across sites and between sexes was unexpected and may partly reflect limitations of indirect sampling.

Pan-African Sanctuary Alliance: Status and range of activities for great ape conservation,"['Farmer, KH']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.10054,NOV 2002,21,"While wild populations continue to decrease, the number of orphaned primates, sanctuaries, and attempts to reintroduce primates back to the natural environment are increasing. An umbrella organization called the Pan-African Sanctuary Alliance (PASA) was formed in 2000 and recently the IUCN Reintroduction Specialist Group developed a set of specific policy guidelines for primates (2002). Data presented in this report are based upon questionnaire responses by managers from 17 African facilities that have become members of PASA (membership in PASA is defined by attendance at an annual PASA workshop). These PASA facilities house over 500 great apes. (There may be other facilities not represented here simply because their managers did not attend a PASA workshop.) The majority of the apes arrived at the sanctuaries when they were less than 4 years old and half were confiscated. Over 40% were found awaiting sale, and 30% had been previously kept as pets. Common ailments upon arrival included internal parasites, behavioral abnormalities, and malnutrition; 20% of the total sanctuary population died prematurely. Most sanctuaries use a combination of enclosures surrounded by electric fencing and cages to accommodate the apes. Sanctuaries actively participate in conservation education, habitat protection, tourism, scientific data collection, local development, and reintroduction. The median total facility operating cost was US$65,000 per annum. The median facility cost per ape was US$2,222 per annum. Most funding comes from overseas nongovernmental agencies. Discussion focuses on evaluating the present status of sanctuaries, the problems facing them, and their potential role in African conservation issues. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
High frequency of Bacillus thuringiensis in feces of herbivorous animals maintained in a zoological garden in Japan,"['Lee, DH', 'Machii, J', 'Ohba, M']",APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY,NA,NOV 2002,11,"A total of 71 fecal samples, collected from 56 animal species (47 mammals, four reptiles, and five avians), were examined for the occurrence of Bacillus thuringiensis. Most of the animals were residents of the Fukuoka Municipal Zoo, Fukuoka, Japan. The organism was detected in 32 (45%) samples. Among 2,955 colonies of the Bacillus cereus/B. thuringiensis group examined, 531 (18%) were assigned to B. thuringiensis on the basis of the formation of parasporal inclusions. Fecal samples from animals feeding on vegetable matter contained B. thuringiensis at high frequencies. Examples included feces from the chimpanzee, gorilla, Japanese black bear, polar bear, green iguana, and ostrich. In contrast, only a few isolates were recovered from feces of carnivorous animals, in particular, feline mammalians including the lion, tiger, leopard, and jaguar. The results suggest that a daily food intake of plant origin yields the feces containing B. thuringiensis at high levels."
Genomic structure and evolution of the ancestral chromosome fusion site in 2ql3-2ql4.1 and paralogous regions on other human chromosomes,"['Fan, Y', 'Linardopoulou, E', 'Friedman, C', 'Williams, E', 'Trask, BJ']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.337602,NOV 2002,70,"Human chromosome 2 was formed by the head-to-head fusion of two ancestral chromosomes that remained separate in other primates. Sequences that once resided near the ends of the ancestral chromosomes are now interstitially located in 2ql3-2ql4.1. Portions of these sequences had duplicated to other locations prior to the fusion. Here we present analyses of the genomic structure and evolutionary history of >600 kb surrounding the fusion site and closely related sequences on other human chromosomes. Sequence blocks that closely flank the inverted arrays of degenerate telomere repeats marking the fusion site are duplicated at many, primarily subtelomeric, locations. In addition, large portions of a 168-kb centromere-proximal block are duplicated at 9pter, 9pll.2, and 9ql3, with 98%-99% average sequence identity. A 67-kb block oil the distal side of the fusion site is highly homologous to sequences at 22qter. A third -100-kb segment is 96% identical to a region in 2qll.2. By integrating data on the extent and similarity of these paralogous blocks, including the presence of phylogenetically informative repetitive elements, with observations of their chromosomal distribution in nonhuman primates, we infer the order of the duplications that led to their current arrangement. Several of these duplicated blocks may be associated with breakpoints of inversions that occurred during primate evolution and of recurrent chromosome rearrangements in humans."
Natural concepts in a juvenile gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at three levels of abstraction,"['Vonk, J', 'MacDonald, SE']",JOURNAL OF THE EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF BEHAVIOR,10.1901/jeab.2002.78-315,NOV 2002,33,"The extent to which nonhumans are able to form conceptual versus perceptual discriminations remains a matter of debate. Among the great apes, only chimpanzees have been tested for conceptual understanding, defined as the ability to form discriminations not based solely on simple perceptual features of stimuli, and to transfer this learning to novel stimuli. In the present investigation, a young captive female gorilla was trained at three levels of abstraction (concrete, intermediate, and abstract) involving sets of photographs representing natural categories (e.g., orangutans vs. humans, primates vs. nonprimate animals, animals vs. foods). Within each level of abstraction, when the gorilla had learned to discriminate positive from negative exemplars in one set of photographs, a novel set was introduced. Transfer was defined in terms of high accuracy during the first two sessions with the new stimuli. The gorilla acquired discriminations at all three levels of abstraction but showed unambiguous transfer only with the concrete and abstract stimulus sets. Detailed analyses of response patterns revealed little evidence of control by simple stimulus features. Acquisition and transfer involving abstract stimulus sets suggest a conceptual basis for gorilla categorization. The gorilla's relatively poor performance with intermediate-level discriminations parallels findings with pigeons, and suggests a need to reconsider the role of perceptual information in discriminations thought to indicate conceptual behavior in nonhumans."

This primer pair produces shorter D12S391 amplified fragments (104156 bp) than the primer pair originally described by Lareu et al. (209-261 bp). The detection system for the D12S391 locus using the new primer pair and capillary electrophoresis (CE) analysis was evaluated using various forensic samples. The typing results from 70 DNA samples using the new primer pair and the original primer pair were completely identical. One hundred twenty-five amplified fragments from D12S391 alleles were sized correctly within +/-0.25 by of the D12S391 allelic ladder. A rare allele, 19.3, previously found only in Caucasians, was found for the first time in a Japanese subject, and it was clearly distinguished from allele 20 by the CE analysis. This detection system was sensitive and could detect D12S391 types from 16 pg of genomic DNA, and from a minor component at a ratio of 1:10 in mixed samples. This system was more useful for the analysis of degraded DNA than was the method using the original primer pair, and could detect D12S391 types from bloodstains that had been stored for 26 years. In addition, the specificity of the method was demonstrated using nonhuman DNA."

Candidate indels were identified by comparison of overlapping genomic or cDNA sequences. Average confirmation rate for indels with a greater than or equal to2-nt allele-length difference was 58%, but the confirmation rate for indels with a 1-nt length difference was only 14%. The vast majority of the human diallelic indels were monomorphic in chimpanzees and gorillas. The ratio of deletion: insertion mutations was 4.1. Allele frequencies for the indels were measured in Europeans, Africans, Japanese, and Native Americans. New alleles were generally lower in frequency than old alleles. This tendency was most pronounced for the Africans, who are likely to be closest among the four groups to the original modern human population. Diallelic indels comprise similar to8% of all human polymorphisms. Their abundance and ease of analysis make them useful for many applications."

Using the HAPPY mapping method, an acellular adaptation of the radiation hybrid method, we mapped a few hundred markers on the human, chimpanzee, and gorilla genomes. This allowed us to identify several chromosome rearrangements, in particular a pericentric inversion and a translocation.

This study takes into account intraspecific variation to test whether or not the limb proportions of four early hominin associated skeletons (AL 288-1, OH 62, BOUNP-12/1, and KNM-WT 15000) can be considered to be significantly different. from one another. Exact randomization methods were used to compare the differences between pairs of fossil skeletons to the differences observed between all possible pairs of individuals within large samples of Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, and Homo sapiens. Although the difference in humerofemoral proportions between OH 62 and AL 288-1 does not exceed variation in the extant samples, it is rare. When humerofemoral midshaft circumferences are compared, the difference between OH 62 and AL 288-1 is fairly common in extant species. This, in combination with error associated with the limb lengths estimates, suggests that it may be premature to consider H. (or Australopithecus) habilis as having more apelike limb proportions than those in A. afarensis. The humerofemoral index of BOU-VP-12/1 differs significantly from both OH 62 and AL 288-1, but not from KNM-WT 15000. Published length estimates, if correct, suggest that the relative forearm length of BOU-VP-12/1 is unique among hominins, exceeding those of the African apes and resembling the proportions in Pongo. Evidence that A. afarensis exhibited a less apelike uppenlower limb design than A. africanus (and possibly H. habilis) suggests that, if A. afarensis is broadly ancestral to A. africanus, the latter did not simply inherit primitive morphology associated with arboreality, but is derived in this regard. The fact that the limb proportions of OH 62 (and possibly KNM-ER 3735) are no more humanlike than those of AL 288-1 underscores the primitive body design of H. habilis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Testing of fecal samples of gorillas (n=100), people sharing gorilla habitats (n=62), and local pre- and postweaned cattle (n=50) having access to these habitats with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibodies revealed Giardia duodenalis cysts at prevalences of 2, 5, and 10%, respectively. The identification of G. duodenalis was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization with 2 species-specific 18-bp oligonucleotide probes conjugated to hexachlorinated 6-carboxyfluorescein. The mean pathogen concentration was 2.5, 2.8, and 0.2x10(4) cysts/g of the gorilla, people, and cattle feces, respectively. All cyst isolates aligned with genotype (assemblage) A, as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of a 130-bp region near the 5' end of the small subunit-ribosomal RNA gene. A single genotype (assemblage) A recovered from 3 genetically distant but geographically united host groups indicates anthropozoonotic transmission of G. duodenalis. A large percentage of the local community does not follow park regulations regarding the disposal of their fecal waste, as self-reported in a questionnaire. This genotype may have been introduced into gorilla populations through habituation activities and may have then been sustained in their habitats by anthropozoonotic transmission."

The function of male aggressive displays towards females in mountain gorillas,"['Sicotte, P']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02629603,OCT 2002,9,"In groups of Gorilla g. beringei, male aggression towards females regularly takes the form of male display. This paper examines male display towards females in two Karisoke study groups (Group 5 and Group BM) in 1989, a period when none of the females were new immigrants. Results are based on 259 hr of focal observations and 121 hr of ad libitum observations on male behaviors towards females. The goal is to see if the data are compatible with four non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to explain male displays towards females: (1) demonstration of male fighting abilities to influence female long term residence decision; (2) decrease potential competitive inequities between females; (3) provision to females of an occasion to confirm their subordinance to a male; and (4) short term influence on mating. First, male-female proximity was tested against proportion of male displays, to rule out the possibility that males display towards females simply because they happen to be close by. There was no association between proximity and male display. Dominant males were responsible for a higher proportion of displays than subordinate males. This is consistent with the idea that males display to demonstrate their fighting abilities, or their qualities as protector, since dominant males are the ones offering long term protection against infanticide and predators. Females that were in a position to transfer did not receive a higher proportion of male display, however. Long term resident dominant females received a higher proportion of displays from the dominant males, which is consistent with the idea that males attempt to decrease potential competitive inequities between females. There was an association between female appeasement reactions and male displays, which suggests that males display to create occasions for the females to confirm their subordinance to them. Estrous females did not receive a higher proportion of male displays, and there was no association between male display and copulation, suggesting that male displays are not a form of courtship aggression aimed at influencing mating in the short term."
Molecular evolution of IgG subclass among nonhuman primates: Implication of differences in antigenic determinants among apes,"['Asada, Y', 'Kawamoto, Y', 'Shotake, T', 'Terao, K']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02629608,OCT 2002,2,"The cross-reactivity of five different rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human IgG and IgG subclass (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) was determined by competitive ELISA with nine nonhuman primate species including five apes, three Old World monkeys, and one New World monkey. As similar to those previously reported, the reactivity of anti-human IgG antibody with plasma from different primate species was closely related with phylogenic distance from human. Every anti-human IgG subclass antibody showed low cross-reactivity with plasma from Old World and New World monkeys. The plasma from all apes except for gibbons (Hylobates spp.) showed 60 to 100% of cross-reactivity with anti-human IgG2 and IgG3 antibodies. On the other hand, chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus) and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) plasma showed 100% cross-reactivity with anti-human IgG I antibody, but gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and gibbon plasma showed no cross-reactivity. The chimpanzee and gorilla plasma cross-reacted with anti-human IgG4 antibody at different reactivity, 100% in chimpanzee and 50% in gorilla, but no cross-reactivity was observed in orangutan and gibbon plasma. These results suggest the possibilities that the divergence of ""human-type"" IgG subclasses might occur at the time of divergence of Homo sapience from Hylobatidae, and that the molecular evolution of IgG1 as well as IgG4 is different from that of IgG2 and IgG3 in great apes, this is probably caused by different in development of immune function in apes during the course of evolution."

Inactivation of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase occurred prior to brain expansion during human evolution,"['Chou, HH', 'Hayakawa, T', 'Diaz, S', 'Krings, M', 'Indriati, E', 'Leakey, M', 'Paabo, S', 'Satta, Y', 'Takahata, N', 'Varki, A']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.182257399,SEP 3 2002,154,"Humans are genetically deficient in the common mammalian sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) because of an Alu-mediated inactivating mutation of the gene encoding the enzyme CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) hydroxylase (CMAH). This mutation occurred after our last common ancestor with bonobos and chimpanzees, and before the origin of present-day humans. Here, we take multiple approaches to estimate the timing of this mutation in relationship to human evolutionary history. First, we have developed a method to extract and identify sialic acids from bones and bony fossils. Two Neandertal fossils studied had clearly detectable Neu5Ac but no Neu5Gc, indicating that the CMAH mutation predated the common ancestor of humans and Neandertals, approximate to0.5-0.6 million years ago (mya). Second, we date the insertion event of the inactivating human-specific sahAluY element that replaced the ancestral AluSq element found adjacent to exon 6 of the CMAH gene in the chimpanzee genome. Assuming Alu source genes based on a phylogenetic tree of human-specific Alu elements, we estimate the sahAluY insertion time at approximate to2.7 mya. Third, we apply molecular clock analysis to chimpanzee and other great ape CMAH genes and the corresponding human pseudogene to estimate an inactivation time of approximate to2.8 mya. Taken together, these studies indicate that the CMAH gene was inactivated shortly before the time when brain expansion began in humankind's ancestry, approximate to2.1-2.2 mya. In this regard, it is of interest that although Neu5Gc is the major sialic acid in most organs of the chimpanzee, its expression is selectively down-regulated in the brain, for as yet unknown reasons."

A total of 171 food items were identified, among which 156 items were plant materials belonging to 114 species from 57 taxonomic families. Chimpanzees consumed 66 species of fruits (62 species of pulps and four species of seeds). Results of fecal analysis showed that fig fruits were the most frequently eaten. Their seeds occurred in 92% of a total of 7,212 chimpanzee fecal samples. The chimpanzees changed their diet according to seasonal and annual variations in both abundance and diversity of fruit species. However, they are very selective frugivores. Only a few pulp-fruit species are regularly identified in their fecal samples. During the rainy season, when ripe fruit was scarce, chimpanzees relied heavily on piths and leaves. They swallowed leaves of two species of Commelinaceae without chewing, probably for medical purposes. Animal foods were eaten infrequently. The montane forest of Kahuzi, where chimpanzees range up to 2,600 in above sea level, may be the highest altitudinal limit ever recorded for their distribution. Compared to other chimpanzee habitats, Kahuzi has a low diversity of fruit species and the availability of a few pulp-fruit species may be critical to the survival of Kahuzi chimpanzees.

Eleven gorilla mother-infant dyads were focally observed in weekly 1-hr sessions for 12 months. Spatial relationships were affected by age as well as by ambient temperature. Although the youngest infant was encouraged by its mother to walk and climb, mothers showed little or no encouragement in other contexts. In contrast, infants were quite interested in their mothers' activities, on some occasions repeated their mother's behavior, and actively encouraged their mothers to share food, play, or follow them. These findings suggest that gorilla infants are more active than their mothers in creating situations that are potentially conducive to the acquisition of knowledge or skills."
Contribution of homoplasy and of ancestral polymorphism to the evolution of genes in anthropoid primates,"[""O'hUigin, C"", 'Satta, Y', 'Takahata, N', 'Klein, J']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,SEP 2002,39,"Molecular phylogenies of lineages that split from one another in short succession are often difficult to resolve because different loci and different sites within the same locus yield incongruent relationships. The incongruity is commonly attributed to two causes: differential assortment of ancestral polymorphisms and homoplasy. To assess the relative contribution of these two causes, sequences of 57 segments from 51 loci in six primate lineages (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, macaque, and tamarin, abbreviated as H, C, G, O, M, and T, respectively) were subjected to ""partitioning"" analysis, in which phylogenetically informative sites were identified in all 15 pairwise comparisons of each of the 57 segments and tallied for their support or lack thereof for each of the theoretically possible phylogenies. The six lineages include one of the best known cases of a difficult-to-resolve phylogeny: the trichotomy (H, C, G), in which the three lineages may have diverged from each other within a short period of time. In this period many of the ancestral polymorphisms apparently persisted and yielded phylogenetically incongruent signals. By contrast, no ancestral polymorphism is expected to have survived during the interval separating the divergences of the O, M, and T lineages from the ancestor of the (H, C, G) group. Any phylogenetic incompatibilities at sites in the O, M, and T lineages relative to the (H, C, G) group are therefore presumably the result of homoplasy. The frequency of homoplasy estimated in this manner is unexpectedly high: 12% for the (H, C, G) clade and 19% for the (H, C, G, O) clade. At least three-quarters of the 48% incompatibility observed in the (H, C) clade is attributable to the sorting out of ancestral polymorphisms coupled with intragenic recombination. Possible reasons for this high level of homoplasy in the O, M, and T lineages are discussed, and a computer simulation has been carried out to produce a model explaining the observed data."

Isolates were obtained from 35 samples from 34 (9-4 per cent) of the cats, but not from any of the other animals. Comparison of citrate synthase gene sequences from the isolates indicated that they were all Bartonella henselae. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments indicated that 30 of the cats were infected solely with B henselae genotype II, two were infected solely with B henselae genotype I and two were infected with both genotypes."

The ability to develop articulate speech relies on capabilities, such as fine control of the larynx and mouth(1), that are absent in chimpanzees and other great apes. FOXP2 is the first gene relevant to the human ability to develop language(2). A point mutation in FOXP2 co-segregates with a disorder in a family in which half of the members have severe articulation difficulties accompanied by linguistic and grammatical impairment(3). This gene is disrupted by translocation in an unrelated individual who has a similar disorder. Thus, two functional copies of FOXP2 seem to be required for acquisition of normal spoken language. We sequenced the complementary DNAs that encode the FOXP2 protein in the chimpanzee, gorilla, orang-utan, rhesus macaque and mouse, and compared them with the human cDNA. We also investigated intraspecific variation of the human FOXP2 gene. Here we show that human FOXP2 contains changes in amino-acid coding and a pattern of nucleotide polymorphism, which strongly suggest that this gene has been the target of selection during recent human evolution."

Varied HIV-1 susceptibility and time to progression to AIDS have been associated with polymorphisms in CCR5. Many of these polymorphisms are located in the 5' cis-regulatory region of CCR5, suggesting that it may have been a target of natural selection. We characterized CCR5 sequence variation in this region in 400 chromosomes from worldwide populations and compared it to a genome-wide analysis of 100 AN polymorphisms typed in the same populations. Variation was substantially higher than expected and characterized by an excess of intermediate-frequency alleles. A genealogy of CCR5 haplotypes had deep branch lengths despite markedly little differentiation among populations. This finding suggested a deviation from neutrality not accounted for by population structure, which was confirmed by tests for natural selection. These results are strong evidence that balancing selection has shaped the pattern of variation in CCR5 and suggest that HIV-1 resistance afforded by CCR5 5' cis-regulatory region haplotypes may be the consequence of adaptive changes to older pathogens."

Leaf species varied in the extent to which physical defences made consumption difficult. In all, 96 distinct techniques for leaf processing were identified, but two species with defended leaves (Ficus asperifolia and F. exasperata ) required 2.5 as many techniques as did any of the six undefended species. Moreover, chimpanzees made more multiple leaf detachments, and made more subsequent modifications of the leaves, when dealing with the leaves of these two Ficus species, compared with the undefended leaf species. This greater complexity was associated with evidence of flexible, hierarchical organization of the process: iteration of modules consisting of several processing elements, facultative omission of modules, or substitutions of alternative modules. Comparison with data from mountain gorillas is made, and is consistent with similar cognitive architecture in the two species. We consider that, not only is hierarchical organization currently associated with mechanical difficulty in food processing, but that over evolutionary time-scales difficulties in food processing may have selected for cognitive advance."
Evolution of a VNTR located within the promoter region of the thiopurine methyltransferase gene: inferences from population and sequence data,"['Alves, S', 'Amorim, A', 'Prata, MJ']",HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s00439-002-0784-5,AUG 2002,4,"The promoter region of the human thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) gene contains a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) with three kind of motifs (A, B, and C) differing by the length of the unit core and nucleotide sequence. We have studied the structural variation within the VNTR alleles in two human populations and in samples from gorillas and chimpanzees. In humans, no intermingling of motifs was detected within the VNTR, and the sequences of the three core motifs remained remarkably unchanged, differences between alleles corresponding essentially to variations in the number of A and B repeats. The variation pattern in humans is consistent with an interpretation in which two contiguous genetic units (repeats A and B) behave evolutionarily according to the stepwise mutation model, as inferred from the population distribution profiles and from the molecular phylogenetic relationships among the VNTR alleles. However, the observation of a strong negative correlation between the numbers of A and B repeats also suggests that the regularity and/or independence of the mutational process has been disrupted to some extent by interactions between the A and B stretches. Selective pressure (the VNTR plays some role, although minor, in the TPMT function) or biased mutation are possible explanations. In gorillas and chimpanzees, several A-, B-, or C-like motifs were detected, but their arrangement within the VNTR alleles did not followed the regular pattern registered in humans and, particularly for the B-like motifs, a considerable sequence hypervariability was registered. Furthermore, the structural differences among non-human alleles were sufficiently numerous to render more plausible the assumption of the infinite allele model."

This sequence was contained in the bacterial artificial chromosome RP11-65J3, which in fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments on normal metaphases was found to detect, in addition to the predicted clear signal at 9q34, a faint but distinct signal at 22q11.2, where the BCR gene is located, suggesting the presence of a large region of homology between the two chromosomal regions. indeed, BLAST analysis of the RP11-65.13 sequence against the entire human genome revealed the presence of a stretch of homology, about 76 kb long, located approximately 150 kb 3' to the BCR gene, and containing the 126-bp insertion sequence. Evolutionary studies using fluorescence in situ hybridization identified the region as a duplicon, which transposed from the region orthologous to human 9q34 to chromosome 22 after the divergence of orangutan from the human-chimpanzee-gorilla common ancestor about 14 million years ago. Recent sequence analyses have disclosed an unpredicted extensive segmental duplication of our genome, and the impact of duplicons in triggering genomic disorders is becoming more and more apparent. The discovery of a large duplicon relatively close to the ABL and BCR genes and the finding that the 126-bp insertion is very close to the duplicon at 9q34 open the question of the possible involvement of the duplicon in the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome translocation."

The large human brain is an investment with initial costs and later rewards, which coevolved with increased energy allocations to survival. Not only does this theory help explain life history variation among primates and its extreme evolution in humans; it also provides new insight into the evolution of longevity in other biological systems.

We discuss its anthropological implications. Data on its histology, location, and population distribution (by age, race, and gender) are provided.

Microscopically, BtL is composed of well-organized dense lamellated bone which is poorly vascularized and with very few osteocytes. It forms a dome-shaped roof over an underlying diploeized area which includes the ectocranial table.

The frequency of BtL is similar in modern (37.6%) and archaeological (41.1%) populations, in blacks, whites, males, and females, and correlates with age. It is rare in nonhuman primates. Fifty-five percent of the human skulls studied by us had BtL only on the parietal, 23,6% on the frontal, and 3.6% on the occipital bones. Fifteen percent had BtL on both the frontal and parietal bones. No lateral preference was found. Most skulls with BtL (64.1%) had only one lesion, 20.4% had two BtL, and 15.4% demonstrated multiple BtL, The average number of button osteomas on an affected skull was 1.97. The frequency of large osteomas (0.5-1.0 cm) was similar in young and old age groups.

The demographic characteristics of BtL, mainly its high frequency among ancient and modern populations, its independence of sex and race, its scarcity in other primates, and the fact that its macro- and microstruture are indicative of an hamartoma (and not an osteoma or exostosis) suggest an evolutionary background to the phenomenon.

This type of intervention has seldom been analyzed in prosimians, although many of these species exhibit complex (multimale/multifemale) social organizations. The present study on captive brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus fulvus) shows that dominant individuals were more likely to intervene in conflicts. Both males and females intervened aggressively in conflicts. Female aggressive interventions occurred mainly on behalf of close kin, whereas males mainly intervened on behalf of juveniles. This study also provides the first record of neutral or peaceful interventions in lemurs. Although females intervened neutrally, almost all neutral interventions were by dominant males. Dominant males intervened in conflicts neutrally more often than agressively, principally in conflicts between adults and juveniles or between juveniles. Neutral interventions by males always ended the conflicts and were often followed by affiliative contacts between participants (intervenors and opponents). In lemurs, female interventions can be explained by kin selection, while the nature of dominant males' interventions suggests a control role. Interventions by males on behalf of juveniles may increase the formers' fitness. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Sexual harassment is the predominant feature of the mating strategy that subadult males pursue. This study investigated the countertactics that females employ to reduce sexual harassment by subadult males. I observed 207 copulations during more than 9,000 h of focal follows of wild Sumatran orangutans at the Suaq Balimbing Research Station over a 23-month period. Rates of copulations initiated by subadult males increased during months of high fruit abundance, and most mating attempts were directed toward females with weaned infants. Simultaneous harassment by multiple subadult males increased significantly during months of high fruit abundance, and nearly all adult female-adult male consortships occurred during periods of high fruit abundance. Females who maintained spatial association with adult males, either via consortship or by nonmating temporary parties, received lower rates of harassment, as measured by the success rate of subadult male mating attempts. Adult female-adult male parties did not always result in mating between the associating dyad. Female initiation of protective services by adult males is one social tactic that female orangutans employ to reduce sexual harassment. Females therefore receive direct services from adult males, which may be one factor that influences female mate choice in Surnatran orangutans."

Ten other sequences with a high level of homology to the KIAA1245 mRNA were found in the GenBank. The intron-exon structures were determined for all the sequences, and their exon sequences were compared. The comparison showed that they differ both in the extent of the exon homology and in the presence or absence of the HERV-K LTR in the third intron. The revealed sequences form a new gene family that comprises at least four subfamilies. Two of these subfamilies have the LTR, and the other two do not. We showed by PCR that the LTR was integrated into the introns after the divergence of the orangutan evolutionary branch from other hominoids but before the divergence of the gorilla branch, i.e., 8-13 million years ago.

"Identification of V1R-like putative pheromone receptor sequences in non-human primates. Characterization of V1R pseudogenes in marmoset, a primate species that possesses an intact vomeronasal organ","['Giorgi, D', 'Rouquier, S']",CHEMICAL SENSES,10.1093/chemse/27.6.529,JUL 2002,21,"The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is responsible in terrestrial vertebrates for the sensory perception of some pheromones, chemicals that elicit characteristic behaviors among individuals of the same species. Two multigene families (V1R, V2R) that encode proteins with seven putative transmembrane domains that are expressed selectively in different neuron subsets of the VNO have been described in rodents. Pheromone-induced behaviors and a functional VNO have been described in a number of mammals, but this sensory organ seems absent in adult catarrhines and apes, including humans. Until now, only pseudogenes have been isolated in humans, except one putative V1R (hV1RL1) sequence expressed in the main olfactory epithelium. We sought to isolate V1R-like genes in a New World monkey species, the marmoset Callithrix jacchus, that possesses an intact VNO and for which pheromone-induced behavior has been well documented. Using library screening approaches, we have identified five different sequences that exhibit characteristic features of V1R sequences, but that are non-functional pseudogenes. In an attempt to sort out functional V1R genes, we next cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the primate orthologues of hV1RL1. This approach was successful for gorilla, chimpanzee and orangutan, but not for the other species, including marmoset, probably because these species are too divergent from humans. Chimpanzee and orangutan V1RL1 genes are pseudogenes, whereas the gorilla counterpart is potentially functional. These observations raise the possibility that the V1R family has evolved in such a manner in mammals that every species that relies on a VNO-mediated sensory function possesses its own set of functional vomeronasal genes."

"The effect of structural preferences, temperature, and social factors on visibility in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla G-Gorilla)","['Stoinski, TS', 'Hoff, MP', 'Maple, TL']",ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR,10.1177/00116502034004005,JUL 2002,8,"Postoccupancy evaluations are common in determining successful design elements in the human setting, but they are rarely employed in zoological parks. The current study evaluated how structural preferences, temperature, and social factors affected the visibility of four groups of gorillas to the public. Although the majority of structures were located in visible portions of the exhibit, structures had a negative effect on visibility because of the gorillas' strong preference for a single type of structure (buildings) located primarily in nonvisible parts of the exhibits. Temperature and visibility were linearly related, with increasing temperatures corresponding with decreasing visibility. The removal of an animal from the group significantly affected the visibility of the remaining group members. The authors' results reinforce the need for exhibit designers to consider the relationships between animal behavior and environmental variables and to work with captive managers to create exhibits that meet the needs of individual animals."
A simple covarion-based approach to analyse nucleotide substitution rates,"['Siltberg, J', 'Liberles, DA']",JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00416.x,JUL 2002,34,"Using the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates (K-a/K-s) is a common approach for detecting positive selection. However, calculation of this ratio over a whole gene combines amino acid sites that may be under positive selection with those that are highly conserved. We introduce a new covarion-based method to sample only the sites potentially under selective pressure. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction over a phylogenetic tree coupled with calculation of K-a/K-s ratios, positive selection is better detected by this simple covarion-based approach than it is using a whole gene analysis or a windowing analysis. This is demonstrated on a synthetic dataset and is tested on primate leptin, which indicates a previously undetected round of positive selection in the branch leading to Gorilla gorilla."
Relative placement of the mandibular fossa in great apes and humans,"['Sherwood, RJ', 'Rowley, RB', 'Ward, SC']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.2002.0558,JUL 2002,5,"Several researchers have investigated, or commented on, the relative placement of the hominin mandibular fossa with regard to brain expansion and masticatory function. Two confounding factors are identified in this previous work. First, a number of different measurement techniques have been applied, confusing comparisons between studies. Second, the effects of squamous thickening due to temporal bone pneumatization are shown to influence measurements based relative to the ectocranial margin of the skull.

To investigate the influence of these factors, a sample of adult human (n = 12), chimpanzee (n = 12), gorilla (n = 15), and orang-utan (n = 8) skulls from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, University of Wisconsin Zoology Museum, and University of Wisconsin Anthropology collections, were CT scanned. Coronal scans were horizontally aligned and measured on a personal computer using ImageF (NIH). To identify fossa placement, fossa breadth was measured as the projected distance in the coronal plane between the tip of the entoglenoid to lateral margin of the articular surface. A second distance, from the tip of the entoglenoid to a sagittal plane, tangent to the lateralmost margin of the endocranial surface was taken to indicate the extent of medial placement of the fossa.

By eliminating the influence of pneumatization, these data unambiguously confirmed the medial placement of the human fossa and show all great apes as having a laterally placed fossa. Similar measurements on three fossil hominins, KNM-BC I (Homo sp. indet.), OH 5 and KNM-ER 23000 (Paranthropus boisei) demonstrate that, while all specimens demonstrate a broad fossa, only KNM-BC I is characterized by a relatively medial placement while the latter two display lateral placement.

Genetic and functional analysis of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene promoter,"['Zatyka, M', 'Morrissey, C', 'Kuzmin, I', 'Lerman, MI', 'Latif, F', 'Richards, FM', 'Maher, ER']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS,10.1136/jmg.39.7.463,JUL 2002,21,"The VHL gatekeeper turnout suppressor gene is inactivated in the familial cancer syndrome von Hippel-Lindau disease and in most sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinomas. Recently the VHL gene product has been identified as a specific component of a SCF-like complex, which regulates proteolytic degradation of the hypoxia inducible transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2. pVHL is critical for normal development and mRNA expression studies suggest a role in nephrogenesis. Despite the importance of VHL in oncogenesis and development, little is known about the regulation of VHL expression. To investigate VHL promoter activity, we performed comparative sequence analysis of human, primate, and rodent 5 VHL sequences. We then proceeded to deletion analysis of regions showing significant evolutionary conservation between human and rat promoter sequences, and defined two positive and one negative regulatory regions. Analysis of specific putative transcription factor binding sites identified a functional Sp1 site, which was shown to be a regulatory element. Overlapping Sp1/AP2 sites were also identified and candidate E2F1 binding sites evaluated. Three binding sites for as yet unidentified transcription factors were mapped also. These investigations provide a basis for elucidating the regulation of VHL expression in development, the molecular pathology of epigenetic silencing of VHL in tumourigenesis, and suggest a possible link between Sp1, VHL, and nephrogenesis."

A total of 665.5 km of line transects was used for the census. Thirteen diurnal primate species including five endangered species (Gorilla g. gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Mandrillus sphinx, Colobus satanas, Cercocebus torquatus) were recorded in the Campo Forest, the greatest part of which is a logging concession. Cercopithecus nictitans (1.43 groups/km(2)), C. cephus (1.13 groups/km(2)), C. pogonias (0.81 groups/km(2)), and C. torquatus (0.51 groups/km(2)) occurred at medium frequencies compared to figures from other Central African study sites. Mandrill densities estimated (0.27 groups/km(2)) show that the area is very important for the conservation of this rare species. Guenon densities found inside areas with a high level of human activities did not differ significantly from densities estimated in areas with a lower level of human activities. C torquatus densities were significantly higher in the areas with a low level of human disturbance and encounter rates with Lophocebus albigena also indicate a preference of less disturbed areas. Mangabeys are thus likely to be adversely affected by human activities in the area. In the Ma'an Forest, which has not been logged yet, ten species were confirmed. The population densities of two guenons (C nictitans and C cephus) were estimated to be twice as high in the unlogged forest area as compared to the logged forest of Campo. Other species are rarer in the Ma'an Forest than in the Campo Forest. Although mangabeys are adversely affected by human activities, the results still indicate that selective logging may be compatible with the conservation of cercopithecids, if a reduced damage logging concept and antipoaching measures are implemented. Increased hunting activities following logging operations will definitely have a negative longterm impact on primate populations in the Campo-Ma'an area if no further, more effective conservation measures will regulate wildlife use in future."

Both DSCR9 and DSCR10 are expressed preferentially in testis and encode functionally unknown proteins with 149 and 87 amino acid residues, respectively. Zoo blot analysis suggested that both genes are exclusive to primate genomes such as chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, crab-eating monkey and African green monkey but are not present in other non-primate mammals including mouse, dog, cat, and chicken. Comparative genomic sequence analysis of DSCR9 and DSCR10 with the corresponding mouse syntenic region confirmed the lack of these genes in the mouse. These results strongly suggest that DSCR9 and DSCR10 have emerged as a new class of gene in the primate lineage during evolution."
Mineral content as a basis for food selection by western lowland gorillas in a forest clearing,"['Magliocca, F', 'Gautier-Hion, A']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.10034,JUN 2002,33,"The forests in northwest Republic of Congo contain a number of herbaceous swamp clearings that provide foraging sites for lowland gorillas (G.g. gorilla). A 10-month study at the Maya Nord clearing (Parc National d'Odzala) showed that feeding activities occupied 72% of the time visiting gorillas spent on the clearing. They fed on four plant species: Enydra fluctuans (Asteraceae), Cyperits sp., Pycreus mundtii, and Rhynchospora corymbosa (Cyperaceae) among the 45 species recorded on the clearing. These clearing food species have higher mineral contents (especially Na and Ca) than the dominant Marantaceae species (Haumania liebrechtsiana) that constituted a staple food plant for gorillas in this forest. They also have higher potassium contents and contain less lignin than non-eaten clearing items/species. Finally,the most actively searched for clearing food (Enydra fluctuans) was characterized by the highest amount of Na and Ca. These results suggest that the mineral content (especially in Na, Ca, and/or K) could determine the feeding selectivity of gorillas at the clearing. They also tend to confirm that the amount of fiber plays a deterrent role in food selectivity, as has been found by many authors. The high density of gorillas in that region could result from the combination of the large areas of Marantaceae forests that provide abundant though monotonous food, and the number of clearings that provide sufficient mineral supplies. Clearings should thus be considered as key habitats for the conservation of gorillas. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

The gorilla was accurate on 70% of the short retention-interval trials and on 82% of the long retention-interval trials.

Patterns of gazing in orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus),"['Kaplan, G', 'Rogers, LJ']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1014913532057,JUN 2002,32,"Eyes play an important role in communication amongst humans and animals. However, relatively little is known about specific differences in eye morphology amongst primates and how these features might be associated with social structure and direction of gaze. We present a detailed study of gazing and eye morphology-exposed sclera and surrounding features-in orangutans. We measured gazing in rehabilitating orangutans in two contexts: interspecific viewing of the experimenter (with video camera) and intraspecific gazing (between subjects). Our findings show that direct staring is avoided and social looking is limited to certain age/social categories: juveniles engage in more looking at other orangutans than do adults or infants. While orangutans use eye movements in social communication, they avoid the snore prolonged mutual gaze that is characteristic of humans, and also apparent in chimpanzees and gorillas. Detailed frame-by-frame analysis of videotapes from field and zoo studies of orangutans revealed that they pay visual attention to both human observers and conspecifies by glancing sideways, with the head turned at an angle away from the subject being observed. Mutual gaze was extremely rare, and we have observed only two incidences of gaze following. Orangutans in captivity appear to use a more restricted pattern of gazes compared to free-living, rehabilitating ones, possibly suggesting the presence of a pathological condition (such as depression) in the captive subjects. Our findings have implications for further investigations of social communication and cognition in orangutans."
Effects of manual disability on feeding skills in gorillas and chimpanzees,"['Byrne, RW', 'Stokes, EJ']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1014917600198,JUN 2002,15,"Foraging gorillas and chimpanzees employ skilful bimanual techniques to process food plants, and there are wild populations in which 10-20% of individuals have severe hand injuries. We examined the feeding skills of one injured gorilla and two injured chimpanzees, while they dealt with plants for which intact peers employ complex techniques. Feeding efficiency was only slightly compromised in the disabled subjects, and none of them had acquired novel techniques specific to their remaining capacity. Instead, all three subjects used techniques like those of able-bodied individuals, though when several optional methods were available, their balance of preference was different. They adapted the techniques to their disabilities by the flexible substitution of a range of alternative means to achieve each step of the process, including unusual grips, use of one hand instead of two or vice versa, and use of the mouth or a foot. Compensation was at the level of detailed execution rather than overall technique and depended on transferring motor organization to novel effector organs. Our findings have implications for theories of the acquisition of complex manual skills in great apes and for the flexibility of great ape mental skills."

We examined fecal samples for eggs, larvae, proglottids, cysts, amoeba, trophozoites, and flagellates. For helminths, strongylates were most prevalent, infecting 82-94% of nonhuman primates (NH) and 30-93% of human (H) groups, followed by ascaroids (14-88% NH; 0-15% H), and threadworms (0-22% NH; 0-29% H). For protozoa, Entamoeba histolytica (2-100% NH; 33-52% H) and trichomonads (11-88% NH; 0-54% H) were most prevalent. Among gorilla samples (n = 156) there were significant age/sex differences in EPG/PPG for strongylates, threadworms, Entamoeba histolytica, and trichomonads, with infants exhibiting the highest mean EPG/PPG for all parasites except trichomonads. Between group analyses revealed that the Ba'Aka had significantly higher mean EPG of strongylates, ascaroids and threadworms than all other primate groups, except the mangabeys. For Entamoeba histolytica, E. colt, Balantidium coli, arid Iodamoeba butschlii, the agile mangabeys had significantly higher mean PPG than other groups; for trichomonads, the chimpanzees, and mangabeys had the highest mean PPG. Relative to other African ape sites, the gorillas and chimpanzees at Mondika appear to have high prevalences of intestinal parasites. This may be the result of the high proportion of swamp and seasonally,flooded areas, which provide optimal viability for parasite eggs and ova. At Mondika, the significantly higher parasite levels of Ba'Aka probably result from more traditional methods of hygiene and lack of available medical treatment. All workers at research sites should be monitored and treated to minimize cross-transmission between humans and local fauna."
"Winter feeding tree choice in Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellanae) in Shennongjia nature reserve, China","['Li, YM', 'Stanford, CB', 'Yang, YH']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,NA,JUN 2002,16,"We investigated patterns of winter feeding tree choice in 4 groups of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellanae) in Shennongjia Nature Reserve, China. We collected data during 2 winters from 1998 to 2000. The monkeys used mature forest, young forest and shrub forest, but not grassland. Groups used tree species in a significantly nonrandom pattern. There was a similar composition of preferred tree species between different habitats for each. group and among the same habitat types for different groups. They preferred Abies fargesii, Pinus armandii and Salix walliciana for foraging. The 3 species occur in varying degrees of abundance in different habitats and were used differently by the 4 groups The difference is probably due to interhabitat differences in availability of tree species, in addition to micro-climate. The mean circumference of a tree had little effect on its preference score, but preferred species tend to be larger. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated that the percentage of trees used and average number of feeding bites per tree is significantly greater for larger trees. For all trees in a given habitat, the percentage of trees used and average number of bites per tree have a significant positive correlation with average tree circumference. Our results indicate that Rhinopithecus roxellanae prefer to feed in large trees more than small trees in a given habitat, thereby preferring mature forest habitat. There is also a group-size effect; larger groups used higher-duality habitats than those of smaller groups. Both tree species and size are the major determinants of feeding choice, but tree species is more important than tree size. Our results have at least three implications for winter habitat conservation of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys. Conservation efforts should be focused on mature forest because it is better habitat at Rhinopithecus than young forest, as long as the same tree species are present. Secondly, Pinus armandii, Abies gargesii and Salix walliciana should be conserved as top priority in forest communities. Third, the largest trees in each habitat should be given greatest possible protection."

Based on all-occurrences of feeding bouts and 15-min point samples, the adult female had significantly higher daily dietary diversity indices than those of males. The female also fed at significantly lower heights than. the males did. There are also significant differences between age classes with the subadult male exhibiting the lowest dietary diversity and feeding at the greatest heights. During feeding, the female stayed in closest proximity to both juveniles, whereas adult males were peripheral. In contrast, the males moved closer in proximity to the female when resting and traveling. These sex differences could be explained 1) by the metabolic cost of reproduction for females, 2) as strategies to mitigate the cost of feeding competition between males and females, 3) by male role performance as a predator detector, and 4) by different social priorities of males and females."
Identifying metameric variation in extant hominoid and fossil hominid mandibular molars,"['Hlusko, LJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.10051,MAY 2002,9,"Landmark data were collected from cross sections and occlusal images of mandibular molar crowns, and Euclidean distance matrix analysis (EDMA) was used to identify metameric morphological variation between the first and second mandibular molars of living taxa: Gorilla gorilla (n = 30), Pan troglodytes (n = 34), and Homo sapiens (n 26). Two patterns of metameric variation were identified, one unique to humans and the other shared by chimpanzees and gorillas. In order to assess the utility of this type of analysis for the interpretation of the hominid fossil record, 19 mandibular molars from Sterkfontein Member 4, South Africa, were examined. The pattern of metameric variation of the Sterkfontein molars resembled that of the African great apes, and differed from the modern human pattern. These results demonstrate that data on metameric variation may provide information regarding function or developmental processes previously indiscernible from fossil material.

Common alleles shared among populations, alleles specific to geographically defined populations, and the homologous alleles, in the common and pygmy chimpanzee, the gorilla and the orangutan, were sequenced to define the allelic variation at the nucleotide level. These data reveal a common set of alleles shared among world populations, presumed to have arisen from a great ape ancestral allele prior to the divergence of the major geographical subdivisions of the human population, a subset of alleles specific to populations of African ancestry and a second set of alleles that arose by tandem duplication of the core repeat unit following the separation of African and non-African populations. These findings emphasize the complex evolutionary history of this locus and raise cautions about the pooling of alleles at this locus in association studies."

In this case, one may use the stem-lineage method for estimating divergence times. However, the estimates obtained by this method are often similar to those obtained by the linearized tree method. Application of these methods to a dataset of 104 proteins from several vertebrate species indicated that the divergence times between humans and mice and between mice and rats are about 96 and 33 million years (MY) ago, respectively. These estimates were obtained by assuming that birds and mammals diverged 310 MY ago. Similarly application of the methods to the protein sequence data from primate species indicated that the human lineage separated from the chimpanzee, gorilla, Old World monkeys, and New World monkeys about 6.0, 7.0, 23.0, and 33.0 MY ago, respectively. In this case the use of two calibration points, that is, the divergence time (13 MY ago) between humans and orangutans and between primates and artiodactyls (90 MY ago) gave essentially the same estimates."
Another look at shape variation in the distal femur of Australopithecus afarensis: implications for taxonomic and functional diversity at Hadar,"['Lague, MR']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.2002.0545,MAY 2002,20,"Previous studies have recognized two patterns of distal femoral morphology among the specimens from Hadar (Ethiopia) assigned to Australopithecus afarensis. Size and shape differences between the well preserved large (AL 333-4) and small (AL 129-1a) distal femora have been used to invoke both taxonomic and functional differences within the A. afarensis hypodigm. Nevertheless, prior studies have not analyzed these specimens in a multivariate context, nor have they compared the pattern of shape differences between the fossils to patterns of sexual dimorphism among extant taxa (i.e., the manner in which males and females differ). This study reexamines morphometric differences between the above specimens in light of observed levels of variation and patterns of sexual dimorphism among extant hominoids.

Eight extant reference populations were sampled to provide a standard by which to consider size and shape differences between the fossils. Samples include three populations of modern humans, two subspecies of Pan troglodytes, three subspecies of Gorilla gorilla, Pan paniscus, and Pongo pygmaeus. Using size ratios and scale-free ""shape"" data (both derived from 2-D coordinate landmarks), size and shape differences between the fossils were evaluated against variation within each reference population using an exact randomization procedure. Growth Difference Matrix Analysis (GDMA) was used to test whether the pattern of morphological differences between the fossils differs significantly from patterns of sexual dimorphism observed among the ten extant groups. Overall morphometric affinities of the fossils to extant taxa were explored using canonical variates analysis (CVA).

Results of the randomization tests indicate that the size difference between the Hadar femora can be easily accommodated within most hominoid taxa at the subspecific level (though not within single-sex samples). In addition, the magnitude of shape differences between the fossils can be commonly sampled even within most single-sex samples of a single hominoid subspecies. The pattern of morphological differences between the fossils does not differ statistically from any average pattern of femoral shape dimorphism observed among living hominoids. Moreover, contrary to prior claims, and despite a size disparity between the fossils greater than is typically observed within some chimpanzee and human populations, the two Hadar fossils appear to be much more similar to one another in overall shape than either specimen is to any extant hominoid group.

"Primate hepatitis B viruses - genetic diversity, geography and evolution","['Robertson, BH', 'Margolis, HS']",REVIEWS IN MEDICAL VIROLOGY,10.1002/rmv.348,MAY-JUN 2002,44,"There are six well characterised genotypes (A-F) of human hepatitis B virus that have distinct geographic ranges which generally relate to chronic HBV infection. A seventh human genotype (G) has recently been described, but there is limited information on ethnic and geographic distribution. Despite the fact that early studies indicated that HBV antigens were present in other primates, the prevailing dogma that HBV was a human disease precluded alternative explanations. Within the past 5 years, hepatitis B viruses have been characterised from all the Old World great apes (orangutan, gibbons, gorillas and chimpanzees) and from a New World woolly monkey. Each group of non-human primates appears to have a distinct strain of hepatitis B virus that can be distinguished from human sequences based upon the nucleoticle sequence and selected amino acid changes in the viral proteins. The woolly monkey HBV is most divergent from other primate and human sequences, while the great ape HBV sequences cluster together with separate branches for each group.

Fossils with pongid features appear in Eurasia after c. 15 Mya, and fossils with hominid features appear in Africa after c. 10 Mya. Instead of the traditional savannah-dwelling hypothesis, we argue that a combination of fossil (including the newly discovered Orrotin, Ardipithecus and Kenyanthropus hominids) and comparative data now provides evidence showing that: (1) the earliest hominids waded and climbed in swampy or coastal forests in Africa-Arabia and fed partly on hard-shelled fruits and molluscs; (2) their australopith descendants in Africa had a comparable locomotion but generally preferred a diet including wetland plants; and (3) the Homo descendants migrated to or remained near the Indian Ocean coasts, lost most climbing abilities, and exploited waterside resources."

An observation platform at the edge of the clearing was used over a 3-yr period, with gorillas visible for 1,681 hr. Data are presented on 14 groups and seven solitary males. Mean group size (excluding solitary males) was 8.4 +/- SD 4.3, and did not differ significantly from most other gorilla studies. All groups at Mbeli contained only one fully mature male and did not show evidence of fission-fusion or regular subgrouping. All emigrating males that remained in the population became solitary, and ""bachelor"" groups were not observed. Methodological issues are raised, including the classification of multi-male groups, and the demographic profiles of other populations are discussed in the light of results from Mbeli.

Infections with an animal-adapted genotype (Genotype 2) of Cryptosporidium parvum were found in a human population in Uganda that shares habitats with free-ranging gorillas, from which the same genotype of C. parvum had been recovered previously. A high prevalence of disease was found in park staff members (21%) who frequently contact gorillas versus 3% disease prevalence in the local community. This indicates a zoonotic transmission cycle of this pathogen against which no effective prophylaxis or therapy exists. The results of the study questionnaire demonstrated a high percentage of people not undertaking appropriate precautions to prevent fecal-oral transmission of C. parvum in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park.

So far only the chromosome painting technique has been extensively used in studies of chromosomal evolution. This technique allows to detect only interchromosomal rearrangements. Human and Great Apes chromosomes basically differ by intrachromosomal rearrangements, in particular inversions; with chromosome painting it has just been possible to confirm the origin by fusion of human chromosome 2 and a reciprocal translocation in Gorilla, involving the homologous of chromosome 5 and 17. In order to verify intrachromosomal rearrangements in human chromosomal evolution, chromosome mapping of human loci in non-human primates is a useful approach. We mapped Miller-Diecker, Smith-Magenis and RARA loci localised on human chromosome 17, in Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, Macaca fascicularis and Cercopithecus aethiops. On the base of the obtained results it was possible to verify chromosomal rearrangements previously identified by banding, to achieve new informations about the controversial evolution of human chromosome 17, and to detect the occurrence of a paracentric inversion in the homologous in Cercopithecus aethiops."
"Patterns of human diversity, within and among continents, inferred from biallelic DNA polymorphisms","['Romualdi, C', 'Balding, D', 'Nasidze, IS', 'Risch, G', 'Robichaux, M', 'Sherry, ST', 'Stoneking, M', 'Batzer, MA', 'Barbujani, G']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.214902,APR 2002,134,"Previous studies have reported that about 85% of human diversity at Short Tandem Repeat (STR) and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) autosomal loci is due to differences between individuals Of the same population, whereas differences among continental groups account for only 10% of the overall genetic variance. These findings conflict with popular notions of distinct and relatively homogeneous human races, and may also call into question the apparent usefulness of ethnic classification in, for example, medical diagnostics. Here, we present new data oil 21 Alu insertions in 32 populations. We analyze these data along with three other large, globally dispersed data sets consisting of apparently neutral biallelic nuclear markers, as well as with a P-globin data set possibly subject to selection. We confirm the previous results for the autosomal data, and find a higher diversity among continents for Y-chromosome loci. We also extend the analyses to address two questions: (1) whether differences between continental groups, although small, are nevertheless large enough to confidently assign individuals to their continent on the basis of their genotypes; (2) whether the observed genotypes naturally cluster into continental or population groups when the sample source location is Ignored. Using a range of statistical methods, we show that classification errors are at best around 30% for autosomal biallelic polymorphisms and 27% for the Y chromosome. Two data sets suggest the existence of three and four major groups of genotypes worldwide, respectively, and the two groupings are inconsistent. These results suggest that, at random biallelic loci, there is little evidence, if any, of a clear subdivision of humans into biologically defined groups."
Complex SNP-based haplotypes in three human helicases: Implications for cancer association studies,"['Trikka, D', 'Fang, Z', 'Renwick, A', 'Jones, SH', 'Chakraborty, R', 'Kimmel, M', 'Nelson, DL']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.176702,APR 2002,17,"We have initiated a candidate gene approach to study variation and predisposition to cancer in the four major ethnic groups that constitute the U.S. population (African Americans, Caucasians, Hispanics, and Asians). We resequenced portions of three helicase genes (BLM, WRN, and RECQL) identifying a total of 37 noncoding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Haplotype inference predicted 50 haplotypes in BLM, 56 in WRN, and 47 in RECQL in a sample of 600 chromosomes. Approximately 10% of the predicted haplotypes were shared among all ethnic groups. Linkage disequilibrium and recombination effects showed that each locus has taken a diverse evolutionary path. Primate DNA analysis of the same loci revealed one human haplotype per gene shared with the great apes, indicating that the observed diversity occurred since the divergence of humans from the last common ancestor. In BLM, we confirmed the presence of a founder haplotype among Ashkenazi Jews homozygous for the blm(Ash) mutation. The cosegregating haplotype was seen in all (616) samples of Ashkenazi descent, whereas in the general population it has a low frequency (0.02) and was not found in African Americans. In WRN, ethnic samples were studied for their haplotype content and the presence or absence of six previously described coding SNPs (cSNPs). Hispanic individuals carrying two of these cSNPs showed a 60% increase In the frequency of a common haplotype (haplotype No. 28). In the pooled sample, no association was found. Because (1) the majority of the haplotypes are population specific and (2) the patterns of linkage disequilibrium, recombination, and haplotype diversity are markedly different between gene regions, these data show the importance of either ethnically matched controls or within-family-based disease-gene association studies."
Tandem duplication of the NF1 gene detected by high-resolution FISH in the 17q11.2 region,"['Gervasini, C', 'Bentivegna, A', 'Venturin, M', 'Corrado, L', 'Larizza, L', 'Riva, P']",HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s00439-002-0704-8,APR 2002,10,"The gene for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), mapping to 17q11.2, has one of the highest observed mutation rates, partially because of its large size and gene conversion primed by NF1 pseudogenes. We have previously shown by means of high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) that a number of the loci flanking the NF1 gene are duplicated, in agreement with the reported presence of NF1 repetitive sequences (REPs). We report a direct tandem duplication of the NF1 gene identified in 17q11.2 by high-resolution FISH. FISH on stretched chromosomes with locus-specific probes revealed the duplication of the NF1 gene from the promoter to 3'UTR, but with at least the absence of exon 22. Fiber FISH with P1 artificial and bacterial artifical chromosomes, including the NF1 5'UTR and 3'UTR and flanking regions, visualized the direct tandem duplication with a similar, but not identical, genomic organization of the NF1 duplicon copies. Duplication was probably present in the humanchimpanzee-gorilla common ancestor, as demonstrated here by the finding of the duplicated NF1 gene at orthologous chromosome loci. The NF1 intrachromosomal duplication may contribute to the high whole-gene mutation rate by gene conversion, although the functional activity of the NF1 copy remains to be investigated. Detection of the NFI duplicon by high-resolution FISH may pave the way to filling the gaps in the human genomic sequence of the pericentromeric 17q 11.2 region."
Food preferences among captive western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Remis, MJ']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1013837426426,APR 2002,34,"I used a zoological park setting to address food preferences among gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorill) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Gorillas and chimpanzees are different sizes, and consequently, have been traditionally viewed as ecologically distinct. Sympatric western gorillas and chimpanzees have proved difficult to study, in the wild. Limited field data have provided conflicting information about whether gorillas are fundamentally, different from Chimpanzees in diet and behavior. Fruit eating shapes the behavior of most apes, but it is unclear whether the large-bodied gorillas are an exception to this rule, specifically whether they tire less selective and more opportunistic fruit eaters than chimpanzees are. My research provides experimental observational data to complement field data and to better characterize the diets and food preferences of the African apes. Daring laboratory research at the San Francisco Zoological Gardens, I examined individual and specific differences in food preferences of captive gorillas and chimpanzees via experimental paired-choice food trials with, foods that varied in nutritional content. During the study, I offered 2500 paired-food choices to 6 individual gorillas and 2000 additional pairs to them as a group. I also proffered 600 food pairs to 4 individual chimpanzees Despite expectations of the implications of body size differences for diet, gorillas and chimpanzees exhibited similar food preferences. Both species preferred foods high in non-starch sugars and sugar-to-fiber ratios, and low in total dietary fiber. Neither species avoided foods containing tannins. These data support other suggestions of African apes sharing a frugivorous adaptation."
Taste responses to fructose and tannic acid among gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Remis, MJ', 'Kerr, ME']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1013827310497,APR 2002,19,"We investigated the taste responses to fructose and tannic acid compounds among 6 western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at the San Francisco Zoo. We presented the subjects with 12 reference concentrations of 3-300 mM fructose, paired with tap water in paired-choice experimental trials. We subsequently, presented them with tap water paired with 8 dilute concentrations of tannic acid (0.25-6 mM) dissolved in 100 mM fructose solutions and 8 concentrations (0.25-6 mM) dissolved in 300 mM fructose solutions. The gorillas exhibited a broadly, similar preference threshold for fructose (50 mM) to those of other nonhuman primate and human samples. The gorillas tolerated moderate levels of tanninc acid, especially when presented in a very sweet package. The depressing effect of tannic acid on the ingestion of fructose solutions appeared to increase progressively, with tannin concentration and was lower as fructose concentration increased. The inhibition threshold for tannic acid solutions was reached at 4 mM tannic acid in 100 mM fructose solution, and at 6 mM tannic acid in 300 mM fructose solutions. These results suggest that gorillas use sweetness as a criterion for food selection and regard those with moderate levels of tannins as palatable. Our findings corroberate food preference studies and nutritional analyses of wild gorilla foods indicating that they prefer sugary, foods and readily, consume ones containing moderate levels of tannins. Taste responses may,facilitate a flexible frugivorous/folivorous diet among gorillas."
"Factors affecting nesting site choice in chimpanzees at Tshibati, Kahuzi-Biega National Park: Influence of sympatric gorillas","['Basabose, AK', 'Yamagiwa, J']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1013879427335,APR 2002,30,"We recorded 310 fresh chimpanzee night nests at 72 nest sites to determine their choice of tree and site for nesting vis-a-vis the effects of sympatric gorillas. Chimpanzees did not use trees for nesting according to their abundance, but instead tended to nest in fruit trees that they, used as food sources. Nesting patterns of chimpanzees may vary with nesting group size, the type of vegetation, and fruit species eaten or not eaten by gorillas. When chimpanzees lodged as a small group in the secondary forest, they nested more frequently in trees bearing ripe fruits eaten only by, themselves than in those with fruit eaten also by gorillas. When they lodged as a large group in the primary forest, they nested more frequently in trees bearing ripe fruits eaten by both apes. Nest group size is positively correlated with the availability of preferred ripe fruits in secondary forest. These findings not only reflect the larger foraging groups at the large fruiting trees but also suggest that chimpanzees may have tended to occupy fruiting trees effectively by nesting in them and by forming large nest groups when the fruits attracted gorillas. Competition over fruits between gorillas and chimpanzees, due to their low productivity, in the montane forest of Kahuzi, may have promoted the chimpanzee tactics."
Detection of virus-like particles in the liver of black and white ruffed lemurs with hepatitis,"['Worley, MB', 'Stalis, IH']",JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES,NA,APR 2002,3,"Two young black and white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata variegata) died at the San Diego Zoo (San Diego, California, USA) with extensive liver lesions suggestive of acute viral infection. Immunoassays performed to detect hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers were negative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers overlapping the HBV core gene produced in amplicon of approximately 411 base pairs (bp) from serum DNA of a HBV-positive western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) but not from serum DNA of either lemur. Cesium chloride gradient fractions of liver homogenates from both lemurs contained a peak protein fraction with a density of 1.18 g/cm(3). Electron microscopic analysis of fraction contents, concentrated by ultracentrifugation, revealed numerous pleomorphic, spherical particles varying in diameter from 16-25 nm. In one of the lemurs, this peak fraction also contained a double-shelled virus-like particle 47-50 nm in diameter. The size, morphology, and density of these particles suggest they are members of the Hepadnaviridae, a group of hepatotropic DNA-genome viruses for which HBV is the prototype."
Habituating the great apes: the disease risks,"['Woodford, MH', 'Butynski, TM', 'Karesh, WB']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605302000224,APR 2002,77,"All six great apes, gorillas Gorilla gorilla and G, beringei, chimpanzees Pan troglodytes and R paniscus, and orang-utans Pongo pygmaeus and P, abehi, are categorized as Endangered on the 2000 IUCN Red List and face many threats to their continued existence in the wild. These threats include loss of habitat to settlement, logging and agriculture, illegal hunting for busameat and traditional medicine, the live ape trade, civil unrest and infectious diseases. The great apes are highly susceptible to many human diseases, some of which can be fatal while others can cause marked morbidity. There is increasing evidence that diseases can be transmitted from humans to free-living habituated apes, sometimes with serious consequences. If protective measures are not improved, ape populations that are frequently in close contact with people will eventually be affected by the inadvertent transmission of human diseases. This paper describes the risks, sources and circumstances of infectious disease transmission from humans to great apes during and consequent upon habituation for tourism and research, A major problem is that the regulations that protect habituated apes from the transmission of disease from people are often poorly enforced. Suggestions are made for improving the enforcement of existing regulations governing ape-based tourism, and for minimizing the risk of disease transmission between humans, both local people and international visitors, and the great apes."

The prevalence of cryptosporidiosis and giardiosis was 38% and 12%, respectively, with 10% concomitant infections. Shedding intensity varied from 130 to 450 oocysts/ g (mean of 215 oocysts/g) and from 110 to 270 cysts/g (mean of 156 cysts/g). Significantly more pre-weaned than post-weaned cattle were infected with either parasite, and the pre-weaned cattle shed significantly higher numbers of either parasite than the post-weaned cattle. Mathematical modeling indicated that the maximum prevalence of asymptomatic infections can reach approximately 80% for cryptosporidiosis and 35% for giardiosis in the sampled cattle. Because C. parvum and G. duodenalis recovered from cattle can infect people and gorillas, cattle that graze within the Bwindi Park should be considered as a significant reservoir of these anthro-pozoonotic parasites."

Original parameters, called elliptical Fourier descriptors, allowed for the quantification of the shape of an outline irrespective of its morphological complexity, and provided a precise individual characterization. The use of step by step reconstructions with an increasing number of harmonies allowed for demonstration of the morphological contributions of the elliptical Fourier descriptors, and relationships to precise anatomical features were established. The first harmonics (1st to 8th) described the general mandibular shape, and the later harmonics (8th to 14th) characterized accessory and finer morphological features. The proportion of individuals presenting significant sexual dimorphism was 97.1% in males and 91.7% in females, and after size normalization 84.1% in males and 81.2% in females. Even after removal of the size component, these results in regard to mandibular dimorphism remained better than those found by classical approaches; this could be due to the use of elliptical Fourier analysis which takes into account all the information of the mandibular outline. Compared to the size component, the shape component seemed to be more important in the sexual dimorphism of the human mandible than previously recognized. The present approach opens interesting anthropological and clinical perspectives for the characterization of mandibular morphology."
"Pneumatized spaces, sinuses and spongy bones in the skulls of primates.","['Preuschoft, H', 'Witte, H', 'Witzel, U']",Anthropologischer Anzeiger; Bericht uber die biologisch-anthropologische Literatur,NA,2002-Mar,28,"The earliest attempts to understand the ""pneumatized spaces"" in the skulls of primates in general were focussed on the hollow spaces and the epithelium which covers their surfaces. More recent approaches consider the sinuses as a means to optimise skull architecture. Still, many attempts to get hold of the meaning of the intriguing pneumatized spaces circle around the air filled volumes they enclose. Here, we would like to reverse the approach and focus our biomechanic interpretation on the walls surrounding the big, empty, or at least not mechanically resistant spaces, and their mechanical properties. As a working hypothesis, we consider not only the walls of the more or less closed cavities, or sinuses, but also the braincase, the orbits, and the nasal channel as thin-walled shells of which we know that they can carry surprisingly large loads with a minimum of material. Details of the wall's profiles fit with this approach. From the same viewpoint, the bubble-like, air-filled cavernous systems in the ethmoid or temporal bones, and the marrow-filled spongy substance in the upper jaw are looked at as honeycomb-structures, which provide mechanical properties that are biologically advantageous and allow the saving of weight."
Palaeoenvironments and hominoid evolution.,"['Pickford, Martin']",Zeitschrift fur Morphologie und Anthropologie,NA,2002-Mar,7,"One of the key features that separates humans and their closest relatives (extinct species of the genus Homo and Praeanthropus and the australopithecines Australopithecus and Paranthropus) on the one hand, from the other hominoids, on the other, is their obligate bipedal locomotion when on the ground. This major difference from the generally quadrupedal locomotion practiced by other hominoids (Pan, Gorilla, Pongo and many extinct lineages) is reflected in many parts of the body, including all the major bones in the legs, arms, trunk and cranium. Locomotion has thus been of major interest to those interested in human origins, evolution, classification and phylogeny. A major hurdle to studies of the origins of bipedalism concerns the paucity of African hominoid fossils between 15 Ma, when all the adequately known hominoids were quadrupedal (most were pronograde, but at least one lineage was orthograde), and 4.2 Ma by which time fully bipedal hominids were established in Africa. Examination of Old World geology and palaeontology reveals a great deal about the evolution of palaeoenvironments and faunas during this period, and it is suggested that hominids evolved bipedal locomotion at the same time that there was a fundamental reorganisation of faunas towards the end of the Miocene. This faunal turnover resulted in the establishment of faunal lineages of ""modern"" aspect in Africa at the expense of ""archaic"" lineages which either went extinct or suffered a diminution of diversity. Many of the ""modern"" lineages were adapted to open country habitats in which grass became a major component of the diet as shown by modifications in the cheek teeth. Hominoids, in contrast, retained their traditional diet but were obliged to forage over greater and greater areas in order to do so, and this tactic led to pressures to modify the locomotor system rather than the diet. If bipedal hominids originated during this period, then the family Hominidae (sensu stricto) dates from about 8-7 Ma."
Kinematics and ontogeny of locomotion in monkeys and human babies.,"['Niemitz, Carsten']",Zeitschrift fur Morphologie und Anthropologie,NA,2002-Mar,5,"Early ontogenetic stages are often assumed to reflect or to be similar to past phylogenetic stages within the evolution of man. Therefore, as a first step, the quadrupedal crawling locomotion of human children was analysed and compared to the quadrupedal walk of Macaca fascicularis. The movements of the human child were not only more irregular, they differed from the walk of the monkey mainly through extraordinarily short swing phases, and also through strong scoliotic movements of the spine. There is a compulsory synchronisation in the hip and knee joint movements of the human crawling baby. We conclude that human crawling may be a behavioural recapitulation of a quadrupedal evolutionary stage. However, with reference to kinematics, man is not only characterised by his unique, habitually bipedal, upright gait but also by a second, equally unique locomotion, namely crawling, which he assumes for a short phase during his first year of life.--The walking movements of the limbs in toddling infants were mainly characterised by i) rather stiff, abducted arms, which were moved mostly by spine torsions (similar to those of bipedally walking Gorilla) and not as a suspensory pendulum. However, they rather work as levers for the elastic torsion pendulum of the spine. ii) They are also characterised by frequently lacking the minor knee flexion, which occurs at about the heel strike within each stride of the adult human. Besides many other details of the results, foot movements differed from adult ones mainly in that the whole plantar surface was placed flat on the ground within a few milliseconds."

Compared to other divisions of the CYP2 gene family, the CYP2F subfamily is unusual in having few genes per species and in being selectively expressed in lung tissues. Sequencing genomic DNAs from human and gorilla has allowed us to determine the number of CYP2F subfamily loci in these species, the sources of known human transcripts, and the functional status of CYP2F loci in both primates. This information will make accurate genotyping of the functional and medically significant CYP2F1 gene possible in humans. Comparisons across multiple species show that the sequences of CYP2F subfamily genes are very conserved in mammals for intronic as well as exonic DNA. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The African apes differ in the degree to which they consume leaves and other fibrous vegetation. Gorilla gorilla beringei, the eastern mountain gorilla, consumes the most restricted diet comprised of mechanically resistant foods such as leaves, pith, bark, and bamboo. Gorilla gorilla gorilla, the western lowland gorilla subspecies, consumes leaves and other terrestrial herbaceous vegetation (THV) but also consumes a fair amount of ripe, fleshy fruit. In contrast to gorillas, chimpanzees are frugivores and rely on vegetation primarily as fallback foods. However, there has been a long-standing debate regarding whether Pan paniscus, the pygmy chimpanzee (or bonobo), consumes greater quantities of THV as compared to Pan troglodytes, the common chimpanzee. Because consumption of resistant foods involves more daily chewing cycles and may require larger average bite force, the mechanical demands placed on the masticatory system are expected to be greater in folivores as compared to primates that consume large quantities of fleshy fruit. Therefore, more folivorous taxa are predicted to exhibit features that improve load-resistance capabilities and increase force production.

To test this hypothesis, jaw and skull dimensions were compared in ontogenetic series of G. g. beringei, G. g. gorilla, P. t. troglodytes, and P. paniscus. Controlling the influence of allometry, results show that compared to both chimpanzees and bonobos, gorillas exhibit some features of the jaw complex that are suggestive of improved masticatory efficiency. For example, compared to all other taxa, G. g. beringei has a significantly wider mandibular corpus and symphysis, larger area for the masseter muscle, higher mandibular ramus, and higher mandibular condyle relative to the occlusal plane of the mandible. However, the significantly wider mandibular symphysis may be an architectural response to increasing symphyseal curvature with interspecific increase in size. Moreover, Gorilla and Pan do not vary consistently in all features, and some differences run counter to predictions based on dietary variation. Thus, the morphological responses are not entirely consonant with predictions based on hypothesized loading regimes. Finally, despite morphological differences between bonobos and chimpanzees, there is no systematic pattern of differentiation that can be clearly linked to differences in diet. Results indicate that while some features may be linked to differences in diet among the African apes, diet alone cannot account for the patterns of morphological variation demonstrated in this study. Allometric constraints and dental development also appear to play a role in morphological differentiation among the African apes. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

"Urinary androgen and corticoid levels in captive, male western lowland gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla): Age- and social group-related differences","['Stoinski, TS', 'Czekala, N', 'Lukas, KE', 'Maple, TL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.1065,FEB 2002,26,"Urinary androgen and corticoid levels were measured for 52 captive male Western lowland gorillas to examine age-related variance and potential differences resulting from various social situations. Significant diurnal variation was present in both hormones. Age-related differences in androgens revealed that males experienced two stages of androgen increase and one stage of decrease: increases occurred from juvenile (less than 10 yr of age) to subadult (between 10-13 yr) and subadult to young adult (14-20 yr), whereas decreases occurred from young adult to adult (> 20 yr). Age-related differences in corticoid levels varied depending on the time of day, but morning corticoids were greatest in juvenile males, followed by young adult males. The type of social grouping was associated with differences in corticoid levels, as animals housed socially (in either a heterosexual or all-male group) had similar corticoid levels, whereas solitary males showed greater corticoid levels than their socially-housed counterparts. The increased levels of corticoids in solitary-housed males suggest this management strategy might not be optimal, although more data are needed. Additionally, the significantly greater levels of androgens and corticoids in young adult male gorillas may present management challenges, and thus zoos may need to consider increasing the flexibility of their current management practices with respect to males.

Reconciliation in captive chimpanzees: A reevaluation with controlled methods,"['Preuschoft, S', 'Wang, X', 'Aureli, F', 'de Waal, FBM']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1013293623158,FEB 2002,47,"Affiliative postconflict reunions-reconciliations-of former opponents were first demonstrated in the chimpanzees at the Arnhem Zoo. Since then methods have been considerably refined, and reconciliation has been demonstrated in a large number of primates and also some gregarious nonprimates. This study, conducted with a different captive group, is the first to use the revised methodology with chimpanzees. We analyzed a total of 297 agonistic conflicts with the PC-MC method: we observed focal individuals for 15 min after a conflict and during matched control observations the next day. The mean conciliatory tendency of the 16 chimpanzees was 41%, with a range in different age-sex classes of 58% (among adult females) to 19% (among adult vs. immature males). After conflicts, former opponents were selectively attracted to one another. Preferential contact with previous opponents persisted when activity level during matched controls was controlled for statistically. Opponents chat were frequent grooming partners reconciled more frequently, but the frequency of agonistic support had no such effect. Our findings thus confirm the existence of reconciliation in chimpanzees, which show one of the highest conciliatory tendencies among primate species."
"Scabies in free-ranging mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda","['Kalema-Zikusoka, G', 'Kock, RA', 'Macfie, EJ']",VETERINARY RECORD,NA,JAN 5 2002,30,"Between August and December 1996, there was an outbreak of a debilitating skin disease attributed to Sarcoptes scabiei infection in mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda. All four members of a gorilla group which had been habituated to tourists were clinically affected; the infant male gorilla was most severely affected and died, the juvenile male showed serious manifestations of the disease and the two adult animals showed milder signs. The three older animals recovered after a single intramuscular dose of ivermectin. S scabiei mites were observed on skin scrapings and biopsies taken while the juvenile was immobilised and in postmortem samples taken from the infant. The clinical signs did not recur during the following year, and no other gorilla groups in the park were observed to be clinically affected."
Human-specific duplication and mosaic transcripts: The recent paralogous structure of chromosome 22,"['Bailey, JA', 'Yavor, AM', 'Viggiano, L', 'Misceo, D', 'Horvath, JE', 'Archidiacono, N', 'Schwartz, S', 'Rocchi, M', 'Eichler, EE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS,10.1086/338458,JAN 2002,121,"In recent decades, comparative chromosomal banding, chromosome painting, and gene-order studies have shown strong conservation of gross chromosome structure and gene order in mammals. However, findings from the human genome sequence suggest an unprecedented degree of recent (<35 million years ago) segmental duplication. This dynamism of segmental duplications has important implications in disease and evolution. Here we present a chromosome-wide view of the structure and evolution of the most highly homologous duplications (<greater than or equal to>1 kb and greater than or equal to 90%) on chromosome 22. Overall, 10.8% (3.7/33.8 Mb) of chromosome 22 is duplicated, with an average sequence identity of 95.4%. To organize the duplications into tractable units, intron-exon structure and well-defined duplication boundaries were used to define 78 duplicated modules (minimally shared evolutionary segments) with 157 copies on chromosome 22. Analysis of these modules provides evidence for the creation or modification of 11 novel transcripts. Comparative FISH analyses of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and macaque reveal qualitative and quantitative differences in the distribution of these duplications-consistent with their recent origin. Several duplications appear to be human specific, including a similar to 400-kb duplication (99.4%-99.8% sequence identity) that transposed from chromosome 14 to the most proximal pericentromeric region of chromosome 22. Experimental and in silico data further support a pericentromeric gradient of duplications where the most recent duplications transpose adjacent to the centromere. Taken together, these data suggest that segmental duplications have been an ongoing process of primate genome evolution, contributing to recent gene innovation and the dynamic transformation of genome architecture within and among closely related species."

Estimation of large mammal densities in the Ipassa-Makokou reserve (Gabon),"['Okouyi, JO', 'Posso, P', 'Lepretre, A', 'Scaps, P']",BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE ZOOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE,NA,2002,2,"The UNESCO reserve Man and Biosphere (MAB) of Ipassa-Makou, located in north-east Gabon (Central Africa), was well studied by the scientists of the CNRS (Centre national de la recherche scientifique) from 1963 to 1985 (more than 400 publications, collections, an herbarium, a scientific journal Biologica gabonica and infrastructures which could receive scientists in the forest). In consequence, the vertebrate fauna of the reserve is particularly well known: 128 mammal species, 424 bird species, 65 reptile species and 47 amphibian species. Unfortunately, the reserve was abandoned by the CNRS in 1985 and by scientists in general. Since that time, the reserve has been submitted to high human pressures (poaching, agriculture). The main goal of this study is to survey the present reserve faunistic resources. In order to estimate the densities of some species of macro-mammals still present in the reserve, we conducted line-transect censures. We censured elephants, monkeys and duikers because they are the main preoccupation of researchers and wildlife managers in African rain forests. We conducted censures during two periods between 2000 (May-September) and 2001 (April-June). Eight censures were carried out on each side of the Niabare River in order to cover the reserve (100 km(2)). Each census route covered 5 km and we walked each census five times. We used identical methods during censures. Observers conducted all censures between 07:30 and 12:30 h. During each census, we walked slowly, travelling approximately 1 km per h, and pausing at regular intervals to scan the forest. Data were obtained from direct (individuals or group of individuals sighted) and indirect (chimpanzee and gorilla nests, elephant dung piles) observations.

Results indicate that, in spite of high human pressure, all the large taxe are still present in the reserve. The densities observed are generally similar to those found in African rain forests. Nevertheless, some local variations were detected. The most abundant cercopithecines species present in the reserve are greater white-nosed monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans) (56,43 ind/km(2)), moustached monkeys (Cercopithecus cephus) (19.08 ind/km(2)) and mona monkeys (Cercopithecus pogonias) (7.07 ind/km(2)). If greater white-nosed monkeys are the most abundant diurnal primates present in the reserve, it is not the case in the north-east Gabon forests where mona monkeys are more numerous. On the contrary to the cercopithecines, duikers densities are relatively low. The estimated density of blue duikers (Cephalophus monticola) is 8.04 ind/km(2). Nevertheless, in the eighties, densities were estimated to be over than 50 ind/km(2). This result indicates that blue duikers may have experienced significant reduction over the past 20 years at Ipassa-Makokou. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are still present in the reserve while they have disappreared upstream of the Ivindo great river. Estimate of lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) density is 0.75 ind/km(2) and is greater than that previously censured in the region (0.44 ind/km(2)). This difference may be explained by the fact that a group of individuals would have crossed the reserve during the census period. Estimates of elephant (Loxodonta africana) abundance from indirect (dung piles) and direct observations are respectively 0.58 ind/km(2) and 1.10 ind/km(2). These densities are in the range of those censured in West Africa (Ghana, Ivory Coast and Central African Republic)

All these results confer a particular interest on this reserve which is located near the town of Makokou and which can serve as a model for conservation purposes in the region."
Direct evidence for the Homo-Pan clade,"['Wimmer, R', 'Kirsch, S', 'Rappold, GA', 'Schempp, W']",CHROMOSOME RESEARCH,10.1023/A:1014222311431,2002,15,"For a long time, the evolutionary relationship between human and African apes, the 'trichotomy problem. has been debated with strong differences in opinion and interpretation. Statistical analyses of different molecular DNA data sets have been carried out and have primarily supported a Homo-Pall clade. An alternative way to address this question is by the comparison of evolutionarily relevant chromosomal breakpoints. Here., we made use of a P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) /bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig spanning approximately 2.8 Mb on the long arm of the human Y chromosome, to comparatively map individual PAC clones to chromosomes from great apes, gibbons, and two species of Old World monkeys by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. During our search for evolutionary breakpoints on the Y chromosome, it transpired that a transposition of an approximately 100-kb DNA fragment from chromosome 1 onto the Y chromosome must have occurred in a common ancestor of human, chimpanzee and bonobo. Only the Y chromosomes of these three species contain the chromosome-1-derived fragment; it could not be detected on the Y chromosomes of gorillas or the other primates examined. Thus, this shared derived (synapomorphic) trait provides clear evidence for a Homo-Pan clade independent of DNA sequence analysis."
GPS and GIS methods in an African rain forest: Applications to tropical ecology and conservation,"['Dominy, NJ', 'Duncan, B']",CONSERVATION ECOLOGY,NA,JAN 2002,4,"Since the completion of the Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) in 1995, the integration of GPS and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology has expanded to a great number of ecological and conservation applications. In tropical rain forest ecology, however, the technology has remained relatively neglected, despite its great potential. Notwithstanding cost, this is principally due to (1) the difficulty of quality satellite reception beneath a dense forest canopy, and (2) a degree of spatial error unacceptable to fine-scale vegetation mapping. Here, we report on the technical use of GPS/GIS in the rain forest of Kibale National Park, Uganda, and the methodology necessary to acquire high-accuracy spatial measurements. We conclude that the stringent operating parameters necessary for high accuracy were rarely obtained while standing beneath the rain forest canopy. Raising the GPS antenna to heights of 25-30 m resolved this problem, allowing swift data collection on the spatial dispersion of individual rain forest trees. We discuss the impact of the 1996 Presidential Decision Directive that suspended U.S. military-induced GPS error on 1 May 2000, and comment on the potential applications of GPS/GIS technology to the ecological study and conservation of tropical rain forests."

Comparative FISH-mapping of DNA clones specific for CDY and DAZ resulted in a Y-specific but diverse signal pattern within the non-recombining region of the Y-chromosomes of human and great apes. It can be concluded that the non-recombining part of the Y-chromosomes including CDY and DAZ, was exposed to species-specific amplifications, diversifications and rearrangements. Evolutionary fast fixation of any of these variations was possible as long as they did not interfere with male fertility. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel."
Human chromosome 15q11-q14 regions of rearrangements contain clusters of LCR15 duplicons,"['Pujana, MA', 'Nadal, M', 'Guitart, M', 'Armengol, L', 'Gratacos, M', 'Estivill, X']",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS,10.1038/sj/ejhg/5200760,JAN 2002,59,"Six breakpoint regions for rearrangements of human chromosome 15q11-q14 have been described. These rearrangements involve deletions found in approximately 70% of Prader-Willi or Angelman's syndrome patients (PWS, AS), duplications detected in some cases of autism, triplications and inverted duplications. HERC2-containing (HEct domain and RCc1 domain protein 2) segmental duplications or duplicons are present at two of these breakpoints (13132 and BP3) mainly associated with deletions. We show here that clusters containing several copies of the human chromosome 15 low-copy repeat (LCR15) duplicon are located at each of the six described 15q11-q14 BPS. In addition, our results suggest the existence of breakpoints for large 15q11-q13 deletions in a proximal duplicon-containing clone. The study reveals that HERC2-containing duplicons (estimated on 50-400 kb) and LCR15 duplicons (similar to 15 kb on 15q11-q14) share the golgin-like protein (GLP) genomic sequence. Through the analysis of a human BAC library and public databases we have identified 36 LCR15 related sequences in the human genome, most (27) mapping to chromosome 15q and being transcribed. LCR15 analysis in non-human primates and age-sequence divergences support a recent origin of this family of segmental duplications through human speciation."

Correlates of infant-directed behavior in captive gorillas: A brief review,"['Bahr, NI']",EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/evan.10092,2002,0,"In the early 1970s, preadult experience of other females' infants in the natal social group was considered essential for the demonstration of species-specific maternal behavior by a gorilla female toward her own infant. This assumption was based on the fact that the wild-caught founder stock and early generations of captive-born gorillas which showed various degrees of maternal incompetence were typically raised by human surrogate caregivers in a social environment lacking mother-infant dyads and the opportunity for gaining maternal experience. However, evidence which has accumulated since then strongly supports the hypothesis that the expression of species-specific maternal behavior in gorillas is governed by multiple factors, preadult maternal experience being only one important factor."

Mutations in the factor IX gene (F9) during the past 150 years have relative rates similar to ancient mutations,"['Feng, JN', 'Drost, JB', 'Scaringe, WA', 'Liu, Q', 'Sommer, SS']",HUMAN MUTATION,10.1002/humu.10018,2002,4,"Pollutants and dietary mutagens have been associated with somatic mutation and cancer, but the extent of their influence on germline mutation is not clear. Since deleterious germline mutations can be transmitted for thousands of years, any influence on germline mutation from the vast increase in man-made chemicals of the past 150 years would be an important public health issue. Observed disease causing mutations in the X-linked factor IX gene (F9) of hemophilia B patients originated predominantly in the past 150 years, since the half-life of these mutations in human populations had been about two generations before effective treatment became available about a generation ago. Recent changes in germline mutational processes may be detected by comparison of the observed hemophilia B causing mutation pattern in F9 with the pattern of neutral polymorphisms which occurred over a much longer period of time. By scanning a total of 1.5 megabases of deep intronic regions of F9 in the genomic DNA from 84 individuals, 42 neutral polymorphisms were found in 23 haplotypes that differed by at least 11 mutations from the ancestral primate haplotype. By sequencing F9 in seven non,human primates, 39 of these polymorphisms were characterized as ancient mutations relative to a unanimous ancestral primate allele. This ancient mutation pattern was compared to the recent pattern of hemophilia B causing mutations. Remarkably, no significant difference was found (P=0.5), suggesting that the vast increase in man-made chemicals during the past 150 years has not had a major impact on the pattern of human germline mutation. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that endogenous processes dominate germline mutation. Hum Mutat 19:49-57, 2002. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Soft-tissue anatomy of the extant hominoids: a review and phylogenetic analysis,"['Gibbs, S', 'Collard, M', 'Wood, B']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1046/j.0021-8782.2001.00001.x,JAN 2002,49,"This paper reports the results of a literature search for information about the soft-tissue anatomy of the extant non-human hominoid genera, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo and Hylobates, together with the results of a phylogenetic analysis of these data plus comparable data for Homo. information on the four extant non-human hominoid genera was located for 240 out of the 1783 soft-tissue structures listed in the Nomina Anatomica. Numerically these data are biased so that information about some systems (e.g. muscles) and some regions (e.g. the forelimb) are over-represented, whereas other systems and regions (e.g. the veins and the lymphatics of the vascular system, the head region) are either under-represented or not represented at all. Screening to ensure that the data were suitable for use in a phylogenetic analysis reduced the number of eligible soft-tissue structures to 171. These data, together with comparable data for modern humans, were converted into discontinuous character states suitable for phylogenetic analysis and then used to construct a taxon-by-character matrix. This matrix was used in two tests of the hypothesis that soft-tissue characters can be relied upon to reconstruct hominoid phylogenetic relationships. In the first, parsimony analysis was used to identify cladograms requiring the smallest number of character state changes. In the second, the phylogenetic bootstrap was used to determine the confidence intervals of the most parsimonious clades. The parsimony analysis yielded a single most parsimonious cladogram that matched the molecular cladogram. Similarly the bootstrap analysis yielded clades that were compatible with the molecular cladogram; a (Homo, Pan) clade was supported by 95% of the replicates, and a (Gorilla, Pan, Homo) clade by 96%. These are the first hominoid morphological data to provide statistically significant support for the clades favoured by the molecular evidence."

Conservation of the class I beta-tubulin gene in human populations and lack of mutations in lung cancers and paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancers,"['Sale, S', 'Sung, R', 'Shen, PD', 'Yu, K', 'Wang, Y', 'Duran, GE', 'Kim, JH', 'Fojo, T', 'Oefner, PJ', 'Sikic, BI']",MOLECULAR CANCER THERAPEUTICS,NA,JAN 2002,69,"The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of sequence variants in the class I beta-tubulin (clone m40) gene and their occurrence in human tumors and cancer cell lines. DNA was isolated from 93 control individuals representing a wide variety of ethnicities, 49 paclitaxel-naive specimens (16 ovarian cancers, 17 non-small cell lung cancers, and 16 ovarian cancer cell lines), and 30 paclitaxel-resistant specimens (9 ovarian cancers, 9 ovarian cancer cell lines, and 12 ovarian cancer xenografts in nude mice). Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequence analysis detected two silent polymorphisms in exon 4, Leu217Leu (CTG/CTA) and Gly400Gly (GGC/ GGT), with minor allele frequencies of 17 and 0.5%, respectively. Five nucleotide substitutions and one single-base deletion were detected in introns 1, 2, and 3 and in the 3' untranslated region. Analysis of 49 paclitaxel-naive and 30 paclitaxel-resistant specimens revealed no additional polymorphisms in the coding region. In addition, no amino acid replacements were found in chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan in comparison to human. Our data demonstrate a very high degree of sequence conservation in class I beta-tubulin, suggesting that all residues are important in tubulin structure and function. Individual variation in response to treatment with paclitaxel is not likely to be caused by genetic variations in the beta-tubulin drug target. Moreover, acquired mutations in class I beta-tubulin are unlikely to be a clinically relevant cause of drug resistance."

Ascarid nematodes in domestic and wild terrestrial mammals.,"['Okulewicz, A', 'Lonc, E', 'Borgsteede, F H M']",Polish journal of veterinary sciences,NA,2002,7,"The biology of the ascarid nematodes has been discussed in the context of their important economic role in farm animals, pet animals and zoo animals with special attention to carnivores and primates. In farm animals, infection with the most common roundworm of horses (Parascaris equorum) and swine (Ascaris suum) depend on many factors such as environmental conditions (larval development in the egg and egg survival), age of the host, breed, husbandry system, hygiene and treatment schedule. The monoxenic ascarids Toxocara canis and T. cati are the most important nematodes in carnivorous animals (dogs, cats, foxes) and carnivores in the zoo. In the period of March 2000 till March 2001, 57.1% of examined representatives of Felidae, Ursidae and Canidae in the Zoological Garden of Wroclaw were found to be infected with ascarids (T. canis, T. cati, Toxascaris leonina). The prevalence of T. canis in the Canidae was 66.7%, of T. cati in the Felidae was 14.3%, while 57.1% of the Felidae carried T. leonina infection. Ascaris lumbricoides, a typical parasite of primates, was found in some gorillas, chimpanzees and orang-utans during parasitological survey."
Effects of hand-rearing on the reproductive success of western lowland gorillas in North America,"['Ryan, S', 'Thompson, SD', 'Roth, AM', 'Gold, KC']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.10045,2002,14,"This study sought to assess the potential effects of hand-rearing by evaluating the relationships among rearing type and reproductive success in the American Zoo and Aquarium Association's Species Survival Plan(R) for western lowland gorillas.

We found no significant differences in the number of reproductive zoo-born (ZB) and WB females, but more WB males sired infants than their ZB counterparts. This was influenced by a skew in the number of reproductive years for WB males in the studbook. ZB males showed no difference in infants produced per reproductive year, as compared to WB males, while ZB females produced more infants per reproductive year than did WB females. Mother-reared (MR), ZB females produced more offspring and used more reproductive opportunity than hand-reared (HR) females, whereas rearing had no effect on the reproductive success of ZB males. Moreover, MR and partially hand-reared (PHR) females were more likely to become nurturing mothers themselves. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Change of enclosure in langur monkeys: Implications for the evaluation of environmental enrichment,"['Little, KA', 'Sommer, V']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.10058,2002,19,"A group of Hanuman langurs (Presbytis entellus) was studied before and after it was moved from an old cage-style enclosure to a novel naturalistic environment at the London Zoo. Eating and locomotion occupied more of the langurs' time in their new enclosure, whereas dozing, allogrooming, and aggression decreased, along with an increase in inter-individual distances. These changes are attributed to the larger area, the stimulating new environment, and the langurs' increased distance from visitors. Nevertheless, the study raises questions about how to define standards of desirable environmental enrichment, as the activity patterns recorded in both the old and new enclosures are within the variation observed in the wild."
Tripedal knuckle-walking: A proposal for the evolution of human locomotion and handedness,"['Kelly, RE', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,10.1006/jtbi.2001.2421,DEC 7 2001,11,"A comparative morphological analysis of human and non-human hominoids was conducted in an attempt to determine the mode of locomotion of the protohominid. Although the generalized hominoid anatomy permits variation of locomotion: brachiation, knuckle-walking, etc., minor variations in structure determine which behavior is favored. Arboreal arm swinging requires a flexible forelimb while terrestrial fist or knuckle-walking demands more rigidity of the hand and wrist. It is demonstrated that the large human thumb accompanied by the strong adduction of the thenar, hypothenar, and palmar interosseous muscles offer powerful rigidity to the hand, while fusion of the os centrale with the scaphoid during gestation permits the formation of an arch of carpals which imbue the wrist with the stability necessary for weight bearing. Fascialization of the contrahentes and dorsiepitrochlearis muscles in the human as well as depilation of the middle phalanges; the webbing (syndactyly) of the palm; the direction of the fibers of the interosseous membrane of the forearm; the shape of the puerile annular ligament, and the direction of the human glenoid fossa strongly suggest that the ancestor of man used a knuckle-walking form of locomotion prior to becoming bipedal. A model is presented that suggests that bipedalism was attained through an intermediate stage of tripedalism. The model is based on the fact that man's anatomy is much more asymmetric than that of the great apes. A presumption is made that due to the absence of trees for climbing in the transition from forest to open plain, the protohominid needed to carry tools (stones) at all times for protection. Stones could be carried for long distances on the posterior iliac crest since the weight would be shifted posteriorly over the legs. Pick up, medial rotation and adduction of the stone would employ a two-muscle chain of biceps brachii and latissimus dorsi. On the iliac crest, the stone is posterior to the coronal plane of the glenohumeral joint, and with the contraction of this two-muscle chain, the shoulder on one side is moved posteriorly effecting a semi-erect posture. It is proposed that tripedalism of the protohominid may be an explanation for the handedness unique to hominids. (C) 2001 Academic Press."
Primate molar crown formation times and life history evolution revisited,"['Macho, GA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.1054,DEC 2001,41,"Comparative studies have convincingly demonstrated that the pattern and timing of tooth emergence are highly correlated with life-history variables and brain size. Conversely, a firm relationship between molar formation time and life-history variables has not yet been established. It seems counterintuitive that one aspect of dental development should be correlated with life-history variables, whereas the other should not. In order to shed light on this apparent discrepancy this study analyzed all data on primate molar crown formations available in the published literature in relation to life-history variables, brain size, and female body mass. Crown formation times were found to be particularly highly correlated with both female body mass and brain size. Species that depart from the overall brain/body allometry by being relatively large-bodied, e.g., Gorilla gorilla and later Theropithecus oswaldi, also have shorter molar crown formation times than expected. The reverse is not found for species that depart from the overall brain/body allometry due to their larger brains, i.e., Homo sapiens. This finding is interpreted within an evolutionary and ecological framework. Specifically, by focusing on ecological commonalities, a scenario is proposed which may allow predictions to be made about the evolutionary history of other extinct primates also. If confirmed in future studies, crown formation time may again become a powerful tool in evolutionary enquiry. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Changes of urinary steroid conjugates and gonadotropin excretion in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy in the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti),"['He, YM', 'Pei, YJ', 'Zou, RJ', 'Ji, WZ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.1056,DEC 2001,13,"The Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) is one of the most endangered species in the world, and it is endemic to China. According to our knowledge, there was no information on reproduction for this species. The present study was designed to understand the characteristics of reproductive hormone secretion during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy of this species by monitoring urinary estrone conjugate (E1C), pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PdG), bioactive follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). The urine samples were collected each day from four adult females for eight menstrual cycles, and once in 3 days during pregnancy (three full-term pregnancies, one mid-term abortion). The steroid conjugate was tested by radioimmunoassays (RIAs), and bioactive FSH and LH levels were measured in vitro by the sensitive bioassays granulosa cell aromatize bioassay (GAB) and rat interstitial cell testosterone (RICT), respectively. The results showed that: 1) E1C presented a preovulatory peak (183.9 +/- 8.6 ng/mgCr) followed by a definite elevation of PdG; 2) PdG in the luteal phase (754.4 +/- 30.6 ng/mgCr) was three- to fivefold higher than during the corresponding follicular phase (198.3 +/- 11.4 ng/mgCr); 3) the peaks of bio-LH and bio-FSH were on the same day, while the E1C peak was 1 or 2 days before the peaks for these two hormones; 4) bio-FSH levels were higher in the follicular phase than in the luteal phase, and bio-LH levels elevated slightly in the luteal phase; 5) the mean cycle length was 23.6 +/- 3.5 days (n = 3) based upon successive urinary LH peaks; 6) based on the interval from the day of E1C peak to the day of parturition, the gestation was 203.7 +/- 2.5 days (n = 3); and 7) both E1C and PdG increased and remained high after pregnancy, with a sharp decrease in basal levels following parturition or mid-term abortion. The results suggested that the pattern of reproductive hormones for R. bieti is similar to that of other Old World monkeys, but the concentration of the hormones is different from that of other species. This species has a longer progestation period, which may be related to its classification status. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
A gorilla with 'Grandpa's eyes': How children interpret visual texts - A case study of Anthony Browne's 'Zoo',"['Styles, M', 'Arizpe, E']",CHILDRENS LITERATURE IN EDUCATION,10.1023/A:1012760422501,DEC 2001,5,"This article explores the multilayered nature of a single picture book by Anthony Browne and the sophisticated responses (including their own pictures) children aged 4-11 bring to interpreting such a text. Emphasis is laid on the high-level cognitive skills involved in reading visual images and links are made between seeing and thinking. Some features of the children's understanding are examined in detail; for example, how they interpret visual imagery and deal with a variety of challenging artistic features, and how their drawings show knowledge and feelings they are not yet able to articulate. The findings also suggest that some children who are not yet confident at reading print have developed impressive capacities for analysing image."

In this study we investigated whether prepartum titers of urinary estrone conjugates (E1C) or pregnanediol-3 alpha -glucuronide (PdG) were related to postpartum maternal behavior in eight multiparous Western lowland gorilla females (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) housed in four zoological gardens. Urine samples were collected from each study animal for 14 days prepartum and 14 days postpartum, and measures of maternal responsiveness were scored during the first 15 days postpartum. Urine samples were assayed with radioimmunoassay for E1C and PdG. Results for the peripartum profiles of urinary E1C, as well as postpartum profiles of PdG, agree with previous findings for the gorilla, while results for late-pregnancy profiles of urinary PdG were inconclusive in confirming a prepartum increase or decrease. Neither prepartum levels of E1C or PdG, nor the E1C/PdG ratio were found to be related to measures of postpartum maternal behavior. This lack of association between late-pregnancy E1C titers per se and postpartum maternal behavior is contrary to findings in nonprimate and other primate species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science."
The human SDF1 gene polymorphism is located on a mutational hot spot that was identified by the hominoid genome study,"['Kimura, R', 'Ishida, T']",HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1353/hub.2001.0084,DEC 2001,1,"Nucleotide sequences of a part of the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) gene 3' untranslated region were studied among hominoids (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and gibbons). An identical sequence to the human SDF1-3'G allele was found in chimpanzees and gibbons, whereas that to the 3'A allele was found in gorillas. Based on the sequence data and the hominoid phylogenctic relation, it was suggested that an adenine nucleotide at nucleotide position (np) 801 in humans and gorillas was independently introduced into each lineage after the specific divergence and an ancestral hominoid sequence of this site (np 799-802) was deduced as CCGG. The present data showing a mutational hot spot on this site suggest the possible presence of multiple origins of the worldwide distribution of the SDF1-3'A allele in humans."

We used a marked-nest census method to examine seasonal changes in chimpanzees' use of the different vegetation types. We made 10 parallel line-transects in the study, area; they were 5-km long and 500-m apart. During the first 3-4 walks along the transects, we marked all existing nests. We then conducted 10 main censuses of all transects at 15-day, intervals, over a total period of about 5 months. In each main census, we recorded all unmarked nests visible from the transects and marked them. When we saw a nest, we searched for neighboring nests of the same age class less than or equal to 30 m of each other, in order to estimate the size and position of nest groups. To improve the accuracy, of the estimation of nest density, in each census period, we excluded nests that consisted only of brown leaves and corrected the number of nests observed by allowing for the proportion of newly-built nests that would still have green leaves at the next main census. We estimated the population density of chimpanzees in the study area both by the number of individual nests and by, the number of nest groups; the two methods gave similar results. We found differences in number of chimpanzees that used different vegetation types in different fruiting seasons, and differences ire nest group, size related to the different fruiting seasons."
Hand preference for food processing in wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Parnell, RJ']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037//0735-7036.115.4.365,DEC 2001,19,"Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) have not previously been represented in studies of laterality in wild great apes. The discovery of swampy clearings frequented by gorillas in northern Congo has provided the first opportunity to redress this imbalance. Hand preference data are presented from 33 gorillas in seated and standing postures, covering the procurement and processing of 2 to 4 plant species. Levels of hand preference exhibited were low. When data from all postures and plant species were pooled, 33% of gorillas showed hand preferences in excess of chance. In the standing posture, more gorillas exhibited significant left-hand preferences than right, but an overall population-level bias was not evident."
Rectal prolapse in a free-ranging mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei): Clinical presentation and surgical management,"['Kalema-Zikusoka, G', 'Lowenstine, L']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,DEC 2001,5,"A juvenile female mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) of the Mubare tourist group in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, developed a severe, complete rectal prolapse that did not spontaneously resolve. Eight months prior, a juvenile female mountain gorilla of the Mubare group developed a mild, complete rectal prolapse that resolved spontaneously within 24 hr. Field guides reported that spontaneously resolving prolapses had been seen previously in two other juveniles, one of which was from the Mubare group. The tissue became increasingly necrotic and maggot infested over the course of 1 wk. Surgical intervention involved amputation of the affected rectal tissues and suturing the viable portion to the anal sphincter muscle with simple interrupted absorbable sutures. The surgery was performed in the field in accordance with Uganda Wildlife Authority policies. Antibiotics and anthelmintics were administered systemically, and the gorilla returned to the group. The gorilla appeared to recover fully after 3 wk. Histology of the resected rectal tissue confirmed intense inflammation and necrosis with myiasis but did not reveal an underlying etiology."
Hyperkeratotic mange caused by Sarcoptes scabiei (Acariformes : Sarcoptidae) in juvenile human-habituated mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei),"['Graczyk, TK', 'Mudakikwa, AB', 'Cranfield, MR', 'Eilenberger, U']",PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH,NA,DEC 2001,25,"To facilitate ecotourism and behavioral research, free-ranging mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) have been habituated to humans. During routine health monitoring, five juvenile gorillas were observed with active crusted dermatitis and alopecia. Papular and vesicular lesions and crusts with papular eruption and oozing were numerous and disseminated over the body of one gorilla with a confirmed infestation of scabies. In this gorilla, the hyperkeratotic crusts were loose and thick with a flaky and scaly appearance. Histologically, the epidermis was thickened, displayed hyperkeratosis and was infiltrated with lymphocytes and neutrophils. Examination of skin scraping yielded a positive identification of adults and eggs of Sarcoptes scabiei mites. The gorillas were treated with ivermectin, 200 mg(.)kg(-1). As S. scabiei mites can cross-infect various mammalian species causing self-limiting dermatitis, these ectoparasites can be propagated in the habitats shared by gorillas, people, and livestock, and therefore they represent an anthropozoonotic threat."
Temperamental contributions to the affect family of anxiety,"['Kagan, J', 'Snidman, N', 'McManis, M', 'Woodward, S']",PSYCHIATRIC CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA,10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70257-4,DEC 2001,17,"A large proportion of scientists and clinicians write about anxiety as if this concept referred to a unitary natural phenomenon, and the intellectual challenge was to achieve consensus on the correct definition and discover the most valid measurements of this process. The continued reliance by investigators on familiar words like anxiety presumes that the human communities that invented this contextually unconstrained term eons ago possessed a profound insight into the nature of human emotions. The popular words for emotions were intended to communicate to another that an agent experienced consciously a change in body tone that could not be attributed to an organic need. Further, the community of listeners understood that the agent was accommodating to the incentive and accompanying thoughts when a word was selected to describe the feeling state. The evidence used to infer the emotional state of anxiety in humans can include verbal report, observed behavior, and physiology. These classes of information are not correlated highly. Therefore, the meaning of anxiety inferred from one source is not equivalent to the meaning inferred from another. That is, a verbal report of anxiety over one's economic position need not be correlated with the biological profile scientists presume is the basis for that emotion. A serious problem with the current construct of anxiety is that investigators are prone to award the same term to four distinctly different phenomena."

Enamel hypoplasia in the deciduous teeth of great apes: Variation in prevalence and timing of defects,"['Lukacs, JR']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.1115,NOV 2001,11,"The prevalence of enamel hypoplasia in the deciduous teeth of great apes has the potential to reveal episodes of physiological stress in early stages of ontogenetic development. However, little is known about enamel defects of deciduous teeth in great apes. Unresolved questions addressed in this study are: Do hypoplastic enamel defects occur with equal frequency in different groups of great apes? Are enamel hypoplasias more prevalent in the deciduous teeth of male or female apes? During what phase of dental development do enamel defects tend to form? And, what part of the dental crown is most commonly affected?

To answer these questions, infant and juvenile skulls of two sympatric genera of great apes (Gorilla and Pan) were examined for dental enamel hypoplasias. Specimens from the Powell-Cotton Museum (Quex Park, UK; n = 107) are reported here, and compared with prior findings based on my examination of juvenile apes at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History (Hamman-Todd Collection; n = 100) and Smithsonian Institution (National Museum of Natural History; n = 36). All deciduous teeth were examined by the author with a X 10 hand lens, in oblique incandescent light. Defects were classified using Federation Dentaire International (FDI)/Defects of Dental Enamel (DDE) standards; defect size and location on the tooth crown were measured and marked on dental outline charts. Enamel defects of ape deciduous teeth are most common on the labial surface of canine teeth. While deciduous incisor and molar teeth consistently exhibit similar defects with prevalences of similar to 10%, canines average between 70-75%. Position of enamel defects on the canine crown was analyzed by dividing it into three zones (apical, middle, and cervical) and calculating defect prevalence by zone. Among gorillas, enamel hypoplasia prevalence increases progressively from the apical zone (low) to the middle zone to the cervical zone (highest), in both maxillary and mandibular canine teeth.

Results from all three study collections reveal that among the great apes, gorillas (87-92%) and orangutans (91%) have a significantly higher prevalence of canine enamel defects than chimpanzees (22-48%). Sex differences in canine enamel hypoplasia are small and not statistically significant in any great ape. Factors influencing intergroup variation in prevalence of enamel defects and their distribution on the canine crown, including physiological stress and interspecific dento-gnathic morphological variation, are evaluated.

Do gorilla females join males to avoid infanticide? A quantitative model,"['Harcourt, AH', 'Greenberg, J']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1006/anbe.2001.1835,NOV 2001,35,"Gorilla, Gorilla gorilla, females associate permanently with males. What benefit do the females obtain from the association? Where males are larger than females, as in the gorilla, protection from predation is the long-standing answer. However, protection from infanticidal nonfather males is increasingly suggested as a better hypothesis. Given that a female's alternative strategy is to range alone and mate with many males, a hitherto ignored problem of the anti-infanticide hypothesis is that a female's joining a single male necessarily maximizes the proportion of males in the population who can use the infanticidal strategy. To ask whether lone gorilla females could mate with enough males to decrease the probability of infanticide below that observed in the wild, we use novel modifications of a gas molecule equation to model encounter rates of a lone female with males. The modifications include separation of encounter rates in fertile periods from those in nursing periods and, importantly, a decline function that converts infanticidal males to noninfanticidal, on mating. Parameters include density of males, speed of travel, and duration of fertile and nursing periods. In two other great apes (chimpanzee Pan, orang-utan Pongo), females are more or less solitary, and infanticide rates are very low (less than or equal to5%). With these species' values in the model, equivalently low infanticide rates result. Thus, the model appears valid. For the gorilla, the model indicates that under most realistic conditions, solitary females mate with so few males that infanticide rates are more than three times the observed rate of 14% of births. Association with a male thus decreases the probability of infanticide. The anti-infanticide hypothesis for grouping is thus supported. But the antipredation hypothesis is not thereby negated, and remains a powerful hypothesis, given that predators are a danger to the female, as well as her infant.

Human models showed alternative methods and sequences for dismantling an artificial fruit to groups of participants matched by gender and age. Each participant received three to six 2-min trials in which they were given access to the artificial fruit for manipulation. Independent coders, who were unaware of which method each participant had seen, gave confidence ratings and collected action frequencies from watching video recordings of the experimental trials. No significant differences were found between groups in terms of the coders' confidence ratings, the action frequencies or the sequence of manipulations. These negative results may at least partly reflect the immaturity of a large proportion of the participants. A positive correlation was found between age and the degree of matching to the method shown. Although none of the juveniles succeeded in opening the ""fruit"", two out of the four adults did so and they also seemed to match more closely the sequence of elements touched over successive trials. The results are compared with similar data previously collected from human children, chimpanzees, gorillas, capuchin monkeys and common marmosets."
Manual dexterity in the gorilla: bimanual and digit role differentiation in a natural task.,"['Byrne, R W', 'Corp, N', 'Byrne, J M']",Animal cognition,10.1007/s100710100083,2001-Nov (Epub 2001 May 31),40,"The manipulative actions of mountain gorillas Gorilla g. beringei were examined in the context of foraging on hard-to-process plant foods in the field, in particular those used in tackling thistle Carduus nyassanus. A repertoire of 72 functionally distinct manipulative actions was recorded. Many of these actions were used in several variants of grip, finger(s) and movement path, both by different individuals and by the same individual at different times. The repertoire appears somewhat greater than that observed in comparable studies of monkeys, but a far more striking difference is found in the use of differentiated actions in concert. Mountain gorillas routinely and frequently deal with problems that involve: (1) bimanual role differentiation, with the two hands taking different roles but synchronized in time and space, and (2) digit role differentiation, with independent control of parts of the same hand used for separate purposes at the same time. The independent control that allows these abilities, so crucial to human manual constructional ability, is apparently general in African great apes. Role differentiation, between and within the hand, is evidently a primitive characteristic in the human arsenal of skills."
Human and ape molecular clocks and constraints on paleontological hypotheses,"['Stauffer, RL', 'Walker, A', 'Ryder, OA', 'Lyons-Weiler, M', 'Hedges, SB']",JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,10.1093/jhered/92.6.469,NOV-DEC 2001,81,"Although the relationships of the living hominoid primates (humans and apes) are well known, the relationships of the fossil species, times of divergence of both living and fossil species, and the biogeographic history of hominoids are not well established. Divergence times of living species, estimated from molecular clocks, have the potential to constrain hypotheses of the relationships of fossil species. In this study, new DNA sequences from nine protein-coding nuclear genes in great apes are added to existing datasets to increase the precision of molecular time estimates bearing on the evolutionary history of apes and humans. The divergence of Old World monkeys and hominoids at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary (approximately 23 million years ago) provides the best primate calibration point and yields a time and 95% confidence interval of 5.4 +/- 1.1 million years ago (36 nuclear genes) for the human-chimpanzee divergence. Older splitting events are estimated as 6.4 +/- 1.5 million years ago (gorilla, 31 genes), 11.3 +/- 1.3 million years ago (orangutan, 33 genes), and 14.9 +/- 2.0 million years ago (gibbon, 27 genes). Based on these molecular constraints, we find that several proposed phylogenies of fossil hominoid taxa are unlikely to be correct."
"Modern African ape populations as genetic and demographic models of the last common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas","['Jensen-Seaman, MI', 'Deinard, AS', 'Kidd, KK']",JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,10.1093/jhered/92.6.475,NOV-DEC 2001,34,"In order to fully understand human evolutionary history through the use of molecular data, it is essential to include our closest relatives as a comparison. We provide here estimates of nucleotide diversity and effective population size of modern African ape species using data from several independent noncoding nuclear loci, and use these estimates to make predictions about the nature of the ancestral population that eventually gave rise to the living species of African apes, including humans. Chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas possess two to three times more nucleotide diversity than modern humans. We hypothesize that the last common ancestor (LCA) of these species had an effective population size more similar to modern apes than modern humans. In addition, estimated dates for the divergence of the Homo, Pan, and Gorilla lineages suggest that the LCA may have had stronger geographic structuring to its mtDNA than its nuclear DNA, perhaps indicative of strong female philopatry or a dispersal system analogous to gorillas, where females disperse only short distances from their natal group. Synthesizing different classes of data, and the inferences drawn from them, allows us to predict some of the genetic and demographic properties of the LCA of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas."

We also constructed phylogenetic trees and networks. The two orangutan subspecies were clearly separated from each other, and Sumatran orangutans showed much higher nucleotide diversity than Bornean orangutans. Some gibbon species did not form monophyletic clusters, and variation within species was not much different from that among species in the subgenus Hylobates."
"Seed dispersal by a diurnal primate community in the Dja Reserve, Cameroon","['Poulsen, JR', 'Clark, CJ', 'Smith, TB']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,NA,NOV 2001,54,"Multiple species of primate disperse seeds and differentially contribute to the seed rain in tropical forests. The goal of this study was to examine seed dispersal by a primate community of five monkey and two ape species in the Dja Reserve, Cameroon. The density of primates in the reserve was calculated to be 77 individuals km(-2). Analysis of 5789 faecal clumps demonstrated that 40% of monkey and 74% of ape faecal clumps possessed whole seeds. Six of the seven focal species acted as seed dispersers; faecal clumps passed by the black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza) did not contain any whole seeds during the study. Seed passage trials on four captive monkey species showed monkeys to have an average seed passage time of 22 hours and defecation rate of five times per day. From the above results, the primate community was estimated to defecate 1129 seeds km(-2) d(-1). Seeds passed by the primate community came from 125 species of trees, lianas and shrubs, equivalent to at least 34% of the known tree flora. Rarefaction curves indicated that additional collection effort would identify more seed species passed by primates. Germination studies demonstrated that primate-passed seeds are viable. The number of seeds and plant species dispersed suggests that the primate community plays an important role in the maintenance of forest structure."
Evaluation of methods for determination of a reconstructed history of gene sequence evolution,"['Liberles, DA']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,NOV 2001,44,"With whole-genome sequences being completed at an increasing rate, it is important to develop and assess tools to analyze them. Following annotation of the protein content of a genome, one can compare sequences with previously characterized homologous genes to detect novel functions within specific proteins in the evolution of the newly sequenced genome. One common statistical method to detect such changes is to compare the ratios of nonsynonymous (K-a) to synonymous (K-s) nucleotide substitution rates. Here, the effects of several parameters that can influence this calculation (sequence reconstruction method, phylogenetic tree branch length weighting, GC content, and codon bias) are examined. Also, two new alternative measures of adaptive evolution, the point accepted mutations (PAM)/neutral evolutionary distance (NED) ratio and the sequence space assessment (SSA) statistic are presented. All of these methods are compared using two sequence families: the recent divergence of leptin orthologs in primates, and the more ancient divergence of the deoxyribonucleoside kinase family.

Multiple pathogenic and benign genomic rearrangements occur at a 35 kb duplication involving the NEMO and LAGE2 genes,"['Aradhya, S', 'Bardaro, T', 'Galgoczy, P', 'Yamagata, T', 'Esposito, T', 'Patlan, H', 'Ciccodicola, A', 'Munnich, A', 'Kenwrick, S', 'Platzer, M', ""D'Urso, M"", 'Nelson, DL', 'COMMON-CAUSE']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/10.22.2557,OCT 15 2001,54,"The X-linked dominant and male-lethal disorder incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is caused by mutations in a gene called NEMO(IKK-gamma). We recently reported the structure of NEMO and demonstrated that most IP patients carry an identical deletion that arises due to misalignment between repeats. Affected male abortuses with the IP deletion had provided clues that a second, incomplete copy of NEMO was present in the genome. We have now identified clones containing this truncated copy (Delta NEMO) and incorporated them into a previously constructed physical contig in distal Xq28. Delta NEMO maps 22 kb distal to NEMO and only contains exons 3-10, confirming our proposed model. A sequence of 26 kb 3 of the NEMO coding sequence is also present in the same position relative to the Delta NEMO locus, bringing the total length of the duplication to 35.5 kb. The LAGE2 gene is also located within this duplicated region, and a similar but unique LAGE1 gene is located just distal to the duplicated loci. Mapping and sequence information indicated that the duplicated regions are in opposite orientation. Analysis of the great apes suggested that the NEMO/LAGE2 duplication occurred after divergence of the lineage leading to present day humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, similar to 10-15 million years ago. Intriguingly, despite this substantial evolutionary history, only 22 single nucleotide differences exist between the two copies over the entire 35.5 kb, making the duplications > 99% identical. This high sequence identity and the inverted orientations of the two copies, along with duplications of smaller internal sections within each copy, predispose this region to various genomic alterations. We detected four rearrangements that involved NEMO, Delta NEMO or LAGE1 and LAGE2. The high sequence similarity between the two NEMO/LAGE2 copies may be due to frequent gene conversion, as we have detected evidence of sequence transfer between them. Together, these data describe an unusual and complex genomic region that is susceptible to various types of pathogenic and polymorphic rearrangements, including the recurrent lethal deletion associated with IP."

Episodic memory in primates,"['Schwartz, BL', 'Evans, S']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.1041,OCT 2001,37,"Episodic memory refers to a system of memory with the capacity to recollect specific events from an individual's life. Some psychologists have suggested that episodic memory is a uniquely human phenomenon. We challenge that idea and present evidence that great apes and other primates may possess episodic-like memory. We review criteria developed to assess episodic-like memory in nonhumans, and how they apply to primates. In particular, we discuss the criteria of Clayton et al. [2001], who stated that episodic-like memory is based on the retrieval of multiple and integrated components of an event. We then review eight studies examining memory in great apes and apply the Clayton et al. criteria to each of them. We summarize the evidence that is compatible with the existence of episodic-like memory, although none of the data completely satisfy the Clayton et al. criteria. Morover, feelings of pastness and feelings of confidence, which mark episodic memory in humans, have not been empirically addressed in nonhuman primates. Future studies should be directed at these aspects of memory in primates. We speculate on the functional significance of episodic memory in nonhuman primates. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Neuroanatomical localization of the motor hand area with magnetic resonance imaging: The left hemisphere is larger in great apes,"['Hopkins, WD', 'Pilcher, DL']",BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE,10.1037/0735-7044.115.5.1159,OCT 2001,26,"Magnetic resonance images of the brain were obtained from 2 gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), 4 orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), 14 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and 4 bonobos (Pan paniscus). The region on the motor cortex of humans identified as responsible for motor skill of the hand (the ""knob"") was identified in this sample on consecutive 1-mm axial scans. The shape of the knob area was traced on each scan from both hemispheres, and the area from all scans was summed to calculate the knob volume, The width of the knob was also measured and correlated highly with knob volume. A significant population-level leftward asymmetry in the volume and width of the knob was revealed (p < .05). Species differences in knob asymmetry and overall volume were not significant, but the variability in overall volume between species was substantial. Selection for the evolution of a neuroanatomical representation of the hand in primates and an evolutionary trend toward population-level right handedness are discussed."
CAG repeat instability at SCA2 locus: anchoring CAA interruptions and linked single nucleotide polymorphisms,"['Choudhry, S', 'Mukerji, M', 'Srivastava, AK', 'Jain, S', 'Brahmachari, SK']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/10.21.2437,OCT 2 2001,61,"Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that results from the expansion of a cryptic CAG repeat within the exon 1 of the SCA2 gene. The CAG repeat in normal individuals varies in length from 14 to 31 repeats and is frequently interrupted by one or more CAA triplets, whereas the expanded alleles contain a pure uninterrupted stretch of 34 to 59 CAG repeats. We have previously reported the presence of a limited pool of 'ancestral' or 'at risk' haplotypes for the expanded SCA2 alleles in the Indian population. We now report the identification of two novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exon 1 of the SCA2 gene and their characterization in 215 normal and 64 expanded chromosomes. The two biallelic SNPs distinguished two haplotypes, GT and CC, each of which formed a predominant haplotype associated with normal and expanded SCA2 alleles. All the expanded alleles segregated with CC haplotype, which otherwise was associated with only 29.3% of the normal chromosomes. CAA interspersion analysis revealed that majority of the normal alleles with CC haplotype were either pure or lacked the most proximal 5' CAA interruption. The repeat length variation at SCA2 locus also appeared to be polar with changes occurring mostly at the 5' end of the repeat. Our results demonstrate that CAA interruptions play an important role in conferring stability to SCA2 repeat and their absence predisposes alleles towards instability and pathological expansion. Our study also provides new haplotypes associated with SCA2 that should prove useful in further understanding the mutational history and mechanism of repeat instability at the SCA2 locus."
"Nutritional aspects of western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) diet during seasons of fruit scarcity at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic","['Remis, MJ', 'Dierenfeld, ES', 'Mowry, CB', 'Carroll, RW']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1012021617737,OCT 2001,57,"Traditionally, gorillas were classified as folivores, yet 15 years of data on western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) show their diet to contain large quantities of foliage and fruit, and to vary both seasonally and annually. The consumption of fruit by gorillas at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic, is correlated with rainfall and ripe fruit availability (Remis, 1997a). We investigated the nutritional and chemical content of gorilla foods consumed at Bai Hokou during two seasons of fruit scarcity as measured by phenological observations and compared our findings with the nutrient content of gorilla foods at other African sites. We conclude that during lean times, Bai Hokou gorillas consumed fruits with higher levels of fiber and secondary compounds than those of other populations of western lowland or mountain gorillas. Conversely, leaves consumed by Bai Hokou gorillas were relatively low in fiber and tannins. Bai Hokou gorillas appeared to meet their nutritional needs by eating a combination of fruit and foliage. They ate fruits comparatively high in secondary compounds and fiber when necessary. While gorillas are selective feeders, wherever and whenever preferred foods a re scarce, their large body size and digestive anatomy enable them to consume and process a broader repertoire of foods than smaller bodied-apes."
Developmental aspects of sexual dimorphism in hominoid canines,"['Schwartz, GT', 'Reid, DJ', 'Dean, C']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1012073601808,OCT 2001,55,"We examined the histology of canine teeth in extant hominoids and provided a comparative database on several aspects of canine development. The resultant data augment the known pattern of differences in aspects of tooth crown formation among great apes and more irnportantly, enable us to determine the underlying developmental mechanisms responsible for canine dimorphism in them. We sectioned and analyzed large sample (n = 108) of reliably-sexed great ape mandibular canines according to standard histological techniques. Using information from long- and short-period incremental markings in teeth, we recorded measurements of daily secretion rates, periodicity and linear enamel thickness for specimens of Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus and Homo sapiens. Modal values of periodicities in males and females, respectively, are: Pan 7/7; Gorilla 9/10; Pongo 10/10; and Homo 8/8. Secretion rates increase from the inner to the outer region of the enamel cap and decrease from the cuspal towards the cervical margin of the canine crown in all great ape species. Female hominoids tend to possess significantly thicker enamel than their male counterparts, which is almost certainly related to the presence of faster daily secretion rates near the enamel-dentine junction, especially in Gorilla and Pongo. Taken together, these results indicate that sexual differences in canine development are most apparent in the earlier stages of canine crown formation, while interspecific differences are most apparent in the outer crown region. When combined with results on the rate and duration of canine crown formation, the results provide essential background work for larger projects aimed at understanding the developmental basis of canine dimorphism in extant and extinct large-bodied hominoids and eventually in early hominins."
"A novel, nonclassical MHC class I molecule specific to the common chimpanzee","['Adams, EJ', 'Cooper, S', 'Parham, P']",JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY,NA,OCT 1 2001,16,"All expressed human MHC class I genes (HLA-A, -B, -C, -E, -F, and -G) have functional orthologues in the MHC of the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). In contrast, a nonclassical MHC class I gene discovered in the chimpanzee is not present in humans or the other African ape species. In exons and more so in introns, this Patr-AL gene is similar to the expressed A locus in the orangutan, Popy-A, suggesting they are orthologous. Pair-AL/Popy-A last shared a common ancestor with the classical MHC-A locus >20 million years ago. Population analysis revealed little Patr-AL polymorphism: just three allotypes differing only at residues 52 and 91. Patr-AL is expressed in PBMC and B cell lines, but at low level compared with classical MHC class I. The Patr-AL polypeptide is unusually basic, but its glycosylation, association with beta (2)-microglobulin, and antigenicity at the cell surface are like other MHC class I. No Patr-AL-mediated inhibition of polyclonal chimpanzee NK cells was detected. The Patr-AL gene is present in 50% of chimpanzee MHC haplotypes, correlating with presence of a 9.8-kb band in Southern blots. The flanking regions of Patr-AL contain repetitive/retroviral elements not flanking other class I genes. In sequenced HLA class I haplotypes, a similar element is present in the A*2901 haplotype but not the A*0201 or A*0301 haplotypes. This element, 6 kb downstream of A*2901, appears to be the relic of a human gene related to Patr-AL. Patr-AL has characteristics of a class I molecule of innate immunity with potential to provide common chimpanzees with responses unavailable to humans."
Biomechanical scaling of the hominoid mandibular symphysis,"['Daegling, DJ']",JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY,10.1002/jmor.1055,OCT 2001,38,"Experimental investigation of mandibular bone strain in cercopithecine primates has established that the mandible is bent in the transverse plane during the power stroke of mastication. Additional comparative work also supports the assumption that the morphology of the mandibular symphysis is functionally linked to the biomechanics of lateral transverse bending, or ""wishboning"" of the mandibular corpus. There are currently no experimental data to verify that lateral transverse bending constitutes an important loading regime among hominoid primates. There are, however, allometric models from cercopithecoid. primates that allow prediction of scaling patterns in hominoid mandibular dimensions that would be consistent with a mechanical environment that includes wishboning as a significant component. This study uses computed tomography (CT) scans to visualize cortical bone distribution in the anterior corpus of a sample of four genera of extant hominoids. From the cortical bone contours, area properties of the mandibular symphysis are calculated, and these variables are subjected to an allometric analysis to detect whether scaling of jaw dimensions are consistent with a wishboning loading regime. Scaling of the hominoid symphysis recalls patterns observed in cercopithecoid monkeys, which lends indirect support for the hypothesis that wishboning is an integral part of the masticatory loading environment in living apes. Inclination of the symphysis, rather than changes in cross-sectional shape or development of the superior transverse torus, represents a morphological solution for minimizing the potentially harmful effects of wishboning in the jaws of these primates.

We carried out a nest count along 94 km of transects. Also, the herbaceous vegetation of the understory was quantified and we attempted to assess the decay rate of nest sites. A total of 145 gorilla nests in 27 nest sites was found. We found 82. 1% of gorilla nests > 2 m above ground. There was a significant correlation between the height of nests and the diameter of trees with nests. The density was estimated at 0.34-0.40 weaned gorillas per km(2) depending on the value of nest site decay rate used. The herbaceous vegetation was scarce in the study site (42 out of 50 quadrats had no herbaceous stems). Compared with the gorilla population of the nearby Dzanga-Sangha forest, the population density of gorillas at Ngotto was lower but the proportion of nests found above ground was much higher. These differences are discussed and we suggest that they were the result of the scarcity of herbaceous vegetation in the Ngotto forest."

Fecal samples from female gorillas were used to examine the reliability of this non-invasive assay system, which included the extraction method for estradiol-17beta (E-2) and progesterone (P) from fecal samples. Fecal samples from three female gorillas were collected daily for about 55 days, and fecal E2 and P were assayed to clarify the fluctuation patterns of these steroids in the feces. Fecal sampling from one female was repeated for another 50-day period (starting 75 days after the end of the first observation period) and assayed to confirm if the menstrual cycle of this subject was ovulatory. Although fecal E-2 concentration measurements were quantitative by using this assay system, fecal P concentration measurements were semi-quantitative. Relative amounts of fecal P in fecal samples were estimated by using the values of B/B-0 (bound/total binding in the radioimmunoassay system). Two of the four fluctuation patterns of fecal hormones observed throughout the menstrual cycle for the three female gorillas were typical for normal ovulatory cycles. In the subject observed for two periods, one pattern was typical and the other atypical. The results show that this non-invasive method is simple and practical for monitoring the reproductive status of great apes as well as Old World monkeys."
The subspecies concept in primatology: The case of mountain gorillas,"['Stanford, CB']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02629622,OCT 2001,9,"The criteria for the application of subspecific units in living primate populations have received little attention relative to other vertebrate taxa, even though they have important implications for conservation strategies for many nonhuman primate populations. One of the most critically endangered primates is the mountain gorilla, Gorilla gorilla beringei, of which 600 animals exist in east-central Africa. Following SARMIENTO et al. (1996), taxonomists have proposed splitting these populations into two subspecies as part of a revised taxonomy of the genus Gorilla. In this paper I review the application of the subspecies concept in primatology, using the gorillas of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and the Virungas as case studies. An examination of genetic, morphological, biogeographic, ecological, and behavioral evidence indicates that reclassifying Bwindi gorillas as taxonomically distinct from those in the Virungas is not well supported and needs further study. Because taxonomy provides the basis of conservation management policies, a cautious and conservative approach to the subspecies question is warranted in the case of endangered primate populations."

Samples from the ingested termite mounds are compared with samples taken from the surrounding uneaten soils in an attempt to determine why the termitaria soils are eaten. Particle size, clay and primary mineral composition, geochemistry, and scanning electron microscopic analyses are used to search for a possible explanation for geophagy among the bonnet macaques. Kaolin minerals abound throughout the Marakkanam soil sample suite. But the termitaria soils are distinguished by the presence of small amounts of smectite. An abundance of kaolin minerals in combination with small amounts of smectite strongly resembles the mineralogy of eko, a traditional African remedy for stomach ailments, and Kaopectate(TM), a western anti-diarrhoeal preparation. The percentage of mature leaves and fruits of Azadirachta indica consumed by the bonnet macaques is relatively high. Plant feeding deterrents, such as, acid detergent fibre (ADF) and the inherent nature of the fruits of Azadirachta indica, when consumed in large quantities to act as a purgative, could cause gastrointestinal upsets and diarrhoea. At Marakkanam, bonnet macaques ingest termitaria earth that would act as a pharmaceutical agent to alleviate gastrointestinal upsets and control diarrhoea."

We have found that, although a region containing a 92-bp exon and an AluSq element in the hydroxylase gene is intact in all nonhuman primates examined, the same region in the human genome is replaced by an AluY element that was disseminated at least one million years ago. We propose a mechanistic model for this Alu-mediated replacement event, which deleted the 92-bp exon and thus inactivated the human hydroxylase gene. It is suggested that AN elements have played potentially important roles in genotypic and phenotypic evolution in the hominid lineage."
Glucocorticoid stimulates primate but inhibits rodent alpha-fetoprotein gene promoter,"['Nakabayashi, H', 'Koyama, Y', 'Sakai, M', 'Li, HM', 'Wong, NCW', 'Nishi, S']",BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS,10.1006/bbrc.2001.5564,SEP 14 2001,13,"Glucocorticoids inhibit rodent a-fetoprotein (AFP) gene activity but stimulate expression of the human homologue. Like human, activity of the AFP promoter from other primates was stimulated by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) in various cell lines. A glucocorticoid responsive element (GRE) is located within 180 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site of all AFP genes examined. Comparative analysis of the GRE in the two different groups of promoters revealed a common 3' hexamer, 5'-TGTCCT-3', but the 5' hexamers were different. This difference converts the rodent GRE to a DR-1 motif. DR-1 is a binding site for members of the nuclear receptor superfamily including the orphan receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4). The presence of DR-1 in the rodent but not human may underlie the opposite actions of Dex on the AFP promoter. We tested this hypothesis using a transient transfection assay. In hepatoma cells that expressed GR and HNF-4, reporter-activity was inhibited by Dex. The same construct in nonhepatoma cells was strongly induced by over expression of HNF-4 and the induced activity was inhibited by Dex. The findings show that Dex induction of human AFP is mediated by a GRE. But Dex repression of the rodent promoter requires a DR-1 motif that interacts with GR and HNF-4. (C) 2001 Academic Press."

We suggest how developmental and functional criteria can be used to predict where in the skeleton of fossil hominins we should expect more, or less, within-species variation. We present and test three hypotheses about the factors contributing to craniodental variation in extant primate taxa, and then apply these results to the interpretation of the P. boisei hypodigm. Within the comparative samples of extant Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, and Colobus, variables from the cranial base, neurocranium, and face that are not subject to high magnitudes of strain have consistently lower levels of intraspecific variation than variables from regions of the face subject to high levels of strain. Dental size variables are intermediate in terms of their reliability. P. boisei is found to have a low degree of variability relative to extant primates for variables shown to be generally useful for testing taxonomic hypotheses. Contrary to the claims of Suwa et al. ([1997] Nature 389:489-492), the recently discovered material from Konso falls within the range of variation of the ""pre-Konso"" hypodigm of P. boisei for available conventional metrical variables. Those aspects of the Konso material that appear to extend the range of the P. boisei hypodigm involve regions of the skull predicted to be prone to high levels of within-species variation. The approach used in this study focuses on craniodental data, but it is applicable to other regions of the skeleton. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Although the presence of two distinct lineages of KSHV-like rhadinoviruses, RV1 and RV2, has been revealed in Old World primates (including African green monkeys, macaques, and, recently, mandrills), viruses belonging to the RV2 genogroup have not yet been identified from great apes. Indeed, the three yet known gamma2-herpesviruses in chimpanzees (PanRHV1a/PtRV1, PanRHV1b) and gorillas (GorRHV1) belong to the RV1 group. To investigate the Putative existence of a new RV2 Rhadinovirus in chimpanzees and gorillas we have used the degenerate consensus primer PCR strategy for the Herpesviral DNA polymerase gene on 40 wild-caught animals. This study led to the discovery, in common chimpanzees, of a novel gamma2-herpesvirus belonging to the RV2 genogroup, termed Pan Rhadino-herpesvirus 2 (PanRHV2). Use of specific primers and internal oligonucleotide probes demonstrated the presence of this novel gamma2-herpesvirus in three wild-caught animals. Comparison of a 1092-bp fragment of the DNA polymerase obtained from these three animals of the Pan troglodytes troglodytes subspecies, one from Gabon and the two others from Cameroon, revealed <1% of nucleotide divergence. The geographic colocalization as well as the phylogenetic ""relationship"" of the human and simian gamma2-herpesviruses support the model according to which herpesviruses have diversified from a common ancestor in a manner mediating cospeciation of herpesviruses with their host species. By demonstrating the existence of two distinct Rhadinovirus lineages in common chimpanzees, our finding indicates the possible existence of a novel human gamma2-herpesvirus belonging to the RV2 genogroup."

After that, we obtained an HBsAg-positive serum sample from a chimpanzee from Central Africa, named Bassi, belonging to another subspecies (P. troglodytes troglodytes). The full-genome nucleotide sequence of the hepadnavirus from Bassi showed a significant difference (9-26%) from those so far reported from primates including humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, suggesting a novel strain. More interestingly, however, the core antigen (HBcAg) deduced from Bassi's sequence showed only 78-82% similarity to known primate strains at the amino acid level, whereas the other strains shared more than 90% similarity. HBcAg ex-pressed from Bassi HBV failed to react with monoclonal antibodies that were directed at an epitope borne by codons 135-145 of HBcAg of conventional hepadnaviruses.

Subsequent video analysis of gorillas' behavior showed a significant tendency to copy the observed technique on 1 of the individual defenses and the direction of removal on another defense.

In our previous study, we have used testis-specific protein Y (TSPY) gene sequences that have beneficial features for the resolution of the Homo-Pan-Gorilla trichotomy. To understand the phylogenetic relationships among Saimiri-Cebus-Aotus trichotomy in New World monkeys, we have sequenced the first intron of the TSPY gene from the capuchin monkeys, night monkeys, squirrel monkeys, long-haired spider monkeys, and black-handed spider monkey. The TSPY intron has diverged at 180 of the 652 nucleotides positions. The evolutionary rates of nucleotide substitutions per site per year were higher in the TSPY intron than in the ZFY intron within Y-chromosomal DNA. Phylogenetic tree by the neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony methods using the sequence divergence from the TSPY intron was constructed, suggesting that the squirrel monkey and the capuchin monkey showed a sister relationship among New World monkeys."
Mitochondrial DNA variation and biogeography of eastern gorillas,"['Jensen-Seaman, MI', 'Kidd, KK', 'GRAUERS GORILLA']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1046/j.0962-1083.2001.01365.x,SEP 2001,64,"Mitochondrial DNA variation in 109 individuals from four populations of wild living gorillas in East Africa was ascertained by sequencing the first hypervariable segment of the control region, or 'D-loop'. amplified from noninvasively collected hair and faeces. D-loop haplotypes from eastern gorillas fell into two distinct clades, each with low levels of genetic diversity; most observed haplotypes within each clade differing by only one or two mutations. Both clades show evidence of population bottlenecks in the recent past, perhaps concomitant with the tropical forest reduction and fragmentation brought on by global cooling and drying associated with the last glacial maximum."

Global analysis of ATM polymorphism reveals significant functional constraint,"['Thorstenson, YR', 'Shen, PD', 'Tusher, VG', 'Wayne, TL', 'Davis, RW', 'Chu, G', 'Oefner, PJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS,10.1086/321296,AUG 2001,74,"ATM, the gene that is mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia, is associated with cerebellar degeneration, abnormal proliferation of small blood vessels, and cancer. These clinically important manifestations have stimulated interest in defining the sequence variation in the ATM gene. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive survey of sequence variation in ATM in diverse human populations. The protein-encoding exons of the gene (9,168 bp) and the adjacent intron and untranslated sequences (14,661 bp) were analyzed in 93 individuals from seven major human populations. In addition, the coding sequence was analyzed in one chimpanzee, one gorilla, one orangutan, and one Old World monkey. In human ATM, 88 variant sites were discovered by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, which is 96%-100% sensitive for detection of DNA sequence variation. ATM was compared to 14 other autosomal genes for nucleotide diversity. The noncoding regions of ATM had diversity values comparable to other genes, but the coding regions had very low diversity, especially in the last 29% of the protein sequence. A test of the neutral evolution hypothesis, through use of the Hudson/Kreitman/Aguade' statistic, revealed that this region of the human ATM gene was significantly constrained relative to that of the orangutan, the Old World monkey, and the mouse, but not relative to that of the chimpanzee or the gorilla. ATM displayed extensive linkage disequilibrium, consistent with suppression of meiotic recombination at this locus. Seven haplotypes were defined. Two haplotypes accounted for 82% of all chromosomes analyzed in all major populations; two others carrying the same D126E missense polymorphism accounted for 33% of chromosomes in Africa but were never observed outside of Africa. The high frequency of this polymorphism may be due either to a population expansion within Africa or to selective pressure."
A survey assessment of variables related to stereotypy in captive giraffe and okapi,"['Bashaw, MJ', 'Tarou, LR', 'Maki, TS', 'Maple, TL']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/S0168-1591(01)00137-X,AUG 1 2001,38,"Stereotypic behavior has been investigated in a wide variety of animals, but little published information is available on this problem in captive exotic ungulates. A survey was used to gather information on the prevalence of stereotypic behavior in giraffe and okapi and to identify variables associated with these behaviors. Of the 71 institutions that received a survey, 69.0% responded. Data were reported for 257 individuals, including 214 giraffe (representing five subspecies) and 29 okapi. Of the animals included in the survey, 79.7% performed at least one type of stereotypic behavior. Licking of non-food objects (72.4%) and pacing (29.2%) were the most prevalent stereotypic behaviors, though other stereotypies were reported in 3.2% of the animals. The results of a logistic regression performed on the data indicated that sub species, number of hours the individuals spent indoors, access at night to conspecifics, feeding frequency, method of feeding, and type of food provided were predictors of stereotypic licking. Sub species, birth history, size of the indoor enclosure, environmental change, and type of food provided were found to be significant predictors of stereotypic pacing. In general, feeding motivation appears to be related to an oral stereotypy, whereas other environmental factors appear to be associated with a locomotor stereotypy. The results of this study suggest changes in management strategies that may be empirically studied and applied to improve the well-being of captive populations of giraffe and okapi.

Male and female strategies during intergroup encounters in guerezas (Colobus guereza): evidence for resource defense mediated through males and a comparison with other primates,"['Fashing, PJ']",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,10.1007/s002650100358,AUG 2001,76,"Although socioecological theory predicts that differences in male and female parental investment will be reflected in their behavior during intergroup encounters, the strategies actually pursued by adults of each sex during intergroup encounters remain poorly known for most primate species. Over an 11-month period, I examined the functions of adult male and female participation in intergroup aggression in five groups of eastern black-and-white colobus monkeys, or guerezas (Colobus guereza), in the Kakamega Forest, Kenya. Guerezas are large-bodied arboreal African colobine monkeys that usually live in one-male multifemale groups, though multimale multifemale groups are not uncommon. During 174 study days, I observed 136 encounters, most of which were aggressive in nature. I evaluated the hypotheses that through intergroup aggression (1) males were directly defending mates, (2) males were indirectly defending mates by directly defending food resources, (3) males were attempting to attract mates via infanticide, and/or (4) females were defending food resources. I found strong evidence consistent with both the direct male mate defense and indirect male mate defense via resource defense hypotheses, but no evidence consistent with the male mate attraction via infanticide hypothesis. There was little evidence in favor of the female resource defense hypothesis beyond the fact that females occasionally participated in intergroup aggression in four of the five study groups. A review of the most intensive studies of primate intergroup encounters suggests that direct male mate defense may occur in almost all primate species, while female resource defense appears to be most common in species with high levels of female philopatry. The indirect male mate defense via resource defense strategy has rarely been evaluated and may be a more common male strategy than is currently believed. I present a hypothesis that predicts when male primates are expected to defend resources for females in their group."
Alpha-satellite DNA of primates: old and new families,"['Alexandrov, I', 'Kazakov, A', 'Tumeneva, I', 'Shepelev, V', 'Yurov, Y']",CHROMOSOMA,10.1007/s004120100146,AUG 2001,81,"In this report we review a-satellite DNA (AS) sequence data to support the following proposed scenario of AS evolution. Centromeric regions of lower primate chromosomes have solely ""old"" AS based on type A monomeric units. Type A AS is efficiently homogenized throughout the whole genome and is nearly identical in all chromosomes. In the ancestors of great apes, a divergent variant of the type A monomer acquired the ability to bind CENP-B protein and expanded in the old arrays, mixing irregularly with type A. As a result, a new class of monomers, called type B, was formed. The ""new"" AS families were established by amplification of divergent segments of irregular A-B arrays and spread to many chromosomes before the human-chimpanzee-gorilla split. The new arrays contain regularly alternating monomers of types A and B. New AS is homogenized within an array with little or no homogenization between chromosomes. Most human chromosomes contain only one new array and one or a few old arrays. However, as a rule only new arrays are efficiently homogenized. Apparently, in evolution, after the establishment of the new arrays homogenization in the old arrays stopped. Notably, kinetochore structures marking functional centromeres are also usually formed on the new arrays. We propose that homogenization of AS may be limited to arrays participating in centromeric function."
Species-specific evolution of repeated DNA sequences in great apes,"['Toder, R', 'Grutzner, F', 'Haaf, T', 'Bausch, E']",CHROMOSOME RESEARCH,10.1023/A:1011605824530,AUG 2001,5,"DNA sequencing reveals that the genomes of the human, gorilla and chimpanzee share more than 98% homology. Comparative chromosome painting and gene mapping have demonstrated that only a few rearrangements of a putative ancestral mammalian genome occurred during great ape and human evolution. However, interspecies representational difference analysis (RDA) of the gorilla between human and gorilla revealed gorilla-specific DNA sequences. Cloning and sequencing of gorilla-specific DNA sequences indicate that there are repetitive elements. Gorilla-specific DNA sequences were mapped by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) to the subcentromeric/centromeric regions of three pairs of gorilla submetacentric chromosomes. These sequences could represent either ancient sequences that got lost in other species, such as human and orang-utan, or, more likely, recent sequences which evolved or originated specifically in the gorilla genome."
Excess of rare amino acid polymorphisms in the toll-like receptor 4 in humans,"['Smirnova, I', 'Hamblin, MT', 'McBride, C', 'Beutler, B', 'Di Rienzo, A']",GENETICS,NA,AUG 2001,98,"The Toll-like receptor 4 protein acts as the transducing subunit of the lipopolysaccharide receptor complex and assists in (fie detection of Gram-negative pathogens within the mammalian host. Several lines of evidence support the view that variation at the TLR4 locus may alter host susceptibility to Gram-negative infection or the outcome of infection. Here, we surveyed TLR4 sequence variation in the complete-coding region (2.4 kb) in 348 individuals from several population samples; in addition, a subset of the individuals was surveyed at 1.1 kb of intronic sequence. More than 90% of the chromosomes examined encoded the same structural isoform of TLR4, while the rest harbored 12 rare amino acid variants. Conversely, the variants at silent sites (intronic and synonymous positions) occur at both low and high frequencies and are consistent with a neutral model of mutation and random drift. The spectrum of allele frequencies for amino acid variants shows a significant skew toward lower frequencies relative to both the neutral model and the pattern observed at linked silent sites. This is consistent with the hypothesis weak purifying selection acted oil TLR4 and that most mutations affecting TLR4 protein structure have at least mildly deleterious phenotypic effects. These results may imply that genetic variants contributing to disease susceptibility occur at low frequencies in the population and suggest strategies for optimizing the design of disease-mapping studies."
Sequence variation within the fragile x locus,"['Mathews, DJ', 'Kashuk, C', 'Brightwell, G', 'Eichler, EE', 'Chakravarti, A']",GENOME RESEARCH,NA,AUG 2001,10,"The human genome provides a reference sequence, which is a template for resequencing studies that aim to discover and interpret the record of common ancestry that exists in extant genomes. To understand the nature and pattern of variation and linkage disequilibrium comprising this history, we present a study of similar to 31 kb spanning an similar to 70 kb region of FMR1, sequenced in a sample of 20 humans (worldwide sample) and four great apes (chimp, bonobo, and gorilla). Twenty-five polymorphic sites and two insertion/deletions, distributed in It unique haplotypes, were identified among humans. Africans are the only geographic group that do not share any haplotypes with other groups. Parsimony analysis, reveals two main clades and suggests that the four major human geographic groups are distributed throughout the phylogenetic tree and within each major clade. An African sample appears to be most closely related to the common ancestor shared with the three other geographic groups. Nucleotide diversity, pi, for this sample is 2.63 +/- 6.28 x 10(-4). The mutation rate, mu, is 6.48 x 10(-10) per base pair per year, giving an ancestral population size of similar to 6200 and a time to the most recent common ancestor of similar to 320,000 +/- 72,000 per base pair per year. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) at the FMR1 locus, evaluated by conventional LD analysis and by the length of segment shared between any two chromosomes, is extensive across the region."

These neurons were rare in orangutans, more numerous in gorillas and common chimpanzees, while humans had the highest numbers. These calretinin-containing pyramidal cells were not observed in the cingulate cortex of any other primate or mammalian species. This finding, together with other recent observations on the hominoid cingulate cortex, is interesting when considering primate neocortical evolution, as it indicates possible adaptive and anatomical modifications in a cortical region critical for the integration of many aspects of autonomic function, vocalization, and cognitive processes.

Ontogeny of canine dimorphism in extant hominoids,"['Schwartz, GT', 'Dean, C']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.1081,JUL 2001,41,"Many behavioral and ecological factors influence the degree of expression of canine dimorphism for different reasons. Regardless of its socioecological importance, we know virtually nothing about the processes responsible for the development of canine dimorphism. Our aim here is to describe the developmental process(es) regulating canine dimorphism in extant hominoids, using histological markers of tooth growth. Teeth preserve a permanent record of their ontogeny in the form of short- and long-period incremental markings in both enamel and dentine. We selected 52 histological sections of sexed hominoid canine teeth from a total sample of 115, from which we calculated the time and rate of cuspal enamel formation and the rate at which ameloblasts differentiate along the future enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) to the end of crown formation. Thus, we were able to reconstruct longitudinal growth curves for height attainment in male and female hominoid canines. Male hominoids consistently take longer to form canine crowns than do females (although not significantly so for our sample of Home). Male orangutans and gorillas occasionally take up to twice as long as females to complete enamel formation. The mean ranges of female canine crown formation times are similar in Pan, Gorilla, and Pongo. Interspecific differences between female Pan canine crown heights and those of Gorilla and Porzgo, which are taller, result from differences in rates of growth. Differences in canine crown heights between male Pan and the taller, more dimorphic male Gorilla and Pongo canines result both from differences in total time taken to form enamel and from faster rates of growth in Gorilla and Pongo. Although modern human canines do not emerge as significantly dimorphic in this study, it is well-known that sexual dimorphism in canine crown height exists. Larger samples of sexed modern human canines are therefore needed to identify clearly what underlies this. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Phenetic trees confirm a morphological gradient from neonate to adult, with more obvious sexual dimorphism in gorillas. By quantifying morphological change through vector field, the spatial arrangement of cranio-facial growth in the two species can be represented and compared. We conclude that differences in the timing of development (acceleration, pie-displacement, rate hypermorphosis by acceleration and time hypermorphosis by post-displacement) give rise to the intra- and interspecific variation observed in the ""great apes"" ontogenetic plan.

Seventy-six polymorphic sites were found among the human sequences and the average nucleotide diversity (pi) was 0.141%, one of the highest among all studies of nuclear sequence variation in humans. Opposite to the pattern observed in the MC1R coding region, in the present region a is highest in Africans (0.136%) compared to Asians (0.116%) and Europeans (0.122%). The distributions of pi, theta, and Fu and Li's F-statistic are nonuniform along the sequence and among continents. The pattern of genetic variation is consistent with a population expansion in Africans. We also suggest a possible phase of population size reduction in non-Africans and purifying selection acting in the middle subregion and parts of the 5 ' subregion in Africans. We hypothesize diversifying selection acting on some sites in the 5 ' and 3 ' subregions or in the MC1R coding region in Asians and Europeans, though we cannot reject the possibility of relaxation of functional constraints in the MC1R gene in Asians and Europeans. The mutation rate in the sequenced region is 1.65 X 10(-9) per site per year. The age of the most recent common ancestor for this region is similar to that for the other long noncoding regions studied to date, providing evidence for ancient gene genealogies. Our population screening and phylogenetic footprinting suggest potentially important sites for the MC1R promoter function."
The evolutionary chromosome translocation 4;19 in Gorilla gorilla is associated with microduplication of the chromosome fragment syntenic to sequences surrounding the human proximal CMT1A-REP,"['Stankiewicz, P', 'Park, SS', 'Inoue, K', 'Lupski, JR']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.181101,JUL 2001,73,"Many genomic disorders occur as a result of chromosome rearrangements involving low-copy repeats (LCRs). To better understand the molecular basis of chromosome rearrangements, including translocations, we have investigated the mechanism of evolutionary rearrangements. In contrast to several intrachromosomal rearrangements, only two evolutionary translocations have been identified by cytogenetic analyses of humans and greater apes. Human chromosome 2 arose as a result of a telomeric fusion between acrocentric chromosomes, whereas chromosomes 4 and 19 in Gorilla gorilla are the products of a reciprocal translocation between ancestral chromosomes, syntenic to human chromosomes 5 and 17, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to characterize the breakpoints of the latter translocation at the molecular level. We identified three BAC clones that span translocation breakpoints. One breakpoint occurred in the region syntenic to human chromosome 5q13.3, between the HMG-CoA reductase gene (HMGCR) and RAS p21 protein activator 1 gene (RASA1). The second breakpoint was in a region syntenic to human chromosome 17p12 containing the 24 kb region-specific low-copy repeat-proximal CMTIA-REP. Moreover, we found that the t(4;19) is associated with a submicroscopic chromosome duplication involving a 19p chromosome fragment homologous to the human chromosome region surrounding the proximal CMTIA-REP. These observations further indicate that higher order genomic architecture involving low-copy repeats resulting from genomic duplication plays a significant role in karyotypic evolution."
"""Bar-coding"" primate chromosomes: molecular cytogenetic screening for the ancestral hominoid karyotype","['Muller, S', 'Wienberg, J']",HUMAN GENETICS,NA,JUL 2001,60,"Two recently introduced multicolor FISH approaches, cross-species color banding (also termed Rx-FISH) and multiplex FISH using painting probes derived from somatic cell hybrids retaining fragments of human chromosomes, were applied in a comparative molecular cytogenetic study of higher primates. We analyzed these ""chromosome bar code"" patterns to obtain an overview of chromosomal rearrangements that occurred during higher primate evolution. The objective was to reconstruct the ancestral genome organization of hominoids using the macaque as outgroup species. Approximately 160 individual and discernible molecular cytogenetic markers were assigned in these species. Resulting comparative maps allowed us to identify numerous intra-chromosomal rearrangements, to discriminate them from previous contradicting chromosome banding interpretations and to propose an ancestral karyotype for hominoids. From 25 different chromosome forms in an ancestral karyotype for all hominoids of 2N=48 we propose 21. Probes for chromosomes 2p, 4, 9 and Y were not informative in the present experiments. The orangutan karyotype was very similar to the proposed ancestral organization and conserved 19 of the 21 ancestral forms; thus most chromosomes were already present in early hominoid evolution, while African apes and human show various derived changes."

We describe the range of DNA amounts obtained from chimpanzee faeces and shed hair samples and formulate a new efficient approach for accurate microsatellite genotyping. Prescreening of extracts for DNA quantity is recommended for sorting of samples for likely success and reliability. Repetition of results remains extensive for analysis of microsatellite amplifications beginning from low starting amounts of DNA, but is reduced for those with higher DNA content."

Sequences of two human genome fragments that were homologous to the LTR-flanking sequences were found in human genome databases: (1) an LTR-containing DNA fragment from region 3p13 of the human genome, which includes clusters of olfactory receptor genes and pseudogenes; and (2) a fragment of region 21q22.1 lacking LTR sequences. PCR analysis demonstrated that LTRs with highly homologous flanking sequences could be found in the genomes of human, chimp, gorilla, and orangutan, but were absent from the genomes of gibbon and New World monkeys. A PCR assay with a primer set corresponding to the sequence from human Chr 3 allowed us to detect LTR-containing paralogous sequences on human chromosomes 3, 4, 7, and 11. The divergence times for the LTR-flanking sequences on chromosomes 3 and 7, and the paralogous sequence on chromosome 21, were evaluated and used to reconstruct the order of duplication events and retroviral insertions. (1) An initial duplication event that occurred 14-17 Mya - and before LTR insertion - produced two loci, one corresponding to that located on Chr 21, while the second was the ancestor of the loci on chromosomes 3 and 7.

The infant gorilla responded differently to two types of maternal separation. When she remained alone for a few hours, she cried repeatedly and moved restlessly, indicating protest. Upon reunion and also for a few days thereafter, an intensification of the mother-infant relationship occurred. On the other hand, when she was separated from her mother but remained with the other group members for nine days, she did not display any behaviors that could be characterized as protest, but rather showed clear behavioral depression. During the 9-day separation period, she hardly played with other group members but she developed affiliative relationships with the leading male. After the reunion from the 9-day separation, she spent as much time near her mother as before separation and played with other infants at a level similar to that before separation, while she sometimes displayed behavioral patterns demanding the maintenance of physical contact with her mother. The present findings are compared with other reports in great apes and human children."

Using this method, we were able to distinguish human samples from those of 21 kinds of animals: the crab-eating monkey, horse, cow, sheep, goat, pig, wild boar, dog, raccoon dog, cat, rabbit, guinea pig, hamster, rat, mouse, whale, chicken, pigeon, turtle, frog, and tuna. However, we were unable to distinguish between human and gorilla samples.

Growth curves were fitted to serial measures of cephalo-thoracic-abdominal length, arm length, leg length, head circumference, upper arm circumference, and weight from each gorilla, to describe individual patterns of variation in skeletal growth and body composition. Growth in skeletal measures tended to be curvilinear to varying degrees over the first year of life. Body composition varied more than skeletal measures throughout the first year as a consequence of individual health status.

In this study, Fligner and Killeen, coefficient of variation (CV)-based and average taxonomic distance (ATD)-based bootstrap tests, were used to compare variation in size and shape of the mandibular corpus remains attributed to P. boisei s.s, with the variation observed in samples of great apes and modern humans. The degree of size variation in the P. boisei s.s. mandibular hypodigm is never observed in human and chimpanzee samples, is rare in gorillas, but is not uncommon in orangutans. However, the shape variation in the fossil group is comparable to the variation in the extant reference groups. Although the size variation in P. boisei s.s. is substantial, it is exaggerated by the effects of taphonomy. The small mandibles are more often abraded, whereas the large mandibles are more likely to have been infiltrated with matrix. On the basis of the results of this investigation of the mandibular corpus, there are no grounds for rejecting the ""single-species"" hypothesis for P. boisei s.s. When Sokal and Braumann's adjusted CV values were used to predict the index of sexual dimorphism (ISD) for the P. boisei s.s., despite the substantial geological time embraced by the mandibular corpus hypodigm, the predicted value of InISD, when corrected for taphonomic factors, is comparable to the sexual dimorphism observed within Gorilla.

L. albigena were found to have omnivorous feeding habits, consuming the fruits, seeds, leaves, and flowers of 132 plant species. Although monkeys fed from many plant species, only five plant species accounted for 45% of all feeding records. The number of feeding observations on a plant species was significantly correlated with its fruit production. L. albigena responded to fruit-lean periods by shifting from a diet dominated by fruit to one dominated by seeds, flowers, and young leaves, This diet shift coincided with greater use of swamp habitat and higher dietary diversity. L. albigena spent the greatest percentage of scan samples feeding and traveling, but activities varied significantly over the day. Individuals spent a significantly higher percentage of scan samples feeding during the fruit-rich season than in the fruit-lean season. Comparing our results to those of studies in Gabon and Uganda, we found that L. albigena differ across regions in the number of plant species they consume and time spent feeding. These differences may be a result of variations in tree diversity or the strength of seasonal fluctuations in resource abundance among sites. Am. J. Primatol. 54:91-105, 2001.

"Density estimation of bonobos (Pan paniscus) in Salonga National Park, Congo","['Van Krunkelsven, E']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00216-0,JUN 2001,12,"In December 1997 and January 1998 a survey was conducted to investigate the presence of bonobos (Pan paniscus) in the northern sector of Salonga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The park is the largest African rainforest reserve, and was created in 1970 to protect endemic species such as the bonobo. Until now, however, no one has verified whether bonobos live in the park in viable numbers. Bonobo nests were therefore counted at three sites on the rivers Yenge and Salonga, along a total of 7.5 km line transects. Bonobo density in this area was found to be 1.15 animals per square km, lower than densities found in the Lomako Forest and Wamba, between 200 and 300 km north of the park, but higher than those found in Yalosidi and Lilungu, ca. 100 km east and 150 km north-east of the park, respectively. However, hunting pressure was significant in the park, and the ongoing war does not improve the situation. The Salonga National Park is the only area in bonobo territory that is at least theoretically protected by law. Active conservation programs to protect bonobos should be undertaken as soon as the situation in the country permits. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."
Sequence variation in humans and other primates at six short tandem repeat loci used in forensic identity testing,"['Lazaruk, K', 'Wallin, J', 'Holt, C', 'Nguyen, T', 'Walsh, PS']",FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL,10.1016/S0379-0738(00)00388-1,JUN 1 2001,49,"A large number of alleles from the six different short tandem repeat (STR) loci FGA, D3S1358, vWA, CSF1PO, TPOX and TH01, used in human identity testing were sequenced to provide support for the robustness of fluorescent STR DNA typing by allele size. Sequence information for some of these loci (FGA, vWA, TH01) is an extension of published work, whereas no extensive sequence information is available with respect to the D3S1358, CSF1PO, and TPOX loci. Sequencing of alleles at each locus has provided quantitative data with respect to the true nucleotide length of common alleles, and of alleles that vary in length from the common alleles. All alleles that were identified as ""off-ladder"" alleles through fluorescent typing at these STR loci have proven to be true length variant alleles. Sequencing at the D3S1358 and CSF1PO loci allowed for the establishment of a common nomenclature for these loci. A correlation between percent stutter and the length of the core tandem repeat is demonstrated at the FGA locus. Alleles in which the core tandem repeat is interrupted by a repeat unit of different sequence have a reduced percent stutter. DNA samples from three non-human primates (chimpanzee, orangutan, and gorilla) were compared to the human sequences, and shown to differ markedly across loci with respect to their homology. The effects of primer binding site mutations on the amplification efficiency at a particular locus, and methods used to interpret amplification imbalance of heterozygous alleles at a locus is also addressed.

In an effort to identify Y-linked, testis-expressed genes, a cDNA selection library was generated by selecting testis cDNA with Y-cosmid clones. Resultant clones containing repetitive or vector material were eliminated, and 79 of the remaining clones were sequenced. Nineteen cDNAs showed homology with the TTY2 gene, and indicated that TTY2 is part of a large gene family. Screening of a panel of Y-linked cosmids revealed that the TTY2 gene family includes at least 26 members organized in 14 subfamilies. Further investigation revealed that TTY2 genes are arranged in tandemly arrayed clusters on both arms of the Y chromosome, and each gene comprises a series of tandemly arranged repeats. RT-PCR studies for two of these genes revealed that they are expressed in adult and fetal testis, as well as in the adult kidney. None of the genes investigated in derail contain an open reading Frame. We conclude that the TTY2 gene family is composed of multiple copies, some of which may function as noncoding RNA transcripts and some may be pseudogenes."
Sequence variability of a human pseudogene,"['Martinez-Arias, R', 'Calafell, F', 'Mateu, E', 'Comas, D', 'Andres, A', 'Bertranpetit, J', 'GAUCHER-DISEASE']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.GR-1677RR,JUN 2001,41,"We have obtained haplotypes from the autosomal glucocerebrosidase pseudogene (psGBA) for 100 human chromosomes from worldwide populations, as well as for four chimpanzee and four gorilla chromosomes. In humans, in a 5420-nucleotide stretch analyzed, variation comprises 17 substitutions, a 3-bp deletion, and a length polymorphism at a polyadenine tract. The substitution rate on the pseudogene (1.23 +/- 0.22 x 10(-9) per nucleotide and year) is within the range of previous estimates considering phylogenetic estimations. Recombination within the pseudogene was recognized, although the low variability of this locus prevented an accurate measure of recombination rates. At least 13% of the psGBA sequence could be attributed to gene conversion from the contiguous GBA gene, whereas the reciprocal event has been shown to lead to Gaucher disease. Human psGBA sequences showed a recent coalescence time (similar to 200,000 yr ago), acid the most ancestral haplotype was found only in Africans; both observations are compatible with the replacement hypothesis of human origins. In a deeper timeframe, phylogenetic analysis showed that the duplication event that created psGBA could be dated at similar to 27 million years ago, in agreement with previous estimates."
Habitat use and structural preferences of captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla): Effects of environmental and social variables,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Hoff, MP', 'Maple, TL']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1010707712728,JUN 2001,25,"Exhibit naturalism has become the architectural standard for Mew zoo exhibits, yet our scientific understanding of how animals interact with naturalistic environments is very limited. Given the expense incurred in building new exhibits, it is essential that more information on animal-environment interactions be obtained and that it be incorporated at the outset into exhibit designs. We documented four years of habitat use and structure preferences of western lowland gorillas at Zoo Atlanta. We found that quality of space rather than quantity of space was important, as subjects spent 50% of their time in < 15% of the exhibits. Subjects showed strong preferences for the areas near structures, particularly the holding building, and spent significantly less time away from structures than expected. Temperature interacted with structural preferences in that the subjects spent more time away front structures when temperatures were cold and more time near them when temperatures were hot. There was no difference in habitat use and structural preferences due to age, sex, and rearing history, but social factors appear to play a role. Our results are similar to those found a decade earlier in the same population and to other studies of space use in apes but are the first to include significant temperature effects. Additionally, they suggest that managers and designers need to take into account factors such ns quality of space, attractivensss of the holding building, and the interaction of structural preferences with variables such as temperature and social factors when designing exhibits."
"A HERV-K provirus in chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas, but not humans","['Barbulescu, M', 'Turner, G', 'Su, M', 'Kim, R', 'Jensen-Seaman, MI', 'Deinard, AS', 'Kidd, KK', 'Lenz, J']",CURRENT BIOLOGY,10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00227-5,MAY 15 2001,15,"Evidence from DNA sequencing studies strongly indicated that humans and chimpanzees are more closely related to each other than either is to gorillas [1-4]. However, precise details of the nature of the evolutionary separation of the lineage leading to humans from those leading to the African great apes have remained uncertain. The unique insertion sites of endogenous retroviruses, like those of other transposable genetic elements, should be useful for resolving phylogenetic relationships among closely related species. We identified a human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) provirus that is present at the orthologous position in the gorilla and chimpanzee genomes, but not in the human genome. Humans contain an intact preintegration site at this locus. These observations provide very strong evidence that, for some fraction of the genome, chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas are more closely related to each other than they are to humans. They also show that HERV-K replicated as a virus and reinfected the germline of the common ancestor of the four modern species during the period of time when the lineages were separating and demonstrate the utility of using HERV-K to trace human evolution."
"Human genetic disorders, a phylogenetic perspective","['Martinez, J', 'Dugaiczyk, LJ', 'Zielinski, R', 'Dugaiczyk, A']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,10.1006/jmbi.2001.4755,MAY 11 2001,12,"When viewed from the perspective of time, human genetic disorders give new insights into their etiology and evolution. Here, we have correlated a specific set of Alu repetitive DNA elements, known to be the basis of certain genetic defects, with their phylogenetic roots in primate evolution. From a differential distribution of Alu repeats among primate species, we identify the phylogenetic roots of three human genetic diseases involving the LPL, ApoB, and HPRT genes. The different phylogenetic age of these genetic disorders could explain the different susceptibility of various primate species to genetic diseases. Our results show that LPL deficiency is the oldest and should affect humans, apes, and monkeys. ApoB deficiency should affect humans and great apes, while a disorder in the HPRT gene (leading to the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) is unique to human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. Similar results can be obtained for cancer. We submit that de novo transpositions of Alu elements, and saltatory appear ances of Alu-mediated genetic disorders, represent singularities, places where behavior changes suddenly. Alus' propensity to spread, not only increased the regulatory and developmental complexity of the primate genome, it also increased its instability and susceptibility to genetic defects and cancer. The dynamic spread not only provided markers of primate phylogeny, it must have actively shaped the course of that phylogeny. (C) 2001 Academic Press."
"Post-conflict behaviour of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the Budongo Forest, Uganda","['Arnold, K', 'Whiten, A']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/156853901316924520,MAY 2001,60,"Since de Waal & van Roosmalen (1979) first documented the occurrence of reconciliation between former opponents in captive chimpanzees, the study of the post-conflict behaviour of primates has provided valuable information about some of the details of primate social organisation. The vast majority of these studies have been carried out on captive subjects and it has been assumed that these findings are representative of wild primates. We set out to investigate whether this was true for the Sonso community of wild chimpanzees (Pall troglodytes schweinfurthii) of the Budongo Forest, Uganda, using controlled procedures comparable with those used in captive studies. We found that these chimpanzees were much less likely to reconcile than their captive counterparts. Only one dimension of relationship quality had an effect on the likelihood of reconciliation. Individuals which were highly compatible, in terms of time spent affiliating, reconciled conflicts more often than those with weak relationships. Captive chimpanzees have also been shown to 'console' one another (de Waal & van Roosmalen, 1979; do Waal & Aureii, 1996), where uninvolved bystanders initiate affiliative contacts with victims of aggression. This study did not confirm that consolatory behaviour was characteristic of wild chimpanzee post-conflict behaviour. Nor did these chimpanzees use explicit gestures during post-conflict interactions as they have been shown to do in two out of three captive studies. We conclude that the post-conflict behaviour of chimpanzees is more variable than has previously been thought and is likely to be dependent on the prevailing social environment."
Human intrachromosomal telomeric-like repeats: sequence organization and mechanisms of origin,"['Azzalin, CM', 'Nergadze, SG', 'Giulotto, E']",CHROMOSOMA,10.1007/s004120100135,MAY 2001,100,"The intrachromosomal location of (T(2)AG(3))(n) telomeric sequences has been reported in several species. It was proposed that interstitial telomeres (ITs) originated through telomeric fusion of ancestral chromosomes. However, the data so far obtained derive mainly from cytogenetic observations. Cloning and database searching of human IT sequences allowed us to identify three classes: (i) short ITs, composed of few, essentially exact T2AG3 units; (ii) subtelomeric ITs, composed of larger arrays (several hundred base pairs) including many degenerate units within subtelomeric domains; (iii) fusion ITs, in which two extended stretches of telomeric repeats are oriented head-to-head. The number of short ITs is over 50 and subtelomeric ITs are probably present at all chromosomal ends. Surprisingly, the telomeric sequence in 2q13 remains the only fusion IT so far characterized, and evidence presented here suggests that another member of this class may be present in 1q41. Different molecular mechanisms generated the three classes. In particular, several short ITs interrupt precisely repetitive elements or are flanked by direct repeats of 10-41 bp, and are conserved in gorilla and chimpanzee. These features strongly suggest that telomeric repeats were inserted at intrachromosomal sites through the repair of double-strand breaks that occurred in the germline during evolution."

It becomes, instead, ""not really real,"" because it has had to be relegated to ""not really me"" in order for the child to preserve his attachment bond with significant others. However, it will continue to make its presence known through being relationally enacted, dissociatively, in ways that eventually become repetitious enough and painful enough to bring the child (now an adult) into our office years later.

Estimating the complexity of animal behaviour: How mountain gorillas eat thistles,"['Byrne, RW', 'Corp, N', 'Byrne, JME']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/156853901750382142,APR 2001,33,"Mountain gorillas use elaborate, multi-stage procedures for dealing with plant defences. This paper investigates the use of mathematically-inspired, informational measures to gauge the complexity of one of these tasks, eating thistle Carduus nyassanus, from field observations of 38 adults and juveniles. Behaviour was analysed at two levels, a detailed, movement-based description of the form of actions, and an organizational description of techniques that were composed of a series of many actions. Complexity, as measured by counting the sizes of behavioural repertoires, correlated at the two levels. Repertoires were shown to be incomplete, but the rates of cumulative increase in actions differed between tasks. Thistle eating was the most complex, and apparently involved many more actions than even chimpanzee tool-use. Techniques were highly selective arrangements of actions, so that their organization (sequence, bimanual coordination, hierarchical structure) reflected cognitive capacity. Although ideally it would preferable to estimate complexity of task organization, this may seldom be feasible, and was not in this case. Instead, the length of a regularly occurring sequence of actions may be the best practical estimate of an underlying complexity of mental process. Confidence in this measure will be increased if it broadly agrees with other, independent estimates of task complexity; in the case of gorilla plant processing, both the size of repertoire of functionally distinct actions and the degree of lateral specialization were, like sequence length, greater for thistle processing than for other tasks studied to date."
Morphometric variation in the hominoid orbital aperture: a case study with implications for the use of variable characters in Miocene catarrhine systematics,"['Seiffert, ER', 'Kappelman, J']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.2000.0455,APR 2001,9,"Variable characters are ubiquitous in hominoid systematics and present a number of unique problems for phylogenetic analyses that include extinct taxa. As yet, however, few studies have quantified ranges of variation in complex morphometric characters within extant taxa and then used those data to assess the consistency with which discrete character states can be applied to poorly represented fossil species. In this study, ranges of intrageneric morphometric variation in the shape of the hominoid orbital aperture are estimated using exact randomization of average pairwise taxonomic distances (ATDs) derived from size-adjusted centroid, height-width, and elliptic Fourier (EF) variables. Using both centroid and height-width variables, 19 of the 21 possible ATDs between individuals representing seven extinct catarrhine taxa (Aegyptopithecus, Afropithecus, Ankarapithecus, Ouranopithecus, Paranthropus, Sivapithecus and Turkanapithecus) can be observed within a single extant hominoid subspecies, although generally with low probabilities. A resampling study is employed as a means for gauging the effect that this intrataxonomic variation may have on the consistency with which discrete orbital shape character states can be delimited given the small sample sizes available for most Miocene catarrhine taxa preserving this feature (i.e., n = 1). For each type of morphometric variable, 100 cluster (UPGMA) analyses of pairwise ATDs are performed in which a single individual is randomly selected from each hominoid genus and analyzed alongside known extinct taxa; consensus trees are computed in order to obtain the frequencies with which different shape clusters appeared in each of the three analyses. The two major clusters appearing most frequently in all three consensus trees are found in only 57% (centroid variables), 49% (height-width variables), and 36% (EF variables) of these trees. If ranges of variation within represented extinct taxa could also be estimated, these frequencies would certainly be far lower, Hominoids clearly exhibit considerable intrageneric, intraspecific, and even intrasubspecific Variation in orbit shape, and substantial morphometric overlap exists between taxa; consequently, discrete character states delimiting these patterns of continuous variation are likely to be highly unreliable in phylogenetic analyses of living and extinct species, particularly as the number of terminal taxa increases. Morphological phylogenetic studies of extant catarrhines that assess the effect of different methods (e.g., use of objective a priori weighting or frequency coding of variable characters, inclusion vs. exclusion of variable characters, use of specific vs, supraspecific terminal taxa) on phylogenetic accuracy may help to improve the techniques that systematists employ to make phylogenetic inferences about extinct taxa.

The prevalence of positive specimens was not related to the year of habituation of a gorilla group to humans. Campylobacter spp., Salmonella, and Shigella spp. infections were not distributed equally among the age classes of gorillas: most of the enteropathogens (80%), and all Shigella spp. organisms, S. sonnei, S. boydii, and S. flexneri, were isolated from subadults and adult gorillas with ages ranging from 6.0 to 11.9 yr. The prevalence of Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. infections among human-habituated gorillas has doubled during the last 4 yr, and isolation of Shigella spp. for the first time from mountain gorillas, may indicate enhanced anthropozoonotic transmission of these enteropathogens."

Three females in two of four groups regularly use this behaviour. Other individuals in these groups or individuals of the two other groups in the same zoo do not use it. However, a very similar behaviour has been observed in three other individuals in a gorilla group of another zoo. The existence of this technique in spatially separated groups implies that multiple individuals have invented it for themselves. The possible role of social transmission is still to be investigated."

Before gazetting in 1992, MGNP had basically been agricultural land for well over 50 years. The distribution of exotic vegetation was established using a Geographical Positioning System receiver and indigenous vegetation was sampled by establishment of quadrats along transect lines.

Observations indicated that approximately 2% of the old cropland was covered by exotic woodlots. Black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) and Eucalyptus trees were found to be the most widely distributed and Pinus patula the least distributed species in the park. Species numbers of indigenous trees (n = 26) were high in the old cropland, compared with twelve species observed in exotic woodlots. The natural forest supported the highest (75%) stem density and the lowest (4%) stem density was recorded in exotic woodlots. Seedling class (< 2 cm, d.b.h.) accounted for the majority of juveniles, with the lowest stem density (1350 seedlings ha(-1)) recorded in exotic woodlots compared with 6609 seedlings ha(-1) in the old cropland and 24,625 seedlings ha(-1) in the natural forest. The levels of tree diversity and stocking characteristics recorded under the exotic species suggest that a low diverse community of native species may exploit this environment."

The density estimates were based on nest counts. The strip transect census and the line transect survey method (Standing Crop Nest Count) were used to estimate the gorilla nest group density. The strip transect has been most commonly used to date. It assumes that all nest groups within the width of the strip are detected, but as this assumption is easily violated in the dense tropical rain forest, the line transect survey was also used. In this method, only the nest groups on the transect line itself should be detected. This method proved to be an adequate and easy technique for estimating animal densities in dense vegetation. The gorilla density of 1.6 individuals km(-2) (line transect survey method) found for the Dzanga sector is one of the highest densities ever reported in the literature for the Western lowland gorilla. The density estimate for chimpanzees was 0.16 individuals km(-2) (census method). The results of this study confirm the importance of the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park for primate conservation."

It is here documented that area 10 also forms the frontal pole of chimpanzee, bonobo, orangutan, and gibbon brains. Imaging techniques and stereological tools are used to characterize this area across species and provide preliminary estimates of its absolute and relative size. Area 10 has similar cytoarchitectonic features in the hominoid brain, but aspects of its organization vary slightly across species, including the relative width of its cortical layers and the space available for connections. The cortex forming the frontal pole of the gorilla appears highly specialized, while area 10 in the gibbon occupies only the orbital sector of the frontal pole.

Area 10 in the human brain is larger relative to the rest of the brain than it is in the apes, and its supragranular layers have more space available for connections with other higher-order association areas. This suggests that the neural substrates supporting cognitive functions associated with this part of the cortex enlarged and became specialized during hominid evolution. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Corticotropin-releasing hormone-binding protein in primates,"['Bowman, ME', 'Lopata, A', 'Jaffe, RB', 'Golos, TG', 'Wickings, J', 'Smith, R']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/1098-2345(200103)53:3<123::AID-AJP3>3.0.CO;2-V,MAR 2001,26,"In humans, placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) production has been linked to the determination of gestational length, and a late gestational fall in CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP) has been linked to the onset of parturition. Expression of placental CRH mRNA is limited to primates, and only in man has a circulating CRH-BP been described. As the fall in CRH-BP in late gestation has been associated with parturition in humans, we sought to determine whether a CRH-BP circulated in the plasma of other primates. It is unclear whether maternal plasma CRH concentrations are elevated in New World monkeys and prosimians, We have therefore performed CRH plasma measurements in the blood of pregnant marmosets, in several species of lemur, and in pregnant and fetal rhesus monkeys as a positive control. Using gel chromatography, CRH-BP was detected in the human, gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon, macaque, squirrel monkey, and marmoset, but was absent in the mandrill, spider monkey, and lemur. CRH was detected in the plasma of pregnant marmosets and rhesus monkeys. CRH was also detected in the fetal rhesus monkey, but at lower concentrations than in maternal plasma. CRH immunoreactivity was not detectable in the plasma of pregnant lemurs or in extracts of lemur placenta. In conclusion, a circulating binding protein for CRH exists in all species of apes but occurs variably among New World and Old World monkeys and is absent in lemurs. The variable occurrence of the CRH-BP does not support a role for this protein in the mechanism of parturition in primates. Maternal CRH is elevated in the pregnant marmoset and rhesus, and may play a role in the pregnancy of New and Old World monkeys. (C) 2001 Wiley Liss, Inc."

PCR-amplified genomic se quences corresponding to the 11 exons were analyzed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing. Six nonsynonymous and 2 synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found to be common in-one ethnic group or another, and they involved codons 254 (Gly-GGC/Gly-GGT) in exon 3, 333 (Ile-ATC/Val-GTC) in exon 4, 370 (Ala-GCT/Val-GTT) in exon 5,- 458 (Val-GTG/Leu-TTG) in exon 6,518 (Val-GTC/Ile-ATC) in exon 7, 637 (Asp-GAC/Gly-GGC), 648 (Arg-CGA/Gln-CAA) and 661 (Pro-CCG/Pro-CCA) in exon 10. At each SNP site the sequence listed first was predominant.:in all ethnic groups. Several SNPs segregated on the same chromosome regardless of populations and species. Together, the SNPs produced 5 major human TAP1 alleles, 4 of which matched the officially recognized alleles *0101, *02011, *0301, and *0401; the 5th allele differed from each of those by at least 4 SNPs. Overall, TAP1*0101 was the predominant allele in all ethnic groups, with frequencies ranging from 0.667 in Zambians to 0.808 in US Caucasians. The TAP1*0401 frequency showed the greatest difference between Africans (0.221-0.254) and Caucasians (0.033), with Brazilians (0.058) fitting in the middle. Consistent with earlier work based on Caucasians and gorillas, *0101 appeared to be the newest human TAP1 allele, suggesting a dramatic spread of *0101 into all human populations examined. Characterization of TAP1 polymorphisms allowed the design of a PCR-based genotyping scheme that targeted 7 SNP sites and required 2 separate genotyping techniques.

Several nonhuman primates, including gorillas, develop signs of SpAs indistinguishable from clinical signs of humans with SpAs, To determine whether SpAs in gorillas have a similar HLA-B27-related etiology, we analyzed the MHC class I molecules expressed in four affected gorillas. Gogo-B01, isolated from three of the animals, has only limited similarity to HLA-B27 at the end of the al domain. It differs by several residues in the B pocket, including differences at positions 45 and 67, However, the molecular model of Gogo-B*0101 is consistent with a requirement for positively charged residues at the second amino acid of peptides bound by the MHC class I molecule. Indeed, the peptide binding motif and sequence of individual ligands eluted from Gogo-B*0101 demonstrate that, like HLA-B27, this gorilla MHC class I molecule binds peptides with arginine at the second amino acid position of peptides bound by the MHC class I molecule. Furthermore, live cell binding assays show that Gogo-B*0101 can bind HLA-B27 ligands, Therefore, although most gorillas that develop SpAs express an RMC class I molecule with striking differences to HLA-B27, this molecule binds peptides similar to those bound by HLA-B27."
Phylogenetic analysis of the friedreich ataxia GAA trinucleotide repeat,"['Justice, CM', 'Den, ZN', 'Nguyen, SV', 'Stoneking, M', 'Deininger, PL', 'Batzer, MA', 'Keats, BJB']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,NA,MAR 2001,17,"Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder associated with a GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of the gene (FRDA) encoding a novel, highly conserved, 210 amino acid protein known as frataxin. Normal variation in repeat size was determined by analysis of more than 600 DNA samples from seven human populations. This analysis showed that the most frequent allele had nine GAA repeats, and no alleles with fewer than five GAA repeats were found. The European and Syrian populations had the highest percentage of alleles with 10 or more GAA repeats, while the Papua New Guinea population did not have any alleles carrying more than 10 GAA repeats. The distributions of repeat sizes in the European, Syrian: and African American populations were significantly different from those in the Asian and Papua New Guinea populations (p < 0.001). The GAA repeat size was also determined in five nonhuman primates. Samples from 10 chimpanzees, 3 orangutans, 1 gorilla, 1 rhesus macaque, 1 mangabey, and 1 tamarin were analyzed. Among those primates belonging to the Pongidae family, the chimpanzees were found to carry three or four GAA repeats, the orangutans had four or five GAA repeats, and the gorilla carried three GAA repeats. In primates belonging to the Cercopithecidae family, three GAA repeats were found in the mangabey and two in the rhesus macaque. However, an AluY subfamily member inserted in the poly(A) tract preceding the GAA repeat region in the rhesus macaque, making the amplified sequence approximately 300 bp longer. The GAA repeat was also found in the tamarin, suggesting that it arose at least 40 million years ago and remained relatively small throughout the majority of primate evolution, with a punctuated expansion in the human genome."

Genomic divergences between humans and other hominoids and the effective population size of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees,"['Chen, FC', 'Li, WH']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS,10.1086/318206,FEB 2001,469,"To study the genomic divergences among hominoids and to estimate the effective population size of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees, we selected 53 autosomal intergenic nonrepetitive DNA segments from the human genome and sequenced them in a human, a chimpanzee, a gorilla, and an orangutan. The average sequence divergence was only 1.24% +/- 0.07% for the human-chimpanzee pair, 1.62% +/- 0.08% for the human-gorilla pair, and 1.63% +/- 0.08% for the chimpanzee-gorilla pair. These estimates, which were confirmed by additional data from GenBank, are substantially lower than previous ones, which included repetitive sequences and might have been based on less-accurate sequence data. The average sequence divergences between orangutans and humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas were 3.08% +/- 0.11%, 3.12% +/- 0.11%, and 3.09% +/- 0.11%, respectively, which also are substantially lower than previous estimates. The sequence divergences in other regions between hominoids were estimated from extensive data in GenBank and the literature, and Alus showed the highest divergence, followed in order by Y-linked noncoding regions, pseudogenes, autosomal intergenic regions, X-linked noncoding regions, synonymous sites, introns, and nonsynonymous sites. The neighbor-joining tree derived from the concatenated sequence of the 53 segments-24,234 bp in length-supports the Homo-Pan clade with a 100% bootstrap value. However, when each segment is analyzed separately, 22 of the 53 segments (similar to 42%) give a tree that is incongruent with the species tree, suggesting a large effective population size (Ne) of the common ancestor of Homo and Pan. Indeed, a parsimony analysis of the 53 segments and 37 protein-coding genes leads to an estimate of N-e = 52,000 to 96,000. As this estimate is 5 to 9 times larger than the long-term effective population size of humans (similar to 10,000) estimated from various genetic polymorphism data, the human lineage apparently had experienced a large reduction in effective population size after its separation from the chimpanzee lineage. Our analysis assumes a molecular clock, which is in fact supported by the sequence data used. Taking the orangutan speciation date as 12 to 16 million years ago, we obtain an estimate of 4.6 to 6.2 million years for the Homo-Pan divergence and an estimate of 6.2 to 8.4 million years for the gorilla speciation date, suggesting that the gorilla lineage branched off 1.6 to 2.2 million years earlier than did the human-chimpanzee divergence."
Attempts to detect retrotransposition and de novo deletion of Alus and other dispersed repeats at specific loci in the human genome,"['Hollies, CR', 'Monckton, DG', 'Jeffreys, AJ']",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS,10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200590,FEB 2001,9,"Dispersed repeat elements contribute to genome instability by de novo insertion and unequal recombination between repeats. To study the dynamics of these processes, we have developed single DNA molecule approaches to detect de novo insertions at a single locus and Alu-mediated deletions at two different loci in human genomic DNA. Validation experiments showed these approaches could detect insertions and deletions at frequencies below 10(-6) per cell. However, bulk analysis of germline (sperm) and somatic DNA showed no evidence for genuine mutant molecules, placing an upper limit of insertion and deletion rates of 2 x 10(-7) and 3 x 10(-7), respectively, in the individuals tested. Such re-arrangements at these loci therefore occur at a rate lower than that detectable by the most sensitive methods currently available."

We mapped the DGCR6 gene to chromosome 22q11 within a low copy repeat, termed sc11.1a, and identified a second copy of the gene, DGCR6L, within the duplicate locus, termed sc11.1b. Both sc11.1 repeats are deleted in most persons with velo-cardio-facial syndrome/DiGeorge syndrome (VCFS/DGS), and they map immediately adjacent and internal to the low copy repeats, termed LCR22, that mediate the deletions associated with VCFS/DGS. We sequenced genomic clones from both loci and determined that the putative initiator methionine is located further upstream than originally described, but in a position similar to the mouse and chicken orthologs. DGCR6L encodes a highly homologous, functional copy of DGCR6, with some base changes rendering amino acid differences. Expression studies of the two genes indicate that both genes are widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues. Evolutionary studies using FISH mapping in several different species of ape combined with sequence analysis of DGCR6 in a number of different primate species indicate that the duplication is at least 12 million years old and may date back to before the divergence of Catarrhines from Platyrrhines, 35 mya. These data suggest that there has been selective evolutionary pressure toward the Functional maintenance of both paralogs.

Comparison with control (uneaten) soils from the same areas showed lower levels of carbon and nitrogen in the eaten soils, a relationship confirmed by surface analysis. Surface analysis also revealed lower levels of iron on particle surfaces versus interiors. and higher levels of iron on ingested versus control soil particle surfaces. The soils can adsorb dietary toxins, present in the plant diet or those produced by microorganisms. Taking the toxic alkaloids quinine. atropine, sparteine, and lupanine as examples, it is evident that soils from Mahale have a very good adsorptive capacity. A new adaptive advantage of geophagy is proposed, based on the prevention of iron uptake. The behavior of the soils in vitro is consistent with the theory that geophagy has a therapeutic value for these chimpanzees."
Factors influencing the formation of ground nests by eastern lowland gorillas in Kahuzi-Biega National Park: some evolutionary implications of nesting behavior,"['Yamagiwa, J']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.2000.0444,FEB 2001,21,"To analyze the factors influencing nesting by gorillas on the ground, three kinds of data were collected in the Kahuzi-Biega National Park: from a single group for 3 years, from 25 groups during a population census, and from a habituated group before and after two social events. The data on the proportion of ground nests built by the single group for 3 years show no significant differences between rainy and dry seasons. Significant differences were found between some vegetation types: in particular, between bamboo forest and others (primary and secondary forests). However, these differences were not prominent or consistent across age-sex classes of gorillas. By contrast, large differences were found in this proportion between adults and immatures in both primary and secondary forests. The low proportion of ground nests built by immatures indicates their vulnerability. The present study suggests that the proportion was not influenced by group size but strongly influenced by the presence or absence of a leading silverback. Data on a habituated group that lost its leading male and acquired a new male after several months clearly show that females and immatures preferred sleeping in trees in the absence of a protector male. Immatures drastically decreased terrestrial nesting (from 54% to 6%, P<0.001) and increased it (from 6% to 19%, P>0.05) less dramatically than females did (from 24% to 60%, P<0.01) after immigration of the new male. These results suggest that vulnerability of female and immature gorillas to predators, in spite of their large body size. Small body size and considerable sexual dimorphism in early hominids implies their frequent use of tree nests and the importance of the male's role as protector. (C) 2001 Academic Press."

Therefore, to address the question of the origin of humans from a genetic point of view, evolutionary histories from many genetic loci have to be gathered and compared. We have studied two genes residing on the X chromosome encoding monoamine oxidases A and B (MAOA and MAOB). Both genes have been suggested to play a role in psychiatric and/or behavioral traits. To search for DNA variants of the MAO genes, the sequences of exonic and flanking intronic regions of these two genes were determined in a group of Swedish males. The sequence analysis revealed several novel polymorphisms in the MAO genes. Haplotypes containing high-frequency MAOA polymorphisms were constructed, and their Frequencies were determined in additional samples from Caucasian, Asian, and African populations. We found two common haplotypes with similar frequencies in Caucasian and Asian populations. However, only one of them was also the most frequent haplotype in Africans, while the other haplotype was present in only one Kenyan male. This profound change in haplotype frequencies from Africans to non-Africans supports a possible bottleneck during the dispersion of modern humans from Africa."
Global patterns of human DNA sequence variation in a 10-kb region on chromosome 1,"['Yu, N', 'Fu, YX', 'Sambuughin, N', 'Ramsay, M', 'Jenkins, T', 'Leskinen, E', 'Patthy, L', 'Jorde, LB', 'Kuromori, T', 'Li, WH']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,FEB 2001,100,"Human DNA variation is currently a subject of intense research because of its importance for studying human origins, evolution, and demographic history and for association studies of complex diseases. A similar to 10-kb region on chromosome 1, which contains only four small exons (each <155 bp), was sequenced for 61 humans (20 Africans, 20 Asians, and 21 Europeans) and for 1 chimpanzee, 1 gorilla, and 1 orangutan. We found 52 polymorphic sites among the 122 human sequences and 382 variant sites among the human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan sequences. For the introns sequenced (8,991 bp), the nucleotide diversity (<pi>) was 0.058% among all sequences, 0.076% among the African sequences, 0.047% among the Asian sequences, and 0.045% among the European sequences. A compilation of data revealed that autosomal regions have, on average, the highest rr value (0.091%), X-linked regions have a somewhat lower pi value (0.079%), and Y-linked regions have a very low pi value (0.008%). The lower polymorphism in the present region may be due to a lower mutation rate and/or selection in the gene containing these introns or in genes linked to this region. The present region and two other 10-kb noncoding regions all show a strong excess of low-frequency variants, indicating a relatively recent population expansion. This region has a low mutation rate, which was estimated to be 0.74 x 10(-9) per nucleotide per year. An average estimate of similar to 12,600 for the long-term effective population size was obtained using various methods; the estimate was not far from the commonly used value of 10,000. Fu and Li's tests rejected the assumption of an equilibrium neutral Wright-Fisher population, largely owing to the high proportion of low-frequency variants. The age of the most recent common ancestor of the sequences in our sample was estimated to be more than 1 Myr. Allowing for some unrealistic assumptions in the model, this estimate would still suggest an age of more than 500,000 years, providing further evidence for a genetic history of humans much more ancient than the emergence of modern humans. The fact that many unique variants exist in Europe and Asia also suggests a fairly long genetic history outside of Africa and argues against a complete replacement of all indigenous populations in Europe and Asia by a small Africa stock. Moreover, the ancient genetic history of humans indicates no severe bottleneck during the evolution of humans in the last half million years; otherwise, much of the ancient genetic history would have been lost during a severe bottleneck. We suggest that both the ""Out of Africa"" and the multiregional models are too simple to explain the evolution of modern humans."

In the present study of three species of Hominoid primates, the procrustes superimposition reveals that various heterochronic processes are simultaneously present. Size-age-shape dissociations between species, already present in the first ontogenetic stage, are amplified with growth until adult stage.

To overcome this problem, the recently developed multicolor banding (MCB) probe set for all human chromosomes was applied in the present study to reanalyze the chromosomes of Gorilla gorilla (GGO). While the results agree with those of most previous banding and FISH studies, the breakpoints for the pericentric inversion on GGO 3 were defined more precisely.

Rapid detection of the ERV-K(C4) retroviral insertion reveals further structural polymorphism of the complement C4 genes in old world primates,"['Schneider, PM', 'Witzel-Schlomp, K', 'Steinhauer, C', 'Stradmann-Bellinghausen, B', 'Rittner, C']",EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1159/000049192,2001,5,"The fourth component of complement (C4) is coded for by two tandem-duplicated genes located in the class III region of the MHC of humans as well as a number of primates. A C4 gene size polymorphism giving rise to two gene variants of 16 and 22.3 kb length can be attributed to a complete endogenous retroviral insertion of 6.3 kb termed ERV-K(C4) in intron 9 of the long C4 genes. We developed a simple PCR-based screening assay to detect the presence of this insertion, and tested a number of unrelated animals from old world primate species. The presence of the ERV insertion in the orangutan, rhesus macaque and green monkey as well as its absence in gorillas and chimpanzees could be confirmed. In addition, the insertion was also detected in the baboon and the cynomolgus macaque whereas it was not found in a single gibbon. Among rhesus and cynomolgus macaques one individual was identified in each species only carrying short C4 genes demonstrating further structural heterogeneity in these species. Based on these findings we propose that the primigenial retroviral integration occurred prior to the radiation of old world primate species, and that both the long and the short forms of the C4 gene have existed side by side since then.

Large-scale genotyping of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla DNAs revealed the homozygous presence of the phi hHaA nonsense mutation in humans of different ethnic backgrounds, but its absence in the functional orthologous chimpanzee (cHaA) and gorilla (gHaA) genes. Expression analyses of the encoded cHaA and gHaA hair keratins served to highlight dramatic differences between the hair keratin phenotypes of contemporary humans and the great apes. The relative numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions in the phi hHaA and cHaA genes, as inferred by using the gHaA gene as an outgroup, suggest that the human hHaA gene was inactivated only recently, viz., less than 240,000 years ago. This implies that the hair keratin phenotype of hominids prior to this date, and after the Pan-Homo divergence some 5.5 million years ago, could have been identical to that of the great apes. In addition, the homozygous presence of the phi hHaA exon 4 nonsense mutation in some of the earliest branching lineages among extant human populations lends strong support to the ""single African origin"" hypothesis of modern humans."

A data set that combined in a tandem alignment these two sets of noncoding DNA orthologues ham the two unlinked nuclear genomic loci yielded the following confirmatory results both on the course of cladistic branchings (the divisions in a cladistic classification of higher ranking taxa into subordinate taxa) and on the ages of the taxa teach taxon representing a clade). The cercopithecid branch of catarrhines, at similar to 14 Ma (mega annum) divided into Colobini (the leaf-eating Old World monkeys) and Cercopithecini (the cheek-pouched Old World monkeys). At similar to 10-9 Ma, Colobini divided into an African clade, Colobina, and an Asian clade, Presbytina; similarly at this time level, Cercopithecini divided into Cercopithecina (the guenons, patas, and green monkeys) and Papionina. At similar to7 Ma, Papionina divided into Macaca, Cercocebus, and Papio. At similar to5 Ma, Cercocebus divided subgenerically into C: (Cercocebus) for terrestrial mangabeys and C.

In turn, the hominid branch of catarrhines at similar to 18 Ma divided into Hylobatini (gibbons and siamangs) and Hominini; at similar to 14 Ma, Hominini divided into Pongina (orangutans) and Hominina; at similar to7 Ma, Hominina divided into Gorilla and Homo; and at similar to6-5 Ma, Homo divided subgenerically into H.

Results obtained with this data set revealed a faster rate of nuclieotide substitutions in the early primate lineage to the anthropoid (platyrrhine/catarrhine) ancestor than from that ancestor to the present. Rates were slower in catarrhines than in platyrrhines, slower in the cheek-pouched than in the leaf-eating cercopithecids, and slower yet in the hominids, On relating these results to data on brain sizes and life spans, it was suggested that life-history strategies that favor intelligence and longer life spans also select for decreases in de novo mutation rates.

Comparative expression of hedonic impact: affective reactions to taste by human infants and other primates,"['Steiner, JE', 'Glaser, D', 'Hawilo, ME', 'Berridge, KC']",NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS,10.1016/S0149-7634(00)00051-8,JAN 2001,247,"This study examines behavioral affective reactions elicited by tastes from eight newborn human infants, and from 27 other infant or adult primates. Non-human primates belonged to 11 species: three great apes (chimpanzee, orangutan, gorilla), three Old World monkeys (rhesus monkey, greater spot-nosed monkey, and red-capped mangabey), four New World monkeys (golden-handed tamarin, cotton-top tamarin, white tufted-ear marmoset, and Humboldt's night monkey), and one lemur (mongoose lemur). The taste of sucrose elicited homologous positive hedonic patterns of facial affective reactions from humans and other primates, whereas quinine elicited homologous aversive or negative affective patterns. The degree of similarity between human and other primate affective reaction patterns appeared to be strongly indicative of their phylogenetic relatedness. For example, affective reaction patterns of human infants and great apes were more similar to each other than either were to Old World monkeys or New World monkeys. Certain affective reaction components were found to be shared by humans and all primates, whereas other components were restricted to particular taxonomic groups. Finally, allometric timing parameters for the: duration of components: indicated that the 'same' affective reaction could have different durations in species of different size. These results show that both positive/negative valence and intensity of affective reaction may be quantitatively assessed in human and non-human primates, and indicate that taste-elicited affective reaction patterns of human infants are related systematically to those of other primate species.

Previous estimates made in the early 1990s indicated that the population numbered around 300 individuals. The census reported here was the first in Bwindi to use the method successfully developed in the Virungas, which utilizes a complete sweep across the park within a short period of time by a large number of teams working simultaneously. We estimated the population to be 292 individuals; to the best of our understanding - based on previous estimates - the population, therefore, appears to be stable. Most gorillas were found within the centre of the southern section of the park. It appears that there are some areas of unused habitat and, therefore, room for the population to grow. We found no clear relationship between gorilla distribution and human presence, but some forms of disturbance were moro frequent and close to the edge of the park and may contribute to the gorillas' avoidance of these areas. The effects of human disturbance, including tourism, on the gorillas and other wildlife should be investigated in more detail and monitored over time. This is particularly important in multiple-use zones which have been established around the edges of the park for bee-keeping, collection of non-timber forest products, and tourism."

Aggression by resident males against the strangers decreased but the former remained intolerant. The strange males appeared at a time when the number of adult resident males was lower as in the years before and when the adult sex ratio (number of adult females per male) was higher as in the years before. Using definitions from studies on dispersal patterns of male gorillas (HARCOURT, 1978) and female bonobos (FURUICHI, 1989) the spatial association between the two strange males acid residents could be described as male transfer."
Saving the gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan t. troglodytes) of the Congo Basin,"['Tutin, CEG']",REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT,10.1071/RD01092,2001,8,"The forests of the Congo Basin in equatorial Africa are home to significant populations of gorillas and chimpanzees. However, numbers are declining owing to hunting and to alteration of their habitat. Gorillas and chimpanzees are particularly vulnerable for biological reasons: slow reproduction, prolonged developmental periods and complex social behaviour. In addition, their capacity to recover from disturbance is limited and the reinforcement of wild populations with captive-born individuals is rarely an option. Compared with the critically endangered mountain gorillas and the beleaguered chimpanzees in forest fragments in West Africa, there are some reasons for optimism about the future of the Congo Basin apes: levels of threat remain relatively low; and conservation of tropical rainforests has become a priority of the international community. At the same time, knowledge of the ecological needs of wild apes has increased and non-invasive techniques now exist to monitor population health. Sadly, no animals remain truly 'wild', as their survival depends to a greater or lesser extent on management. Protected areas and laws that forbid hunting of vulnerable species are classic tools of management, but broader landscape visions are now emerging that may allow the Congo Basin to avoid the fragile scenario of larger animals persisting only in 'island' parks."
Origin of human bipedalism: The knuckle-walking hypothesis revisited,"['Richmond, BG', 'Begun, DR', 'Strait, DS', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']","YEARBOOK OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY, VOL 44",10.1002/ajpa.10019,2001,93,"Some of the most long-standing questions in paleoanthropology concern how and why human bipedalism evolved. Over the last century, many hypotheses have been offered on the mode of locomotion from which bipedalism originated. Candidate ancestral adaptations include monkey-like arboreal or terrestrial quadrupedalism, gibbon- or orangutan-like (or other forms of) climbing and suspension, and knuckle-walking. This paper reviews the history of these hypotheses, outlines their predictions, and assesses them in light of current phylogenetic, comparative anatomical, and fossil evidence. The functional significance of characteristics of the shoulder and arm, elbow, wrist, and hand shared by African apes and humans, including their fossil relatives, most strongly supports the knuckle-walking hypothesis, which reconstructs the ancestor as being adapted to knuckle-walking and arboreal climbing. Future fossil discoveries, and a clear understanding of anthropoid locomotor anatomy, are required to ultimately test these hypotheses. If knuckle-walking was an important component of the behavioral repertoire of the prebipedal human ancestor, then we can reject scenarios on the origin of bipedalism that rely on a strictly arboreal ancestor. Moreover, paleoenvironmental data associated with the earliest hominins, and their close relatives, contradict hypotheses that place the agents of selection for bipedality in open savanna habitats. Existing hypotheses must explain why bipedalism would evolve from an ancestor that was already partly terrestrial. Many food acquisition and carrying hypotheses remain tenable in light of current evidence, Yrbk Phys Anthropol 44:70-105, 2001. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc,"
A preliminary behavioral comparison of two captive all-male gorilla groups,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Hoff, MP', 'Lukas, KE', 'Maple, TL']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.1003,2001,14,"Gorillas live in polygamous harem groups, generally composed of one male, several adult females, and their offspring. With an equal numbers of male and female gorillas born in captivity, however, housing gorillas in social breeding units inevitably means that some males will not have access to female social partners. Thus, the future of the captive gorilla population depends on the collective ability of toes to house equal numbers of males and females. This study examined the behavioral profiles of two all-male groups of captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) to provide information on this type of housing situation. One group consisted of three subadult individuals, while the other consisted of two subadults and a silverback. Data were collected during two 6-month intervals, for a total of 284 hr. The behavioral profiles of the animals were stable over the course of the study but proximity patterns changed. Differences in feeding, solitary play, and object-directed behavior were found between groups, while no significant differences were observed in affiliative or agonistic social behavior. At both institutions, group cohesion appeared to be high, particularly between subadults; these individuals spent approximately 10% of their time engaging in social behavior and 25-50% of their time in close proximity (within 5 m). However, the Zoo Atlanta males spent significantly more time within 1 m and 5 m of each other than the Santa Barbara males, which may reflect a higher level of cohesiveness among members of the Zoo Atlanta group. The behavioral profiles of the animals in this study were similar to those found in bachelor groups of wild mountain gorillas. One notable exception was the absence of homosexual behavior between the silverback and subadults in Santa Barbara and the low frequency of this behavior between subadults in both groups. Although more longitudinal data are needed, these data suggest that all-male groups can be a feasible housing strategy for males at certain periods of their life span. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

The resulting two-dimensional representations clearly show that in samples taken during this 2.5-year period, the silverback male was surrounded by five adult females, while three infant or young juvenile females, gathered in a body, remained between the silverback male and adult females. Some adult females maintained proximity to the silverback male more frequently than other adult females throughout the five periods. Unlike mountain gorillas in the wild, females with dependent offspring did not tend to stay near the silverback male more frequently than other females, and related females did not tend to spend more time near each other than non-related females. Three older juvenile or young adult males were plotted the furthest from the silverback male, with gradual changes with increasing age. The usefulness of the MDS procedure, which can be used to visualize easily and clearly the social relationships among individuals, is discussed from the viewpoint of the management of breeding groups of captive gorillas.

Managing the socialization of an adult male gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) with a history of social deprivation,"['Burks, KD', 'Bloomsmith, MA', 'Forthman, DL', 'Maple, TL']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.1033,2001,7,"Most non-human primates exhibit aggression during changes in social group composition. In zoological parks, group membership changes are necessary for optimal population management, but can elicit problematic aggression. Furthermore, some primates with a long history of social deprivation are hyperaggressive when introduced to conspecifics. In this study of one male gorilla with a 30-year history of social deprivation, we assessed the rate of aggression quantitatively during a four-step socialization procedure. We hypothesized that 1) the frequency of agonistic/display behaviors would increase markedly at the beginning of each phase of the socialization, then decline to baseline levels over time in each phase and 2) the frequency of affiliative behaviors would not vary systematically within or between phases of socialization. Our results largely supported these predictions, and we found the four-step socialization process effective in managing aggression in this case. In addition to documenting the successful socialization of a socially deprived adult male gorilla, we believe that the empirical process used in this case argues for scientific management of other introductions.

We report here a system for the easy isolation of markers from a wide range of LINE-1 elements and the screening of recently transposed elements from that population. This is accomplished by the use of PCR with degenerate primers specific for conserved regions of the reverse transcriptase gene, a modified screening vector and a refined blue/white colony assay that screens for amplified DNA containing open reading frames This method should be applicable to searches for endogenous retroviruses."

It contains over half the world's mountain gorillas. It is surrounded by densely populated agricultural land and lies within a region of political instability. Gazetted as a forest reserve in 1932, little forest now remains outside its boundaries. Transformation of nearby communal swampland to farmland, much owned by a few individuals, shows the probable fate of Bwindi if it had not been declared a protected area. widespread illegal logging and other activities were among reasons why the status of the forest was raised to national park in 1991. This resulted in local resentment, fed by inadequate consultation and concern about the local people's loss of access to resources. Fires were set in the forest and threats made against the gorillas. Three schemes to provide benefits from the existence of the forest to communities and involve them in park management were then instituted: agreements allowing controlled harvesting of resources in the park, receipt of some revenue from tourism, and establishment of a trust fund partly for community development Tension between people and park has been reduced. This case demonstrates the importance of protected areas and community involvement in such circumstances. Community support is especially critical, as here, when resources available to park managers are limited and political instability endemic."

We previously proposed a molecular model of human DAF's four CCPs in which certain amino acids were postulated to be recognition sites for the interaction between DAF and the C3 convertases. In the current study, wt characterized DAF in five non-human primates: the great apes, gorilla and common chimpanzee, and the Old World monkeys: hamadryas baboon, Rhesus macaque, and patas monkey. Amino acid homology to human DAF was approximately 98% for the two great apes and 83% for the three Old World monkeys. The above cited putative ligand interactive residues were found to be fully conserved in all of the non-human primates, although there were amino acid changes outside of these areas, In the chimpanzee, alternative splicing of the S/T region was Found potentially to be the source of multiple protein isoforms in erythrocytes, whereas in the patas monkey, similar alternative splicing was observed but only one protein band was seen. Interestingly, a Rhesus macaque was found to exhibit a phenomenon paralleling the human Cromer Dr(a-) blood group, in which a 44-base pair deletion in CCP3 leads to a frameshift and early STOP codon.

Nine, sixteen, eight, and fourteen pepsinogens were purified or partially purified from the gastric mucosa of a gibbon, orang-utan, gorilla, and chimpanzee, respectively. Most of these were type-A pepsinogens, and only one type-C pepsinogen was identified in each ape. The two types could be readily distinguished by staining for proteolytic activity on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in the presence/absence of pepstatin. Type-A pepsinogens were further divided into two subtypes. One subtype, constituting a major group of pepsinogens in apes, exhibited high hemoglobin-digestive activity. The other subtype was specified by a relatively high content of Lys and low hemoglobin-digestive activity. It is likely that pepsinogen-A genes have been duplicated several times as hominoids, including humans, evolved in the primate lineage. The presence of multiple pepsinogens in apes might be advantageous in the efficient digestion of a wide variety of foods."

Using a degenerate consensus primer PCR method for the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene, the presence of KSHV homologues has been investigated in two semi-free-ranging colonies of eight drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus), five mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx), and two hybrid (Mandrillus leucophaeus-Mandrillus sphinx) monkeys, living in Cameroon and Gabon, Central Africa. This search revealed the existence of not only two distinct KSHV homologues, each one belonging to one of the two rhadinovirus genogroups, but also of two new betaherpesvirus sequences, one being close to cytomegaloviruses and the other being related to human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and -7). The latter viruses are the first simian HHV-6 and -7 homologues identified to date. These data show that mandrill and drill monkeys are the hosts of at least four novel distinct herpesviruses. Moreover, mandrills, like macaques and African green monkeys, harbor also two distinct gamma-2 herpesviruses, thus strongly suggesting that a second gamma-2 herpesvirus, belonging to the RV2 genogroup, may exist in humans."

Management of reactive arthritis in a juvenile gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) with long-term sulfasalazine therapy,"['Neiffer, DL', 'Rothschild, BM', 'Marks, SK', 'Urvater, JA', 'Watkins, DI']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,DEC 2000,9,"A juvenile western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) experienced recurrent fever, lethargy, diarrhea, and/or arthritis starting at age 6 mo. During an episode at age 15 mo, Shigella sp. was isolated from diarrheic feces. At age 41 mo, reactive arthritis was diagnosed. In addition, the gorilla's growth was retarded. All arthritic attacks were managed symptomatically prior to age 4 yr, at which time a severe episode precipitated the implementation of therapy with sulfasalazine, an arthritis suppressive medication. Examination 27 mo later revealed cessation of progressive joint pathology although the animal exhibited decreased range of motion in most joints. The gorilla has been on sulfasalazine therapy for 4 yr without lameness. Growth has resumed, and there has been no radiographic evidence of progressive joint degeneration. Immunogenetic analysis of whole blood obtained at age 68 mo identified the gorilla major histocompatibility class I allele, Gogo-B*0101, which has limited nucleotide sequence similarity to HLA-B27, an allele associated with postinfection reactive arthritis in humans. Sulfasalazine therapy effectively managed reactive arthritis in this gorilla and should be considered for similarly frequently affected animals. Juvenile gorillas, in populations with a history of clinical shigellosis and/or postdiarrhea arthritis, may benefit from prophylactic sulfasalazine therapy after episodes of bacterial enterocolitis. Sulfasalazine therapy should be considered in all gorillas, juvenile and adult, experiencing confirmed Shigella sp.-associated enterocolitis."

The five exons of the gene were sequenced in three gorillas and in a normally pigmented human. The tyrosinase gene has been found to he a very conserved locus with a very low substitution rate. Some nucleotide and amino acid differences were found between the gorilla and human tyrosinase coding sequences. One of the gorillas included in the study is the only known case of albinism in a gorilla ('Snowflake'). Mutations of the TYR gene lead to Oculocutaneous Albinism type 1 (OCA1), the most common type of albinism in humans (OMIM accession number 203100), The TYR gene encodes the tyrosinase enzyme (E.C. 1.14.18.1), whose activity was found to be completely lacking in 'Snowflake', indicating that a mutation in the Tyr gene is the likely cause of his albinism, Nonetheless, no nucleotide changes were detected that could account for the lack of Tyr product or tyrosinase activity in Snowflake, and explanations of these findings are discussed."

Overfiling: Policy arguments in support of the gorilla in the closet,"['Dittman, L']",UCLA LAW REVIEW,NA,DEC 2000,3,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) often delegates the authority to enforce federal environmental statutes to the states. However, the EPA retains some enforcement authority, occasionally going so far as to bring its own independent action against an environmental violator in a process called overfiling. In this Comment, Lisa Dittman argues that overfiling, despite its drawbacks, serves important policy objectives. Focusing on the Eighth Circuit's decision in Harmon Industries, Inc. v. Browner, she begins by examining the arguments for and against overfiling as presented by the EPA and the Eighth Circuit. Next, she addresses the policy implications of disallowing overfiling and argues that these considerations should preclude the judicial application of res judicata to overfiling. Dittman concludes that overfiling is an important intermediate enforcement tool needed by the EPA to maintain federal primacy and national consistency in the enforcement of federal environmental laws."

The human MHC-G transcript is differentially spliced, giving rise to at lease six different forms. Tn order to study the evolutionary importance of this phenomenon, the presence of alternative splicing in MHC-G mRNA molecules from Pongidae (Chimpanzee, Gorilla, and Orangutan) has been investigated in the present work, and three alternative spliced isoforms (i.e.: G1, G2, and G3) have been found, but not the G4 and the soluble G5 and Gb ones. In addition, a novel MHC-G isoform is de scribed in Gorilla, ""G2 short."" This molecule is similar to the G2 isoform, but it lacks 29 amino acids normally encoded by exon 4. Our findings suggest that soluble isoforms are not necessary for MI-IC-G function(s) in Pongidae or that MHC-G is not a functional protein, because G1 is not necessary for survival in humans and Cercopithecinae bear stop codons in MHC-G exon 3.

Integrated analysis of sequence evolution and population history using hypervariable compound haplotypes,"['Rogers, EJ', 'Shone, AC', 'Alonso, S', 'May, CA', 'Armour, JAL']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/9.18.2675,NOV 1 2000,11,"We have examined compound haplotypes from a highly informative region of human chromosome 16, in which information from the rapid evolution of a highly unstable minisatellite is integrated with data on the longer-term evolution of this segment from 10 flanking substitutional polymorphisms, Combined with sequence data from non-human primates, analysis of relationships between these compound haplotypes allows the reconstruction of a rooted network of the evolutionary pathways between them, Most relationships can be explained via simple substitutional mutations, although the origins of some haplotypes involve recurrent events at a hotspot for substitutional mutation and/or gene conversion. For compound haplotypes including the minisatellite array, the network found in a range of world-wide populations constitutes a highly informative data set for the analysis of population history (437 different compound haplotypes were discriminated among 658 studied). Since the mutation rates and processes of the minisatellite array are known from direct studies, ages for individual lineages have been estimated using associated minisatellite diversity, These analyses suggest that the higher information content and sampling depth of these compound haplotypes may allow more precise calibration of lineage ages than is possible using coalescent analysis of DNA sequence. Using this method we have dated the oldest Eurasian lineage as 52 000-66 000 years and the oldest European specific lineage as 37 600-56 200 years."
Effects of environmental change on emerging parasitic diseases,"['Patz, JA', 'Graczyk, TK', 'Geller, N', 'Vittor, AY']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/S0020-7519(00)00141-7,NOV 2000,357,"Ecological disturbances exert an influence on the emergence and proliferation of malaria and zoonotic parasitic diseases, including, Leishmaniasis, cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, trypanosomiasis, schistosomiasis, filariasis, onchocerciasis, and loiasis. Each environmental change, whether occurring as a natural phenomenon or through human intervention, changes the ecological balance and context within which disease hosts or vectors and parasites breed, develop, and transmit disease. Each species occupies a particular ecological niche and vector species sub-populations are distinct behaviourally and genetically as they adapt to man-made environments. Most zoonotic parasites display three distinct life cycles: sylvatic, zoonotic, and anthroponotic. In adapting to changed environmental conditions, including reduced non human population and increased human population, some vectors display conversion from a primarily zoophyllic to primarily anthrophyllic orientation. Deforestation and ensuing changes in landuse, human settlement, commercial development, road construction, water control systems (dams, canals, irrigation systems, reservoirs), and climate, singly, and in combination have been accompanied by global increases in morbidity and mortality from emergent parasitic disease. The replacement of forests with crop farming, ranching, and raising small animals can create supportive habitats for parasites and their host vectors. When the landuse of deforested areas changes, the pattern of human settlement is altered and habitat fragmentation may provide opportunities for exchange and transmission of parasites to the heretofore uninfected humans. Construction of water control projects can lead to shifts in such vector populations as snails and mosquitoes and their parasites. Construction of roads in previously inaccessible forested areas can lead to erosion, and stagnant ponds by blocking the Row of streams when the water rises during the rainy season. The combined effects of environmentally detrimental changes in local landuse and alterations in global climate disrupt the natural ecosystem and can increase the risk of transmission of parasitic diseases to the human population.

Evolution of the X-linked zinc finger gene and the Y-linked zinc finger gene in primates,"['Kim, HS', 'Takenaka, O']",MOLECULES AND CELLS,NA,OCT 31 2000,3,"We have sequenced the partial exon of the zinc finger genes (ZFX and ZFY) in 5 hominoids, 2 Old World monkeys, 1 New World monkey, and 1 prosimian, Among these primate species, the percentage similarities of the nucleotide sequence of the ZFX gene were 96-100% and 91.2-99.7% for the ZFY gene, Of 397 sites in the ZFX and ZFY gene sequences, 20 for ZFX gene and 42 for ZFY gene were found to be variable. Substitution causes 1 amino acid change in ZFX, and 5 in ZFY, among 132 amino acids. The numbers of synonymous substitutions per site (Ks) between human and the chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan for ZFY gene were 0.026, 0.033, and 0.085, respectively. In contrast, the Iis value between human and hominoid primates for the ZFX gene was 0.008 for each comparison. Comparison of the ZFX and ZFY genes revealed that the synonymous substitution levels were higher in hominoids than in other primates, The rates of synonymous substitution per site per year were higher in the ZFY exon than in the SRY exon, and higher in the ZFY exon than in the ZFY intron, in hominoid primates."
Adaptations in reproduction and behaviour of captive pongids - zoobiological and veterinary management,"['Boer, M']",DEUTSCHE TIERARZTLICHE WOCHENSCHRIFT,NA,OCT 2000,0,"Monitoring of renal LH-excretion, changes in genital tumescence and menses assesses reproductive status in zookept female chimpanzees. Temporary detumescence of female sex skin in estrus is a reliable indicator for stress. Assessment of female chimpanzee reproductive status relates to local and individual variation of cycle length and temporal correlation of investigated parameters. Monitoring of neonate chimpanzee behavioural ontogeny is an essential tool of evaluating applied rearing methods since individuals were to be integrated into the adult group during adolescence. Slow and continuous transition periods between consecutive rearing phases avoid irreversible disturbed behaviour. Care by one person up to the age of 12 months, followed by a 3 year stay in a peer group guarantee normal development in zookept infant chimpanzees. 4-5 years old chimpanzees with infantile attributes and abilities to submit and appease can be integrated to adults with low risk. In female gorillas sexual cyclicity was monitored by renal excretion of LH, length of menses, sexual behaviour and - in tame females - by basal body temperature and variation of length of the urogenital cleft. Intraspecific variation of cyclicity allowed individual fertility assessment after comparison of several cycles. Analyses of behaviour gave hints to overcharged adaptability and reduced infertility under inadequate maintenance. Data on semen and testicular biopsy improve fertility-evaluation in gorilla males and point to degree and time of tissue alteration and etiology. Body hygiene analogous to the human, tool use and interspecific play with chimpanzees and humans behind window screens were observed in inadequately kept gorillas. Homosexual behaviour among females was reversible with environmental and social changes. Coalitions among nonrelated females were-an effective social strategy against an aggressive male. Cyclicity was disturbed drastically by social events such as physical lesions made by a male but normalized with improved social situation. Disturbed cyclicity featured prolongation of interestrus intervals and complete detumescence, oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea. Nulliparous females in their third decennium needed more than 1,5 years of social contact to a fertile male to become fullterm pregnant. During the first two months of pregnancy stillbirths and embryonic resorptions were detected. Hand-reared and inexperienced primiparous gorilla females accepted their infants and reared them normally after witnessing motherrearing in neighbored chimpanzee females for several years. Opportunities of free choice and decision making determine zookept pongid behaviour, that cannot be compared with prisoners' ethology. Adaptations of ontogenetic behaviour and reproduction, teleonomic patterns and zoomorphism are of zoobiological relevance. Adaptations develope during prolonged periods of time and thus results of corresponding management issues are to be assessed a posteriori."
The implications of intergenic polymorphism for major histocompatibility complex evolution,"[""O'hUigin, C"", 'Satta, Y', 'Hausmann, A', 'Dawkins, RL', 'Klein, J']",GENETICS,NA,OCT 2000,21,"A systematic survey of six intergenic regions flanking the human HLA-B locus in eight haplotypes reveals the regions to be up to 20 times more polymorphic than the reported average degree of human neutral polymorphism. Furthermore, the extent of polymorphism is directly related to the proximity to the HLA-B locus. Apparently linkage to HLA-B locus alleles, which are under balancing selection, maintains the neutral polymorphism of adjacent regions. For these linked polymorphisms to persist, recombination in the 200-kb interval from HLA-B to TNF must occur at a low frequency. The high degree of polymorphism found distal to HLA-B suggests that recombination is uncommon on both sides of the HLA-B locus. The least-squares estimate is 0.15% per megabase with an estimated range from 0.02 to 0.54%. These findings place strong restrictions on possible recombinational mechanisms for the generation of diversity at the HLA-B."
Cytochrome c oxidase assembly in primates is sensitive to small evolutionary variations in amino acid sequence,"['Barrientos, A', 'Muller, S', 'Dey, R', 'Wienberg, J', 'Moraes, CT']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,OCT 2000,36,"Respiring mitochondria require many interactions between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from the gorilla and the chimpanzee are able to restore oxidative phosphorylation in a human cell, mtDNAs from more distant primate species are functionally incompatible with human nuclear genes. Using microcell-mediated chromosome and mitochondria transfer, we introduced and maintained a functional orangutan mtDNA in a human nuclear background. However, partial oxidative phosphorylation function was restored only in the presence of most orangutan chromosomes, suggesting that human oxidative phosphorylation-related nuclear-coded genes are not able to replace many orangutan ones. The respiratory capacity of these hybrids was decreased by 65%-80%, and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity was decreased by 85%-95%. The function of other respiratory complexes was not significantly altered. The translation of mtDNA-coded COX subunits was normal, but their steady-state levels were similar to 10% of normal ones. Nuclear-coded COX subunits were loosely associated with mitochondrial membranes, a characteristic of COX assembly-defective mutants. Our results suggest that many human nuclear-coded genes not only cannot replace the orangutan counterparts, but also exert a specific interference at the level of COX assembly. This cellular model underscores the precision of COX assembly in mammals and sheds light on the nature of nuclear-mtDNA coevolutionary constraints."

Progressive inactivation of the haploid expressed gene for the sperm-specific endozepine-like peptide (ELP) through primate evolution,"['Ivell, R', 'Pusch, W', 'Balvers, M', 'Valentin, M', 'Walther, N', 'Weinbauer, G']",GENE,10.1016/S0378-1119(00)00317-6,SEP 19 2000,9,"The endozepine-like peptide (ELP) is a novel intracellular molecule which is expressed in high amounts at both mRNA and protein levels very specifically in late haploid male germ cells. It is closely related to the ubiquitous acyl-CoA binding protein, is highly conserved, shares a similar ability to bind mid-long chain acyl-CoA, and is thus likely to be involved in mature sperm metabolism While it has been characterized from diverse mammals, it has so far not been possible to identify an equivalent molecule in the primate testis. Using a PCR approach, combined with cDNA cloning and Northern hybridization, testicular transcripts and/or genomic DNA were analysed for different primate species, including human. In the marmoset and cynomolgus macaque normally structured transcripts appear to be expressed, though at a low level. In the human testis, two ran transcripts were characterized, hELP1 and hELP2, the products of independent duplicated genes. Both transcripts were longer than in nonmammalian species, included frame-shift mutations and substantial sequence insertions, preventing the translation of a sensible protein. Genomic PCR analysis of three anthropoid species, chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan, showed the presence of a similarly mutated hELP1 gene. Only in the gorilla was a hELP2 gene identified, apparently lacking the Frame-shift mutation, and thus potentially able to give rise to a functional ELF protein. Taken together, these results show that during primate evolution there has been a progressive inactivation of the ELF gene, initially with a down-regulation in lower primates, and subsequently with inactivating mutations in the open reading frame. At some time during simian evolution prior to these mutations there has been a gene duplication, though this second gene has also become inactivated in humans. In its pattern of evolution the ELF gene shows similarities with the MDC/fertilin family, whose members are also considered essential components of haploid sperm in non-primates, but which are progressively inactivated in anthropoids and humans. We should like to speculate that the established subfertility of the human male may not be a recent event, but the consequence of a longer evolutionary process whereby primates have traded off absolute fertility against social or sexual advantages.

A total of 142 fragments were sequenced, and the counterpart sequences were also determined in non-human primates. In humans, 10 different alleles were found; they could be grouped into seven allelic classes based on the total number of repeats. No variation was observed in the alleles 17, 18 and 19, which showed consensus sequence structures and in the allele 14, which showed a different structure. New variation was found in alleles 15, 16, and 20, which had differences occurred in a basic (TCTA)(TCTG)(n) repeat in the 5' side. The counterpart fragments were successfully amplified in three species (chimpanzees, gorilla, and orangutan) out of four kinds of anthropoids, three species (rhesus macaques, Japanese macaques, and green monkey) out of four kinds of old world monkeys, but not in one species of either new world monkey or prosimian. The sizes of the fragments distributed from 92 to 180 bp in non-human primates and showed allelic size differences in four species. The sequence of the 5' flanking region followed by primer sequences in humans and anthropoids, which consisted of 19 bp, was identical in all, but differed from that in old world monkeys. The basic repeat motifs of humans and anthropoids consisted of TCTA, TCTG, and TCCA but that of old world monkeys consisted of TCTG, TCCG and TCCA The structures of humans and anthropoids were essentially similar, but with characteristic difference in each species. Differences in the allelic structures of old world monkeys were complex. Seven different alleles were observed in two rhesus and two Japanese macaques and one type of allele was observed in two green monkeys, Duplication of more than two repeat units of 4 bp was found in an allele of an old world monkey.

Body mass in lowland gorillas: A quantitative analysis,"['Zihlman, AL', 'McFarland, RK']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/1096-8644(200009)113:1<61::AID-AJPA6>3.0.CO;2-H,SEP 2000,28,"Body proportions and tissue composition (e.g., relative contributions of muscle, skin, bone, and adipose to total body mass) were determined through dissection of four adult captive lowland gorillas. The relative contribution of bone varies little among the four animals (10.2-13.4%) despite considerable range in body weights (99.5-211 kg). In tissue composition, three animals have on average 37.3% muscle relative to body mass. Maximum estimates of body fat range between 19.4-44%. Differences in age, sex, and life history events partially explain the observed variation in body proportions and tissue composition among the four animals. Although gorillas are considered extremely sexually dimorphic in body weight and canine size, differences in tissue are not as dramatic as body mass differences suggest. This study found sex differences mostly in the upper body; males have relatively heavier forelimbs, including heavier deltoid, trunk-binding, and deep back muscles compared to the younger female. The old, obese female had one half the muscle tissue of the other three animals (16% vs. 37.3%), and twice the body fat (44%); forelimbs and upper body musculature were relatively well-developed to compensate for the restricted hip-joint movement due to arthritis. Data on the variation in tissue composition and body proportions in gorillas provide a basis for comparison with other hominoids, including humans. For example, compared to highly dimorphic orangutans, gorillas have more muscle, less adipose tissue, lighter forelimbs and heavier hindlimbs. Such analyses complement studies of the skeleton and contribute to our understanding of human evolution and adaptation. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Why bears consume mixed diets during fruit abundance,"['Rode, KD', 'Robbins, CT']",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE,10.1139/cjz-78-9-1640,SEP 2000,52,"In many ecosystems, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and black bears (Ursus americanus) feed heavily on berries and fruits in the fall. While a few birds and mammals are exclusively frugivorous, bears and most other animals consume fruit as part of a mixed diet. The mixed-diet strategy avoids potential calcium, protein, amino acid, or other nutrient deficiencies that can occur on fruit diets. However, we hypothesized that the high carbohydrate - low protein content of fruit would increase energy metabolism and force bears to use dietary mixing to meet protein requirements and, thereby, reduce energy metabolism. We examined the effects of six plant-based diets containing from 2.3 to 35% crude protein on intake, maintenance costs, and efficiency of gain of captive grizzly and black bears. In addition, the food habits of six populations of wild grizzly and black bears were analyzed, to determine the crude protein and digestible dry matter content of their diets. Efficiency of gain (0.53 +/- 0.02 (+/- SD) g gain/g digestible dry matter intake) did not differ across diets. However, maintenance costs differed, ranging from 24 g.(kg(0.75).day)(-1) (120 kcal (1 cal = 4.1868 J) digestible energy (DE).(kg(0.75).day)(-1)) on the 35% protein pelleted diet to 80 g.(kg(0.75).day)(-1) (340 kcal DE.(kg(0.75).day)(-1)) on fruit diets containing 2.3-5.6% protein (P = 0.0001). Supplementation of the fruit diet with additional protein increased mass gain but did not completely reverse the growth-depressing effect of the fruit-only diet. Protein limitations or other characteristics of fruit diets that increase energy metabolism and intake may be strategies that also directly benefit plants, by increasing either seed dispersal or propagation."

"MHC diversity in Caucasians, investigated using highly heterogeneous noncoding sequence motifs at the DQB1 locus including a retroviral long terminal repeat element, and its comparison to nonhuman primate homologues","['Donner, H', 'Tonjes, RR', 'Bontrop, RE', 'Kurth, R', 'Usadel, KH', 'Badenhoop, K']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s002510000222,SEP 2000,10,"Long terminal repeats (LTRs) are common retrovirus-related sequences spread throughout the human genome. We previously reported the human-specific integration of one LTR (DQLTR3) located 15 kb upstream of HLA DQB1. To elucidate the contribution of retroviral sequences to the variability and phylogenetic background of HLA DQB1 we investigated another LTR (DQLTR13), located 1.3 kb upstream of HLA DQB1, in German families, great apes, and Old World monkeys. Within German families, DQLTR13 presence was strongly linked to HLA DQB1""0302, *0303, and *0402 haplotypes. All other haplotypes had a low frequency or were devoid of DQLTR13. Phylogenetic analysis of DQLTR13 and adjacent nucleotide sequences in humans and nonhuman primates revealed a high degree of similarity and recent origin of HLA DeB1""0302, *0303, and *0402. Nevertheless, two lineages leading to DQB1*0301 and *0302 were generated by an ancient split of a DQB1*0301, *0302 progenitor. A third lineage consisting of DQB1*05/*06-related sequences may have evolved from the DeB1""0302 lineage, and a DQB1*0201-related sequence shared common ancestry with DQB1*0301. Among the human haplotypes, HLA DQB1*0201 and *0301 are linked to two different DQA1 alleles. Based on the small genetic distance of DQLTR13 as well as the adjacent sequences on these haplotypes, we suggest that a recent recombination is responsible for these associations. In the analysis of nonhuman primate species, we detected DQLTR13 in two lowland gorillas, dating the integration at at least 8 million years ago. We therefore conclude that noncoding sequences up to 1.3 kb upstream of DQB1 provide novel insight into the generation of MHC gene diversity."
"Gastrointestinal parasites of mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) in the Parc National des Volcans, Rwanda","['Sleeman, JM', 'Meader, LL', 'Mudakikwa, AB', 'Foster, JW', 'Patton, S']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,SEP 2000,43,"Ninety-eight fecal samples were collected from 74 free-living mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) from the pare National des Volcans. Rwanda. between July 1995 and January 1997 and examined for parasites by Sheather's sugar and zinc sulfate flotation methods, trichrome staining, and larval cultures. All samples contained at least one parasite. Seventeen endoparasites were identified. including eight protozoa, seven nematodes. one cestode, and one trematode. Two species of arthropod mite were also recovered from the fecal samples. Parasites observed on fecal examinations included strongyle/trichostrongyle-type: eggs (72/74) (representing Oesphagostomum sp., Trichostrongylus sp.. Hyostrongylus spp., and possibly Murshidia sp.), Strongyloides sp. (1/74), Trichuris trichiura (2/74), Probstmayria sp. (7/74), Anoplocephala sp.

Chilomastix sp. cysts and trophozoites (31/70). and Giardia sp. cysts (2/70). In addition, one ascarid and one trematode egg were seen. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of parasites between males and females and between age groups; however infants and juveniles appeared to have a lower prevalence of Anoplocephala gorillae. and the silverbacked males appeared to have a higher prevalence of Probstmayria sp. Parasite prevalence was consistent among the five social groups studied except Susa group had a significantly lower prevalence of Anoplocephala gorillae. Trichuris trichiura, Strongyloides sp.. Chilomastix sp.. and Endolimax nana were identified for the first time in this population. and it is possible that these parasites were of human origin. Although there were no obvious clinical effects due to the presence of these parasites, six parasites identified (Trichuris trichiura. Strongyloides sp.. Oesphagostomum sp., Trichostrongylus sp.. Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia sp.) could potentially be pathogenic. Some of the parasite products and cultured larvae could not be speciated."

Unexpectedly similar rates of nucleotide substitution found in male and female hominids,"['Bohossian, HB', 'Skaletsky, H', 'Page, DC']",NATURE,NA,AUG 10 2000,70,"In 1947, it was suggested that, in humans, the mutation rate is dramatically higher in the male germ line than in the female germ line(1). This hypothesis has been supported by the observation that, among primates, Y-linked genes evolved more rapidly than homologous X-linked genes(2-6). Based on these evolutionary studies, the ratio (alpha(m)) of male to female mutation rates in primates was estimated to be about 5. However, selection could have skewed sequence evolution in introns and exons(7-10). In addition, some of the X-Y gene pairs studied lie within chromosomal regions with substantially divergent nucleotide sequences(7,11,12). Here we directly compare human X and Y sequences within a large region with no known genes. Here the two chromosomes are 99% identical, and X-Y divergence began only three or four million years ago, during hominid evolution(13-15). In apes, homologous sequences exist only on the X chromosome. We sequenced and compared 38.6 kb of this region from human X, human Y, chimpanzee X and gorilla X chromosomes. We calculated alpha(m) to be 1.7 (95% confidence interval 1.15-2.87), significantly lower than previous estimates in primates. We infer that, in humans and their immediate ancestors, male and female mutation rates were far more similar than previously supposed."
Evolution of an Alu DNA element of type Sx in the lineage of primates and the origin of an associated tetranucleotide microsatellite,"['Crouau-Roy, B', 'Clisson, I']",GENOME,10.1139/gen-43-4-642,AUG 2000,4,"A 394-bp DNA fragment, which in human is on chromosome 6 near the MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) gene and encompasses an Alu element and an associated tetranucleotide microsatellite, was sequenced from a large range of primate species to follow its evolutionary divergence and to understand the origin of the microsatellite. This Alu element is found at the same orthologous position in all primates sequenced, but the tetranucleotide repeat is present only in Catarrhini between the 3'-oligo(dA) of the Alu element and the 3' flanking direct repeat. Little intraspecific variation was found. Sequence identity values for this orthologous primate Alu averaged 90% (82-99%) with transitions comprising between 70% and 100% of the observed nucleotide substitutions. Although the insertion of the Alu element predates the separation of these species, the original sequence of the site of integration can still be identified. This identification of the direct repeats suggests an active role of the oligo(dA) of the Alu element in the origin of the tetranucleotide repeats. The microsatellite probably appeared after the insertion of the Alu element, early in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of the hominoids and the Old World monkeys."
The influence of life history and diet on the distribution of catarrhine primates during the Pleistocene in eastern Asia,"['Jablonski, NG', 'Whitfort, MJ', 'Roberts-Smith, N', 'Xu, QQ']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.2000.0405,AUG 2000,59,"Environmental changes during the Pleistocene in eastern Asia had profound impacts on the distributions of mammalian groups. Critical for many mammals were the southward latitudinal shifts of the tropical and subtropical vegetational zones, and decreases in the areas of these zones. Examination of the responses of members of a single clade, the Catarrhini, indicates that the main catarrhine genera of eastern Asia responded individually to the environmental changes in the Pleistocene. These responses were influenced by the life history parameters and diets of the genera involved. Those animals (macaques, langurs) with shorter gestation times, shorter weaning periods, shorter interbirth intervals, higher intrinsic rates of increase of population, and abilities to survive on a wider variety of vegetation in seasonal habitats were less adversely affected than those (gibbons, orang-utans and the giant extinct hominoid, Gigantopithecus) with more protracted reproductive schedules, lower intrinsic rates of population increase and preferences for the higher quality foods (especially ripe fruits) of less seasonal environments. Hominids, while displaying ""hyper-ape"" life history parameters, increasingly overcame the constraints of these parameters through extrasomatic means not available to other catarrhines. This ability made possible their colonization, by the Late Pleistocene, of highly seasonal habitats such as tundra, which were off-limits to non-culture-bearing catarrhines.

Degenerative joint disease in African great apes: an evolutionary perspective,"['Jurmain, R']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.2000.0413,AUG 2000,23,"Degenerative joint disease is investigated in the spine and major peripheral joints (shoulder, elbow, hip and knee) in samples of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii; P. troglodytes troglodytes), lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and bonobos (P. paniscus). The P. troglodytes schweinfurthii sample comes from Gombe National Park, Tanzania, while the other samples are derived from museum materials originally collected in west/central Africa. Total data for African ape samples include 5807 surfaces for ascertainment of vertebral osteophytosis, 12,479 surfaces for determination of spinal osteoarthritis, and 1211 joints for evaluation of peripheral joint osteoarthritis. All apes display significantly less spinal disease than in a comparable human sample, and these differences are most likely a consequence of human biomechanical adaptations for bipedal locomotion. Apes are also generally less involved in the major peripheral joints than are humans, but human groups are themselves highly variable in prevalence of peripheral osteoarthritis. These data agree with other findings of low prevalence of degenerative joint prevalence in free-ranging apes, but contrast markedly with evidence derived from colony-reared Old World monkeys.

Infection of nonhuman primate cells by pig endogenous retrovirus,"['Blusch, JH', 'Patience, C', 'Takeuchi, Y', 'Templin, C', 'Roos, C', 'Von der Helm, K', 'Steinhoff, G', 'Martin, U']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.74.16.7687-7690.2000,AUG 2000,59,"The ongoing shortage of human donor organs for transplantation has catalyzed new interest in the application of pig organs (xenotransplantation). One of the biggest concerns about the transplantation of porcine grafts into humans is the transmission of pig endogenous retroviruses (PERV) to the recipients or even to other members of the community. Although nonhuman primate models are excellently suited to mimic clinical xenotransplantation settings, their value for risk assessment of PERV transmission at xenotransplantation is questionable since all of the primate cell lines tested so far have been found to be nonpermissive for PERV infection. Here we demonstrate that human, gorilla, and Papio hamadryas primary skin fibroblasts and also baboon B-cell lines are permissive for PERV infection. This suggests that a reevaluation of the suitability of the baboon model for risk assessment in xenotransplantation is critical at this point."
Linear enamel hypoplasia in gibbons (Hylobates lar carpenteri),"['Guatelli-Steinberg, D']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/1096-8644(200007)112:3<395::AID-AJPA9>3.0.CO;2-H,JUL 2000,15,"This study describes the expression of linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH), a sensitive dental indicator of physiological stress, in Thailand gibbons (Hylobates lar carpenteri). Previous studies of enamel hypoplasia in hominoids have focused on great apes, with little attention given to the expression of this stress indicator in gibbons. In that gibbons differ from both monkeys and great apes in numerous life history features, LEH expression in gibbons might be expected to show significant differences from both. In this study, 92 gibbon specimens from two sites in Thailand were compared with several samples of monkeys and great apes in their expression of LEH. The intertooth distribution of LEH in gibbons was compared to that of chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys. Gibbon populations from both sites exhibit LEH frequencies intermediate between those of the monkey samples, in which LEH prevalence is usually low, and those of the great ape samples, in which LEH prevalence is high. Gibbons differ significantly from monkeys, but not great apes, in the number of individuals whose teeth record multiple stress events. Multiple episodes of stress are rarely recorded in the teeth of monkeys, while multiple stress events occur with higher frequency in gibbons and great apes. Taxonomic variation in the duration of crown formation, the prominence and spacing of perikymata on dental crowns, life history features, and/or experience of physiological stress may explain these patterns. The intertooth distribution of LEH in gibbons is, for different reasons, unlike that of either chimpanzees or rhesus monkeys. The mandibular canines of gibbons have significantly more LEH than any of their other teeth. Aspects of crown morphology, perikymata prominence/spacing, enamel thickness, and crown formation spans are potential causes of taxonomic variation in the intertooth distribution of LEH.

Reproductive monitoring of free-ranging female mountain gorillas by urinary hormone analysis,"['Czekala, N', 'Sicotte, P']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/1098-2345(200007)51:3<209::AID-AJP6>3.0.CO;2-6,JUL 2000,12,"Frequent urine samples from three habituated free-ranging adult female mountain gorillas were collected during a four-week period in order to characterize, by analysis of urinary hormones, their ovarian cycle, and to diagnose pregnancy. A conceptive cycle and two cycles that did not result in full term pregnancy were monitored. Behavioral and physiological observations of mating and labial swellings were correlated to urinary hormone results. Mating occurred on days with elevated estrogens. Labial swelling was maximum near or at peak estrogen levels. Pregnancy was diagnosed at the field site by measurement of chorionic gonadotropin using commercially available human pregnancy detection kits. In one pregnancy, gestation length was 254 days. The pregnanediol glucuronide concentrations of the mountain gorilla did not change during the nonconceptive cycle. During the conceptive cycle, the concentrations did not increase until the approximate time of implantation. This finding suggests marked differences in steroid production or metabolism between the mountain gorilla and the captive lowland gorilla. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Ecology and social organisation of African rainforest primates: relevance for understanding the transmission of retroviruses.,"['Tutin, CEG']",BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE DE PATHOLOGIE EXOTIQUE,NA,JUL 2000,10,"The risk of transmission of primate viruses to humans is great because of their genetic proximity. It is now clear that the HIV group of retroviruses came from primates and that the origin of HIV1 is the chimpanzee subspecies of Central Africa, Pan troglodytes troglodytes. Many African primates are natural hosts of retroviruses and details of the natural history of both hosts and viruses are essential to understand the evolution of the latter Data on the demography ecology and behaviour of three species of primates (gorillas, chimpanzees and mandrills), studied in the Lope Reserve in Central Gabon since 1983, are analysed to identify the factors that allow, or favour disease transmission within each species, between different species and between primates and humans. The comparison of the relative degree of risk suggests that of the three species, chimpanzees are the most susceptible to exposure to infection both from conspecifics and from other species. With respect to humans, the comparative analysis suggests greater exposure to viruses of mandrills and gorillas than to those of chimpanzees. For primates, major risk factors are: large social groups; bites inflicted in fights; social grooming; and predation on mammals. However given that contacts between social groups of the same species are rare, the spread of a virus through a population will be slow and uncertain. Hunting wild animals is the behaviour most likely to provide transmission routes for primate viruses into human populations because of the high probability of blood-blood contact. Not only the hunters themselves, but also women who prepare bush meat for cooking and people involved in trade of carcasses are at high risk of transmission of pathogens. Hunting of bush meat is increasing in Central Africa due to the economic recession and the spread of logging into the forests of the interior of the region. To counter the significant risk of transmission of known, as well as new, diseases from primates to humans, urgent measures are needed to attack the root causes of commercial hunting which is not only risk to public health but also a serious threat to biodiversity in the region."
Representing space and objects in monkeys and apes,"['Call, J']",COGNITIVE SCIENCE,NA,JUL-SEP 2000,23,"Primate foraging con be construed as a set of interconnected problems that include finding food, selecting efficient travel routes, anticipating the positions of moving prey, and manipulating, and occasionally, extracting food items using tools. The evidence reviewed in this paper strongly suggests that both monkeys and apes use three types of representation (i.e., static, dynamic, and relational) to solve various problems. Static representations involve recoiling certain features of the environment, dynamic representations involve imagining changes in the trajectories of moving objects, and relational representations involve encoding the properties of objects in relation to other objects. Contrary to previous claims, no clear differences were found between the representational skills of monkeys and apes. Current evidence also suggests that primates may be better at representing general compared to specific problem features. Finally, we have characterized the domains of space and objects as complementary and indicated future lines of research in these domains."

Elliptical Fourier analysis of symphyseal shape in great ape mandibles,"['Daegling, DJ', 'Jungers, WL']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.2000.0402,JUL 2000,33,"The midsagittal profile of the mandibular symphysis has served as both a taxonomic marker and a phylogenetically salient character in debates over hominoid evolution. Nevertheless, the utility of symphyseal shape as an informative attribute for paleobiological reconstructions is suspect. Quantification of shape variation has proven to be particularly problematic; it has long been recognized that conventional linear measurements (and the indices derived from them), while replicable, summarize aspects of shape very poorly because of the vast amount of contour information that is lost in the process.

In this study, a type of Fourier analysis is applied to cross-sectional contours of ape mandibles in order to provide a mathematical accounting of shape variation in a ""global"" sense; that is, by applying the ""totality"" of contour information in a comparative analysis. Shape variation in the mandibular symphysis is explored through the decomposition of coordinate data into elliptical Fourier coefficients. These coefficients are used to compute average taxonomic distances (ATD) among individuals of chimpanzees, gorillas, and orang-utans. The resulting shape-based distances are summarized via clustering (UPGMA) and ordination (principal coordinates analysis-PCO). Principal coordinate scores are subjected to analysis of variance in univariate and multivariate designs; these data are also applied to discriminant function analyses.

Species and sex effects on morphology are statistically significant; however, no significant interaction of these factors is indicated. This would seem to imply that patterns of sexual dimorphism are not distinct among great apes; to the contrary, within-species sex comparisons reveal that significant size and shape dimorphism is present only in Gorilla. Despite significant size dimorphism in Pan and Pongo, significant shape differences between males and females are not apparent in these taxa.

These results suggest that it is theoretically possible to sort taxa by a symphyseal shape criterion, but the discriminant function results suggest that there still exists a large potential for error in assigning particular shapes to a given species or sex. Thus, despite real shape differences among these species, the use of symphyseal shape as a character in species identification or in systematic arguments remains limited and problematic.

All chimpanzees examined shared only the 17.5 repeat allele, while polymorphism was observed in the other apes and the 16 and 20 repeat alleles were most frequent in gorillas and orang-utans, respectively. 5-HTTLPR was highly polymorphic in gibbons and the 17 and 23 repeat alleles were most common among 5 alleles.

Twenty per cent of chimpanzees and 14% of gorillas were affected with a disseminated inflammatory skeletal condition caused by infection. The lesions appear to have originated as localized patches of new bone deposition on the surface of long bones and to have progressed to infection of the bone cortex and marrow. Although female prevalence of involvement exceeds that of males in both species, the differences are not statistically significant. The age distribution of affected animals indicates that the disease began in some animals as early as 2 yr of age. Given the skeletal and demographic prevalence and patterning of the lesions as well as the ecology and behavior of these animals, the most likely diagnosis of the condition is a yaws-like treponemal infection."
Structure analysis of CCR5 from human and primates,"['Yang, J', 'Zhang, YW', 'Huang, JF', 'Zhang, YP', 'Liu, CQ']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE-THEOCHEM,10.1016/S0166-1280(99)00393-0,JUN 26 2000,4,"It is well known that the chemokine receptor CCR5 plays very important roles in HIV-1 virus infection. A three-dimensional molecular model of human CCR5 was generated by SYBYL, a distance geometry-based homologous modeling package, using the corresponding transmembrane domain of bacteriorhodopsin as the template. On the basis of human CCR5 model, we also built 18 3D molecular models of CCR5 in primates from Pongo pygmaeus, Pygathrix nemaeus, Macaca assameniss, Trachy-pithecus phayrei, T. francoisi, M. arotoides, Rhinopithecus roxellance, R, bieti, R. avunculus, Hylobates leucogenys, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Cercopithecus aethiops 1, C. aethiops 2, Papio hamadryas M. mulatta, M. fascicularis and M. nemestrina. Structural analyses and statistics results suggested that the main-chains of the primate CCR5 were similar to that of the human CCR5 and that the fit-RMS deviation values of these primate CCR5 were less than 0.1 Angstrom. Moreover, the structures of these CCR5 proteins, except those of the African green monkey 1 (C.aet1), do not have a remarkable difference. It is proved that the 14th residue is possibly very important in the inhibition infections by M-tropic HIV-1, and it is also demonstrated that the 13th residue of human CCR5 was changed from asparagine into aspartic acid in all these primates. It means that the primate CCR5 no longer depend on CD4 for efficient entry, but human CCR5 may have evolved subsequently due to the use of CD4 as a receptor, allowing the high-affinity chemokine receptor-binding site of HIV to be sequestered from host immune surveillance.

Alu-mediated phylogenetic novelties in gene regulation and development,"['Hamdi, HK', 'Nishio, H', 'Tavis, J', 'Zielinski, R', 'Dugaiczyk, A']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,10.1006/jmbi.2000.3795,JUN 16 2000,53,"Differential gene expression lies at the heart of biology and is responsible for all developmental processes, including the growth and differentiation of cells. Perhaps even speciation could be defined as a change in differential gene expression over evolutionary time. The present work is a phylogenetic study of four Alu elements known to have gene regulatory functions in the human. The four elements have been shown to regulate the parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene via a negative calcium-response element, the hematopoietic cell-specific Fc epsilon RT-gamma receptor gene via a cis-acting positive/negative regulatory element, the CNS-specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 3 gene via a cis-acting positive/negative control element, and the T-cell-specific CD8 alpha gene via a complex transcriptional regulator. The four Alu elements that impact differential gene expression were found to be differentially distributed among seven primate species (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, baboon, rhesus, and macaque) in a way that is congruent with an accepted phylogeny of these species. The results establish a link between gene regulation and the divergence of primates. This evolutionary variation in gene regulation also suggests a novel experimental system to study the very complex transcriptional regulation of gene expression, by studying side-by-side the regulation of the same gene from two primate species that differ in the cis-acting regulatory elements of the gene.

"Obstetric management of a protracted labor in a captive Western lowland gorilla
","['Cole, RE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY,10.1067/mob.2000.106185,JUN 2000,1,"This article discusses the cooperative efforts of a team of physicians and veterinarians resulting in the successful assisted vaginal delivery of a Western lowland gorilla at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle. Washington. A IO-year-old, captive-born female gorilla, gravida 3, para 0, aborta 2, was observed to be in labor at term after spontaneous rupture of membranes. After 36 hours of observation, she had not yet delivered her infant. A team of physicians and veterinarians intervened. After induction of general anesthesia. an assessment of fetal and maternal status was made. With ultrasonographic monitoring of fetal cardiac activity, labor was augmented with administration of intravenous oxytocin. A vaginal delivery was performed with a vacuum extractor, resulting in the birth of a viable, 2.4-kg female infant. The infant survived the neonatal period and was hand reared until she was successfully introduced to the gorilla troop at the age of 1 year. Although there are several cases of cesarean delivery in captive gorillas, this is the first reported use of labor augmentation and assisted vaginal delivery in this captive species. Captive breeding is the key to survival of the Western lowland gorilla. The collaborative work of physicians and veterinarians is an integral part of this successful program. It is reported that in the captive population approximately 30% of newborns die in the first year, with more than half of the deaths occurring just before birth or within the first day of life. This does not include early spontaneous pregnancy losses. With aggressive management of pregnancy and labor complications, it may be possible to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality in the captive gorilla population. Because gorillas are closely related to humans, with the only closer relative being the chimpanzee, it is probable that the basic principles of obstetric management in humans can be safely and appropriately applied to the captive gorilla population. With the exception of this report and the cited cesarean delivery reports, there are no other references to cross-species studies of active intervention in gorillas with human obstetric techniques. It is hoped that an increased awareness on the part of obstetricians of the importance of their knowledge and skill to toes will lead to more successful outcomes in the captive gorilla population."

Nutr. 118:1082-1088; Lambert [1997] Ph.D. Dissertation), although gastrointestinal morphology and proportions are roughly similar among species (Chivers and Hladik [1980] J. Morphol. 166:337-386). This study provides additional experimental data on the gastrointestinal passage times of gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) fed a captive diet in a zoological park setting and discusses results in relation to field research on gorilla feeding ecology. In this study, 480 small plastic markers were fed to six captive gorillas. The mean gut retention time (MRT) of the adult gorillas in this study was 50 hr, longer than the 31 hr reported for chimpanzees fed a similar diet (Lambert [1997] Ph.D. Dissertation). These data suggest that gorillas may retain foods in their gastrointestinal tracts longer than smaller hominoids, and that the large body size likely forms the primary basis for consumption of fiber. This research provides additional data to contribute to our understanding of the relationships of body size and morphology to ecology, and the evolution of body size, foraging strategy and social organization among the African apes.

Sera originate from German, French, Thai, and Vietnamese primate-keeping institutions. To estimate the phylogenetic relationships, we sequenced two genomic regions, one located within the pre-S1/pre-S2 region and one including parts of the polymerase and the X protein open reading frames. By comparison with published human and ape HBV isolates, the sequences could be classified into six genomic groups. Four of these represented new genomic groups of gibbon HBV variants. The gorilla HBV isolate was distantly related to the chimpanzee isolate described previously. To confirm these findings, the complete HBV genome from representatives of each genomic group was sequenced. The HBV isolates from gibbons living in different regions of Thailand and Vietnam could be classified into four different phylogenetically distinct genomic groups. The same genomic groups were found in animals from European toes. Therefore, the HBV infections of these apes might have been introduced into European primate-keeping facilities by direct import of already infected animals from different regions in Thailand. Taken together, our data suggest that HBV infections are indigenous in the different apes, One event involving transmission between human and nonhuman primates in the Old World of a common ancestor of human HBV genotypes A to E and the ape HBV variants might have occurred."
Evaluation of a human immunometric assay for the determination of thyroid-stimulating hormone in nonhuman primates,"['Lair, S', 'Crawshaw, GJ', 'Mehren, KG', 'Perrone, MA']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,JUN 2000,3,"Sera from nine species of clinically healthy nonhuman primates were assayed for T-4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) using human immunoassays (a fluorescence polarization immunoassay for T-4, a microparticle enzyme immunoassay for TSH). The T-4 levels ranged from 20 to 132 nmol/L ((x) over bar +/- SD = 62.8 +/- 24.7 nmol/L). Levels of TSH were detected only in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and Sumatran orang-utans (Pongo pygmaeus abelii) (range, 0.4-10.8 mIU/L; detectable limit = 0.01 mIU/L). The results suggest that the antibodies used in the commercial TSH immunoassay assessed in this study cross-react with gorilla and orang-utan TSH but not with TSH of primates of the genera Macaca, Papio, Erythrocebus, Ateles, Leontopithecus, and Lemur."
Geophagy among primates: adaptive significance and ecological consequences,"['Krishnamani, R', 'Mahaney, WC']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1006/anbe.1999.1376,MAY 2000,100,"We review geophagy, or soil ingestion, in primates. This behaviour is widespread and is presumed to be important to health and nutrition. Primates may engage in geophagy for one-or a combination of reasons. Here we present, and make a preliminary assessment of, six nonexclusive hypotheses that may contribute to the prevalence of geophagy. Four hypotheses relate to geophagy in alleviating gastrointestinal disorders or upsets: (1) soils adsorb toxins such as phenolics and secondary metabolites; (2) soil ingestion has an antacid action and adjusts the gut pH; (3) soils act as an antidiarrhoeal agent; and (4) soils counteract the effects of endoparasites. Two hypotheses pertain to geophagy in supplementing minerals and/or elements: (5) soils supplement nutrient-poor diets and (6) soils provide extra iron at high altitudes. In addition to these hypotheses, geophagy may satiate olfactory senses, serve as a famine food and finally may have no function at all. We draw together a large body of information from various sources to assess these hypotheses and suggest some tests to understand the function of geophagy. Our review suggests that primates engage in geophagy for a number of reasons that are nonexclusive. We conclude that mineral supplementation, adsorption of toxins, treatment of diarrhoea and pH adjustment of the gut seem the most plausible reasons why primates engage in geophagy.

Statistical analyses of metric data of hominoid teeth found in Yuanmou of China,"['Liu, W', 'Zheng, L', 'Jiang, C']",CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN,10.1007/BF02886204,MAY 2000,15,"Mesial-distal and buccal-lingual dimensions of 1 266 hominoid teeth found in Yuanmou of Yunnan Province during the period of 1986 and 1988 have been measured. The statistical analyses of the metric data show that the tooth sizes of Yuanmou hominoid can be divided into big and small two types, and most tooth dimensions display obvious bimodalities in both histograms and 2 dimensional plots. The coefficients of variance (CV) reveal that the CVs of Yuanmou hominoid tooth sizes are within or close to the CV ranges of Lufengpithecus and extant great apes. The comparisons of tooth sizes and their proportions indicate that Yuanmou hominoids have close affinities with Lefeng and Kaiyuan hominoids, and have obvious differences with Gorilla, Chimpanzee and Orangutan. The authors believe that the hominoid fossils found in Yuanmou in the past 10 years represent a single species with highly sexual dimorphism in morphology and this species may have a close evolutionary relationship with the hominoids found in Kaiyuan and Lufeng."
Prevalence and etiology of linear enamel hypoplasia in monkeys and apes from Asia and Africa,"['Guatelli-Steinberg, D', 'Skinner, M']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000021740,MAY-JUN 2000,22,"Ninety-seven specimens of sympatric monkeys and apes from East Malaysia and 115 monkeys and apes from West Africa are examined in order to evaluate the magnitude and nature of the great ape-monkey linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) 'dichotomy', This study demonstrates that great apes from both regions have a higher incidence of LEH and repetitive LEH than do gibbons and monkeys. However, the authors find that the dichotomy is not as clear-cut as previous research suggests, since some monkey samples exhibit high LEH frequencies. The authors evaluate the potential influence of great ape-monkey differences in crown height on this dichotomy, They show that canine crown height variation is weakly associated with LEH variation.

"Phylogenetic origin of human chromosomes 7, 16, and 19 and their homologs in placental mammals","['Richard, F', 'Lombard, M', 'Dutrillaux, B']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.10.5.644,MAY 2000,41,"The origin of human chromosomes (HSA) 7, 16, and 19 was studied by comparing data obtained from chromosome banding, chromosome painting, and gene mapping in species belonging to II orders of placental mammals (Eutherians). This allowed us to propose the reconstruction of their presumed ancestral forms. The HSA7 homologs were composed of two parts, the largest Forming an acrocentric. The smallest formed one al-m of a small submetacentric; the other arm was composed of sequences homologous to the short arm of HSA16 (HSA16p). The sequences homologous to the long arm of HSA16 (HSA16q) were associated with sequences homologous to the long arm of HSA19 (HSA19q) and formed another submetacentric. from their origin, these chromosomes underwent the following rearrangements to give rise to current human chromosomes: centromeric fission of the two submetacentrics in ancestors of all primates (similar to 80 million years ago); fusion of the HSA19p and HSA19q sequences, originating the current HSA19, in ancestors of all simians (similar to 55 million years ago); fusions of the HSA16p and HSA16q sequences, originating the current HSA16 and the two components of HSA7 before the separation of Cercopithecoids and Hominoids (similar to 35 million years ago); and finally, pericentric and paracentric inversions of the homologs to HSA7 after the divergence of orangutan and gorilla, respectively. Thus, competed with HSA16 and HSA19, HSA7 is a Fairly recent chromosome shared by man and chimpanzee only."

These observations suggest that they are derived from a relatively recent duplication event. Previously a study of nonhuman primate RH-like genes demonstrated that ancestral RH gene duplication occurred in the common ancestor of man, chimpanzees and gorillas. By amplification of intron 3 and intron 4 of gorilla RH-like genes, we have now shown that, like man, gorillas possess two types of RH intron 3 (RHCE intron 3 being 289 bp longer than the RHD intron 3) and two types of intron 4 (RHCE intron 4 being 654 bp longer than the RHD intron 4), Here we report the characterization of a cDNA encoded by a gorilla RH-like gene which possesses introns 3 and 4 of the RHCE type. A comparison of this gorilla RHCE-like coding sequence with previously characterized human and ape cDNA sequences suggests that RH genes experienced complex recombination events after duplication in the common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees and gorillas."

These new data do not support the proposal that increased encephalization is a shared feature between Paranthropus and early Homo.

How reliable are human phylogenetic hypotheses?,"['Collard, M', 'Wood, B']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.97.9.5003,APR 25 2000,149,"Cladistic analysis of cranial and dental evidence has been widely used to generate phylogenetic hypotheses about humans and their fossil relatives. However. the reliability of these hypotheses has never been subjected to external validation. To rectify this, we applied identical methods to equivalent evidence from two groups of extant higher primates for whom reliable molecular phylogenies are available, the hominoids and papionins. We found that the phylogenetic hypotheses based on the craniodental data were incompatible with the molecular phylogenies for the groups. Given the robustness of the molecular phylogenies. these results indicate that little confidence can be placed in phylogenies generated solely from higher primate craniodental evidence. The corollary of this is that existing phylogenetic hypotheses about human evolution are unlikely to be reliable. Accordingly, new approaches are required to address the problem of hominin phylogeny."

For a decade my research group has been conducting basic research to establish embryo manipulation techniques and to clarify the reproductive phenomena in nonhuman primates. This article summarizes the past research on in vitro manipulation of nonhuman primate gametes, from collection of reproductive cells and in vitro fertilization to the birth of offspring after embryo transfer, as well as the current status of these research areas. The studies summarized here will directly lead to the development of standard techniques for practical and comprehensive use in nonhuman primates."
Monitoring mammal populations with line transect techniques in African forests,"['Plumptre, AJ']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00499.x,APR 2000,134,"1. Line transect survey techniques have been used to estimate population density for a variety of mammal species in tropical forests. In many cases indirect methods, surveying signs of animals such as counts of dung or nests, have been used because of the poor visibility in these forests. The estimates of the production and decomposition rates of these signs each have their associated errors; however, for the majority of published studies these errors have not been incorporated into the estimate of the standard errors or confidence limits of the density estimate. An equation is given showing how this should be done.

2. An equation is also given relating the resolution (R) of a density estimate to the coefficient of variation (CV) of the estimate. This shows that to detect a 10% change in a population the CV must be 3.6% (with a power of 50%) or 2.4% (with 80% power). Using this equation and data from studies in Africa, it is shown that differences of less than 10-30% change in the population are unlikely to be detected between two surveys where visual sightings of animals are made. When indirect methods of estimating the population are used, it is unlikely that less than a 30-50% change in the population could be detected.

3. Some studies have surveyed primate groups using estimates of an average group spread. Data from primate groups in Budongo Forest, Uganda, show that group spread is highly variable and varies at different times of day and between months. This survey technique is not recommended.

4. If line transects are used for monitoring populations, conversion factors should be minimized as each contributes to an increase in the CV and a reduction in the ability to detect small changes in population density.

5. Monitoring trends in abundance over several survey periods can improve the detection of change, although this is costly and requires several surveys before any conclusions can be reached. Re-using transects in subsequent surveys can also reduce the variation around the estimate and will improve the resolution. Focusing survey efforts in areas of high density is an alternative strategy, but one that could lead to other errors as high-density areas may be the safest and hence the last to show change. Using biased survey methods is also a promising technique that can increase the precision of surveys. It is concluded that a combination of different survey methods will ensure that changes in abundance are identified."
The place of Neandertals in the evolution of hominid patterns of growth and development,"['Thompson, JL', 'Nelson, AJ']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1999.0364,APR 2000,26,This study uses the two developmental fields of dental maturation and femoral growth to determine if the pattern of growth and development in Neandertals (archaic Homo sapiens) was intermediate between that of Homo erectus and recent modern humans. Specimens used in the analysis included Neandertals and Upper Palaeolithic early modern Homo sapiens from Europe and individuals from two recent modern human populations. Ontogenetic data for the H. erectus adolescent KNM-WT 15000 and for Gorilla gorilla were included for comparison. Previous reports have indicated that H. erectus demonstrates a pattern of ontogeny characterized by earlier and more rapid linear growth than in modem humans. Results reported here demonstrate that Upper Paleolithic early modem Homo sapiens display a growth trajectory indistinguishable from that of recent modern humans. The pattern of Neandertal ontogeny is not intermediate between the pattern displayed in H. erectus and the derived pattern seen in the modern reference samples and the early modem H. sapiens sample. The Neandertal growth trajectory is consistent with either slow linear growth or advanced dental development. (C) 2000 Academic Press.
Spatial memory and foraging competition in captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Gibeault, S', 'MacDonald, SE']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557796,APR 2000,19,"Spatial memory and foraging competition were investigated in three mother/offspring pairs of western lowland gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla, using a naturalistic foraging task at the Toronto Zoo. Sixteen permanent food sites were placed throughout the animals' enclosures. All of the sites were baited and a pair of animals was free to visit the sites and collect the food. Five of the subjects collected the food with accuracy better than chance. Most of the subjects visited the sites using a pattern, and for half the subjects this was one of adjacency. The high accuracy of five of the subjects and the lack of a consistent adjacency pattern suggest that the animals did in fact use spatial memory. Furthermore, the gorillas tended to avoid visiting food sites that had been previously depleted by their partner. They also appeared to split their search of the enclosures, each visiting only a proportion of the food sites. This indicated that the animals were competing and altering their foraging behaviour based on the behaviour of their partner. Therefore, accuracy was recalculated to take this into account. When the sites depleted by either animal in a pair during a given trial were worked into the accuracy calculations for individual animals, three of the animals still maintained accuracy above chance. This suggests that the animals were not only able to remember which sites they had depleted, but those sites depleted by their foraging partner as well."

Evidence that humans evolved from a knuckle-walking ancestor,"['Richmond, BG', 'Strait, DS']",NATURE,10.1038/35006045,MAR 23 2000,121,"Bipedalism has traditionally been regarded as the fundamental adaptation that sets hominids apart from other primates. Fossil I evidence demonstrates that by 4.1 million years ago(1), and perhaps earlier(2), hominids exhibited adaptations to bipedal walking. At present, however, the fossil record offers little information about the origin of bipedalism, and despite nearly a century of research on existing fossils and comparative anatomy, there is still no consensus concerning the mode of locomotion that preceded bipedalism(3-10). Here we present evidence that fossils attributed to Australopithecus anamensis (KNM-ER 20419)(11) and A. afarensis (AL 288-1)(12) retain specialized wrist morphology associated with knuckle-walking. This distal radial morphology differs from that of later hominids and non-knuckle-walking anthropoid primates, suggesting that knuckle-walking is a derived feature of the African ape and human clads. This removes key morphological evidence for a Pan-Gorilla clade, and suggests that bipedal hominids evolved from a knuckle-walking ancestor that was already partly terrestrial."
Species-specific regulation of alternative splicing in the C-terminal region of the p53 tumor suppressor gene,"['Laverdiere, M', 'Beaudoin, J', 'Lavigueur, A']",NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH,10.1093/nar/28.6.1489,MAR 15 2000,24,"Alternative splicing occurs in the C-terminal region of the p53 tumor suppressor gene between two alternative 3' splice sites in intron 10, This alternative splicing event has been detected in murine cells, but not in rat or human tissues. In this paper, we have characterized the pattern of p53 alternative splicing in cell lines from five different species. Our results confirm that p53 alternative splicing is species-specific, being detected only in cell lines of rodent origin. Using transient transfection assays, we have established that the rat p53 gene undergoes efficient alternative splicing in both mouse and rat cell lines, thus demonstrating that it has all the necessary cis-acting sequences to be alternatively spliced. In contrast, we were unable to detect any usage of the human alternative 3' splice site under the same experimental conditions. Thus, the low levels or absence of alternatively spliced p53 mRNA in rat and human cell lines seems to be the result of different mechanisms, Our results support the hypothesis that there are species-specific mechanisms implicated in the regulation of p53 activity."

Comparison with previous studies is complicated by the diversity of techniques used and interpretations. The Ugandan population had relatively many intestinal protozoa, including the probably beneficial entodiniomorph ciliates. Strongyloid nematodes are universal among chimpanzees, but were surprisingly absent from those on Mount Assirik in Senegal. Railletina tapeworms are sporadic in their occurrence. The absence of spiruroid nematodes in the Ugandan population reflects the absence of insectivory in this population. There was little evidence of seasonal difference in prevalences."

The majority of deleted patients share a common 3 Nib hemizygous deletion of 22q11.2. The remaining patients include those who have smaller deletions that are nested within the 3 Mb typically deleted region (TDR) and a few with rare deletions that have no overlap with the TDR. The identification of chromosome 22-specific duplicated sequences or low copy repeats (LCRs) near the end-points of the 3 Mb TDR has led to the hypothesis that they mediate deletions of 22q11.2. The entire 3 Mb TDR has been sequenced, permitting detailed investigation of the LCRs and their involvement in the 22q11.2 deletions. Sequence analysis has identified four LCRs within the 3 Mb TDR. Although the LCRs differ in content and organization of shared modules, those modules that are common between them share 97-98% sequence identity with one another. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, the end-points of four variant 22q11.2 deletions appear to localize to the LCRs, Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization have been used to identify rearranged junction fragments from three variant deletions. Analysis of junction fragments by PCR and sequencing of the PCR products implicate the LCRs directly in the formation of 22q11.2 deletions. The evolutionary origin of the duplications on chromosome 22 has been assessed by FISH analysis of non-human primates. Multiple signals in Old World monkeys suggest that the duplication events may have occurred at least 20-25 million years ago."
A new morphometric analysis of the hominid pelvic bone,"['Marchal, F', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1999.0360,MAR 2000,16,"This study is based upon a new morphometric technique providing both size and shape variables. It has been applied to 189 pelvic bones of extant humans and African apes as well as to 13 hominid pelvic bones of various taxonomic status. The main aim of this work is to include such fossil bones in the same study in order to set a synthetic comparison of their shape in the light of the yardstick given by the African ape/human pelvic bone comparison. To do so, ratio diagrams are chosen because they are simple and very expressive tools with which to present such comparisons. Shape differences are very well illustrated and quantified by this technique. The ilium appears to be the most different of the three parts of the pelvic bone. Compared to these differences, discrepancies between fossil hominid and extant human bones are of a totally different scale. This shows the architectural unity related to the acquisition of bipedalism by hominids. It is nonetheless possible to detect two levels of difference. The first separates Australopithecus from Homo and could be seen as reflecting locomotor differences between both genera. The second splits both Homo erectus and Neanderthal from modem human pelvic bones. It appears from the hominid fossil record of pelvic bones that two periods of stasis exist and are separated by a period of very rapid evolution corresponding to the emergence of the genus Homo. We are of the opinion that the same could be true for the split between African ape and hominid lineages at the end of the Miocene. (C) 2000 Academic Press."
Isometric scaling of maxillary sinus volume in hominoids,"['Rae, TC', 'Koppe, T']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1999.0357,MAR 2000,40,"Previous hypotheses of maxillary sinus size evolution have proposed one or more changes in the volume of the structure across hominoid phylogeny. These hypotheses have been used subsequently to support the phylogenetic placement of fossil taxa relative to the living Hominoidea. The null hypothesis, that no change in sinus volume independent of size has occurred in ape evolution, is evaluated here by scaling analysis. Mixed sex samples of adult dry crania for the extant ape genera were examined by computer tomography imaging and the volume of the maxillary sinus was obtained. Sinus volume was then regressed, using both least squares and reduced major axis models, against cranial size variables.

The results clearly demonstrate that the null hypothesis of no change in relative sinus volume cannot be rejected; thus, there is no support for hypotheses that maxillary sinus volume, independent of cranial size, has changed in the course of hominoid evolution. This result, in turn, has implications for the phylogenetic placement of fossil taxa and highlights the need for the careful delineation of character states in studies of hominoid systematics.

Ancient origin of the null allele se(428) of the human ABO-Secretor locus (FUT2),"['Koda, Y', 'Tachida, H', 'Soejima, M', 'Takenaka, O', 'Kimura, H']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,NA,MAR 2000,23,"Tn human populations, a null allele having several nucleotide differences from the wild-type allele is segregating at the FUT2 locus (the ABO-Secretor locus) encoding alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase. To estimate the age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of these two alleles, we sequenced FUT2 homologues from chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and green monkey. Since we did not detect acceleration or any heterogeneity in the substitution rate at this locus among these species, the age of the MRCA was estimated to be around 3 MYA, assuming the divergence time of human and chimpanzee to be 5 MYA. We developed a simple test to examine whether or not the old age of the MRCA of the FUT2 is consistent with that expected for two divergent neutral alleles sampled from a random mating population. An application of the test to the data at FUT2 indicated that the age of the MRCA is too old to be explained by the simple neutral assumptions, although our test depends on accurate estimation of the divergence time of human and chimpanzee in units of twice the human population size. Various possibilities including balancing selection are discussed to explain this old age of the MRCA."

Sixteen procedures were pel formed to remove snares or to treat snare-related wounds, and four of the animals died without recovering consciousness because of their severe medical conditions. Ketamine was used for induction 19 times, tiletamine/zolazepam was used five times, and the agent was nor recorded for two procedures. The mean (+/- SD) ketamine dosage for four animals of known weight was 7.1 +/- 0.9 mg/kg. All induction agents were delivered i.m. by remote injection, and mean induction times for ketamine and tiletamine/zolazepam were 5.5 +/- 2.6 min (n = 12) and 5.4 +/- 3.7 min (n = 5), respectively. Mean recovery times were significantly shorter with ketamine compared with tiletamine/zolazepam (42.0 +/- 24.9 min, n = 9 vs. 75.25 +/- 22.1 min, n = 4). Low hemoglobin oxygen saturation (mean = 86.7%) was recorded in three cases under ketamine anesthesia, and oxygen insufflation is therefore recommended to prevent hypoxemia. Gorillas induced with tiletamine/zolazepam had significantly higher respiratory rates compared with animals given ketamine. Successful anesthesia and recovery, in particular, depended on the assistance of local personnel."

Evolution of alpha 2-fucosyltransferase genes in primates: Relation between an intronic Alu-Y element and red cell expression of ABH antigens,"['Apoil, PA', 'Roubinet, F', 'Despiau, S', 'Mollicone, R', 'Oriol, R', 'Blancher, A']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,MAR 2000,27,"Coding sequences of the paralogous FUT1 (H), FUT2 (Se), and Sec1 alpha 2-fucosyltransferase genes were obtained from different primate species. Analysis of the primate FUT1-like and FUT2 like sequences revealed the absence of the known human inactivating mutations giving rise to the h null alleles of FUT1 and the se null alleles of FUT2. Therefore, most primate FUT1-like and FUT2-like genes potentially code for functional enzymes. The Sec1-like gene encodes for a potentially functional alpha 2-fucosyltransferase enzyme in nonprimate mammals, New World monkeys, and Old World monkeys, but it has been inactivated by a nonsense mutation at codon 325 in the ancestor of humans and African apes (gorillas, chimpanzees). Human and gorilla Sec1's have, in addition, two deletions and one insertion, respectively, 5' of the nonsense mutation leading to proteins shorter than chimpanzee Sec1. Phylogenetic analysis of the available H, Se, and Sec1 mammalian protein sequences demonstrates the existence of three clusters which correspond to the three genes. This suggests that the differentiation of the three genes is rather old and predates the great mammalian radiation. The phylogenetic analysis also suggests that Sec1 has a higher evolutionary rate than FUR and FUT1. Finally, we show that an Alu-Y element was inserted in intron 1 of the FUT1 ancestor of humans and apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons); this Alu-Y element has not been found in monkeys or nonprimate mammals, which lack ABH antigens on red cells. A potential mechanism leading to the red cell expression of the H enzyme in primates, related to the insertion of this Alu-Y sequence, is proposed."
Evolutionary origins of human alcoholism in primate frugivory,"['Dudley, R']",QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY,10.1086/393255,MAR 2000,48,"Evolutionary origins of alcohol consumption have rarely been considered in studies of ethanol addiction. However, the occurrence of ethanol in ripe and decaying fruit and the substantial heritability of alcoholism in humans suggest an important historical association between primate frugivory and alcohol consumption. Olfactory localization of ripe fruit via volatilized alcohols, the use of ethanol as an appetitive stimulant, and the consumption of fruits with substantial ethanol content potentially characterize all frugivorous primates, including hominoids and the lineage leading to modem humans. Patterns of alcohol use by humans in contemporary environments nay thus reflect a maladaptive co-option of ancestral nutritional strategies. Although diverse factors contribute to the expression of alcoholism as a clinical syndrome, historical selection for the consumption of ethanol in the course of frugivory can be viewed as a subtle get pervasive evolutionary influence on modern humans."
Evidence supporting the requirement for two proline residues for expression of c,"['Westhoff, CM', 'Silberstein, LE', 'Wylie, DE']",TRANSFUSION,10.1046/j.1537-2995.2000.40030321.x,MAR 2000,16,"BACKGROUND: In humans, c antigen expression is associated with a proline residue at amino acid position 103 in the second extracellular loop of the CE protein. Comparison of nonhuman primate Rh proteins suggested that c reactivity might actually involve two proline residues. It has been shown that the RBCs of New World capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) react with anti-c. To further define the amino acid residues involved in c expression, Rh cDNA from the capuchin was analyzed.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Rh transcripts were amplified by reverse transcription PCR from RNA isolated from the reticulocytes of a capuchin monkey and were cloned and sequenced.

RESULTS: Rh transcripts from the capuchin monkey, whose RBCs react with anti-c, were found to encode adjacent proline residues at 102 and 103.

CONCLUSION: Sequencing of Rh transcripts from the capuchin monkey supports the hypothesis that the expression of c requires two adjacent proline residues. Proline causes bends or loops in proteins, which, in this case, might form a unique, stable structure resistant to perturbations induced by changes in upstream or downstream residues. This would explain the scarcity in humans of c variants as compared to the other major Rh antigen variants, and the preservation of c reactivity despite 24-percent divergence between the human and capuchin Rh proteins."
"Cloning of serotonin 5-HT1 receptor subtypes from the chimpanzee, gorilla and Rhesus monkey and their agonist-induced guanosine 5'gamma S-35 triphosphate binding","['Alberts, GL', 'Pregenzer, JF', 'Im, WB', 'Slightom, JL']",NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS,10.1016/S0304-3940(00)00788-6,FEB 25 2000,10,"5-HT1 receptor subtypes ((1B), (1D) and (1F)) have been implicated in migraine pathophysiology and their ligands have been examined for pharmacological actions in various experimental animal models. Considerable divergences exist, however, in their primary sequences between experimental animals and human, and additional models closer to human, such as non-human primates seem to be useful for migraine research. Earlier, we cloned the 5-HT1D, and here 5-HT1B and 5-HT1F receptors from the chimpanzee, gorilla and Rhesus monkey, via polymerase chain reactions with their genomic DNAs and primers designed from the corresponding human receptors. Direct sequencing of PCR products showed that the 5-HT1B receptors from the chimpanzee, gorilla and monkey differ from the human receptor by 0, 1 and 7 residues, respectively while 5-HT1F receptors differ by 0, 3 and 10 residues, respectively. These divergent residues are mostly conservatively substituted and also largely confined to the N-terminal region and the 3rd intracellular loop, away from transmembrane segments and intracellular loops near membrane which are critical for ligand binding and G protein coupling. The chimpanzee 5-HT1D, 5-HT1B and monkey 5-HT1F receptors, as heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, showed robust agonist-induced guanosine 5'gamma S-35 triphosphate (GTP gamma(35)S) binding through activation of G proteins containing G gamma(i) subunits. Moreover, pronounced inhibition of basal GTP gamma(35)S binding by methiothepin (an antagonist), representing constitutively active receptors, was observed with only 5-HT1D. Overall, ligand binding and GTP gamma(35)S binding profiles for these primate receptors are comparable to those for the human receptors and validate non-human primates as useful models for human migraine research.

Identification of hepatitis B virus indigenous to chimpanzees,"['Hu, XL', 'Margolis, HS', 'Purcell, RH', 'Ebert, J', 'Robertson, BH']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.97.4.1661,FEB 15 2000,69,"Hepatitis B viruses (HBV) and related viruses, classified in the Hepadnaviridae family, are found in a wide variety of mammals and birds. Although the chimpanzee has been the primary experimental model of HBV infection, this species has not been considered a natural host for the virus. Retrospective analysis of 13 predominantly wild-caught chimpanzees with chronic HBV infection identified a unique chimpanzee HBV strain in 11 animals. Nucleotide and derived amino acid analysis of the complete HBV genome and the gene coding for the hepatitis B surface antigen (S gene) identified sequence patterns that could be used to reliably identify chimpanzee HBV. This analysis indicated that chimpanzee HBV is distinct from known human HBV genotypes and is closely related to HBVs previously isolated from a chimpanzee, gibbons, gorillas, and orangutans."
Taxonomic and functional aspects of the patterning of enamel thickness distribution in extant large-bodied hominoids,"['Schwartz, GT']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(200002)111:2<221::AID-AJPA8>3.0.CO;2-G,FEB 2000,91,"One of the few uncontested viewpoints in studies of enamel thickness is that the molars of the African apes, Pan and Gorilla, possess ""thin"" enamel, while Pongo and modern humans possess varying degrees of ""thick"" enamel, even when interspecific differences in overall body or tooth size are taken into account. Such studies focus primarily on estimates of the total volume of enamel relative to tooth size (i.e., ""relative"" enamel thickness), as this is thought to bear directly on questions concerning dietary proclivities and phylogenetic relationships. Only recently have studies shifted focus to examining differences in the distribution of enamel across the tooth crown, i.e., the patterning of enamel thickness, as this may contribute to more refined models of tooth function and dietary adaptations in extant hominoids. Additionally, this feature has been suggested to be a reliable indicator of taxonomic affinity in early hominins, though no study has specifically addressed whether species-specific patterns exist among known phena.

The aims of this paper were to test more explicitly whether enamel thickness patterning provides valuable taxonomic, functional, and/or phylogenetic information for maxillary molars of large-bodied extant hominoids. A series of seven linear enamel thickness measurements was recorded in the plane of the mesial cusps in cross sections of a total of 62 maxillary molars of P. troglodytes, G. gorilla, P. pygmaeus, and H. sapiens to estimate the patterning of enamel thickness distribution. Results from a discriminant function analysis reveal that, overall, this trait reclassifies extant hominoid maxillary molars with 90% accuracy: 100% of extant Homo, 75.0% of Pongo, 83.3% of Pan, and 66.7% of Gorilla ale reclassified correctly, indicating that this feature possesses a strong taxonomic signal. Furthermore, differences in the structure of the enamel cap are evident among hominoids: modern humans differ from Pongo in possessing proportionally thicker enamel in areas of the crown associated with shearing activity; Pan molars are better designed than those of Gorilla for generating a greater component of crushing/grinding loads. Thus, African ape molars are structurally dissimilar, even though they are both considered to belong to a morphologically homogeneous ""thin-enameled"" group. Simple developmental mechanisms can be invoked to explain the sometimes subtle differences in the achievement of adult morphology. For instance, human and orangutan molar cusps possess a similar degree of enamel thickness, but the possibility exists that despite similarities in morphology, each species follows a different sequence of secretory activity of enamel to achieve the final, albeit similar, degree of enamel thickness. Such a finding would suggest that the shared possession of ""thick"" or ""thin"" enamel among species may be phylogenetically uninformative, as it would not represent a developmental synapomorphy.

Each hybrid has been characterized cytogenetically by FISH and molecularly by 37 STSs, evenly spaced along the chromosome. The panel can be exploited to map subregionally DNA sequences on chromosome 4 and to generate partial chromosome paints useful in the characterization of chromosomal rearrangements involving this chromosome. Furthermore, a panel of 84 YACs mapping on chromosome 4 has been characterized by FISH. A subset of this panel is recognized by STSs used in the somatic cell hybrid characterization. In this way a correlation between the genetic and the physical maps can be established. These resources have been used to investigate the conservation of the phylogenetic chromosome IV in great apes. The results indicate that all the pericentric inversions that differentiate chromosome TV in these species are distinct and that one of the breakpoints frequently lies very close to the centromere. In 4 instances, the YAC containing the breakpoint was identified. The breakpoint in IVq of PTR and MMU lies in the same YAC, suggesting that this breakpoint has been utilized twice in the evolutionary history of this chromosome. (C) 2000 Academic Press."
The brain and its main anatomical subdivisions in living hominoids using magnetic resonance imaging,"['Semendeferi, K', 'Damasio, H']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1999.0381,FEB 2000,118,"Primary comparative data on the hominoid brain are scarce and major neuroanatomical differences between humans and apes have not yet been described satisfactorily, even at the gross level. Basic questions that involve the evolution of the human brain cannot be addressed adequately unless the brains of all extant hominoid species are analyzed. Contrary to the scarcity of original data, there is a rich literature on the topic of human brain evolution and several debates exist on the size of particular sectors of the brain, e.g., the frontal lobe.

In this study we applied a non-invasive imaging technique (magnetic resonance) on living human, great ape and lesser ape subjects in order to investigate the overall size of the hominoid brain. The images were reconstructed in three dimensions and volumetric estimates were obtained for the brain and its main anatomical sectors, including the frontal and temporal lobes, the insula, the parieto-occipital sector and the cerebellum.

A remarkable homogeneity is present in the relative size of many of the large sectors of the hominoid brain, but interspecific and intraspecific variation exists in certain parts of the brain. The human cerebellum is smaller than expected for an ape brain of human size. It is suggested that the cerebellum increased less than the cerebrum after the split of the human lineage from the African ancestral hominoid stock. In contrast, humans have a slightly larger temporal lobe and insula than expected, but differences are not statistically significant.

Humans do not have a larger frontal lobe than expected for an ape brain of human size and gibbons have a relatively smaller frontal lobe than the rest of the hominoids. Given the fact that the frontal lobe in humans and great apes has similar relative size, it is parsimonious to suggest that the relative size of the whole of the frontal lobe has not changed significantly during hominid evolution in the Plio-Pleistocene.

DNA archives and our nearest relative: The trichotomy problem revisited,"['Satta, Y', 'Klein, J', 'Takahata, N']",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1006/mpev.2000.0704,FEB 2000,95,"Ever since Thomas H. Huxley correctly identified the chimpanzee and the gorilla as the two closest relatives of the human, the problem of the relationship among the three species (""the trichotomy problem"") has remained unresolved. Comparative morphology and other classical methods of biological investigation have failed to answer definitively whether the chimpanzee or the gorilla is the closest relative of the human species. DNA sequences, both mitochondrial and nuclear, too, have provided equivocal solutions, depending on the region of the genome analyzed. Random sorting of ancestral allelic lineages, sequence convergence, and sequence exchanges between alleles or duplicated loci have been identified as likely factors confounding the interpretation of the interrelationships among the three species, In the present study most of these difficulties are overcome by identifying evolutionary causes that might potentially provide misleading information. Altogether, 45 loci consisting of 46,855 bp are analyzed. About 60% of the loci and approximately the same proportion of phylogenetically informative sites support the human-chimpanzee clade, The remaining 40% of loci and sites support the two alternatives equally. It is demonstrated that, while incompatibility between loci can, be explained by random sorting of allelic Lineages, incompatibility within loci must be attributed largely to the joint effect of recombination and genetic drift. The trichotomy problem can be properly addressed only within this framework. (C) 2000 Academic Press."
Full-genome sequence analyses of hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains recovered from chimpanzees infected in the wild: Implications for an origin of HBV,"['Takahashi, K', 'Brotman, B', 'Usuda, S', 'Mishiro, S', 'Prince, AM']",VIROLOGY,10.1006/viro.1999.0102,FEB 1 2000,76,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) belongs to the genus Orthohepadnavirus of the family Hepadnaviridae. Having been found in various animals (duck, heron, woodchuck, ground squirrel, and primates), hepadnaviruses must have undergone a long history of evolution and may comprise more members than currently recognized. Chimpanzees may also have their own hepadnavirus, even if it might be very close to HBV. We analyzed HBV-like sequences from three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) that were most likely infected during their life in Africa in the wild. Two chimpanzees (Ch256 and Ch258) possessed a viral genome of 3182 nt in length with a 33-nt deletion in the preS1 region; which could not be classified into any of the six genotypes (A-F) of human HBV but was very homologous to a previously reported isolate from a London Zoo chimpanzee. Phylogenetically distinct from the HBV-like sequences from gibbons, orangutans, and a gorilla so far reported, the Ch256 and Ch258 isolates would represent an indigenous chimpanzee HBV (tentatively ChHBV). A third chimpanzee (Ch195) had a 3212-nt genome, classifiable into the genotype E of HBV. Because HBV-E has been found mostly in Africans, Ch195 may have been Infected from a human source in Africa. However, an inverse scenario is also possible: a spread of HBV-E might have occurred from chimpanzees to humans a long time ago in Africa. Analysis of the arginine-rich C-terminal region of the core protein, which is well conserved among mammalian hepadnaviruses, indicated that HBV-E/F and nonhuman primate hepadnaviruses are much closer than HBV-A/B/C/D to the hepadnaviruses of woodchuck and ground squirrel. Our results support an ""ex-nonhuman primate"" hypothesis for the origin of HBV. (C) 2000 Academic Press."
Rapid evolution of male reproductive genes in the descent of man,"['Wyckoff, GJ', 'Wang, W', 'Wu, CI']",NATURE,NA,JAN 20 2000,368,"A diverse body of morphological and genetic evidence has suggested that traits pertaining to male reproduction may have evolved much more rapidly than other types of character(1-3). Recently, DNA sequence comparisons have also shown a very high level of divergence in male reproductive proteins between closely related Drosophila species(4-6), among marine invertebrates(7,8) and between mouse and rat(9). Here we show that rapid evolution of male reproductive genes is observable in primates and is quite notable in the lineages to human and chimpanzee. Nevertheless, rapid evolution by itself is not necessarily an indication of positive darwinian selection; relaxation of negative selection is often equally compatible with the DNA sequence data. By taking three statistical approaches, we show that positive darwinian selection is often the driving force behind this rapid evolution. These results open up opportunities to test the hypothesis that sexual selection plays some role in the molecular evolution of higher primates."
The Great Ape Project. Equality beyond humanity.,"['Scharmann, W']",ALTEX-ALTERNATIVEN ZU TIEREXPERIMENTEN,NA,2000,5,"The Great Ape Project (GAP) is an appeal of 36 scientist from different disciplines aiming at the legal equalisation of the non-human great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans) with man. The appeal is expressed by a number of essays stating zoological, genetical, ethological, anthropological, ethical and psychological knowledge and, based on these arguments, demanding the abolition of the species barrier between human beings and great apes.

The central point of the initiative is the ""Declaration on Great Apes"", claiming the inclusion of great apes in the ""community of equals"" and thus securing three basic rights for all great apes: 1. The Right of Life: 2. The Protection of Individual Liberty; 3. The Prohibition of Torture.

Not only experiments with great apes and their their capture from the wilderness will be banned, but it is also intended to enfranchise as many great apes as possible from research laboratories and zoos. As a legal basis fr the achievement of basic rights most of the authors plead for the idea of conferring the moral status of person"" on great apes.

Criticism of the GAP is due to anthropocentrism. Rejection is especially expressed by advocates of pathocentric ethics who argue that the species barriers will not be abolished but only shifted, running then between the great apes and the remaining living beings.

However the GAP resulted in a greater retention in the use of apes for experiments in several; industrial countries.

Additionally, the popular literature published by ethologists in the passed decades has supported a more responsible attitude of the public towards primates.

Despite of all efforts the survival of the great apes is greatly endangered within their native countries."

Back to the roots of a new exon - The molecular archaeology of a SP100 splice variant,"['Rogalla, P', 'Kazmierczak, B', 'Flohr, AM', 'Hauke, S', 'Bullerdiek, J']",GENOMICS,10.1006/geno.1999.6008,JAN 1 2000,26,"Retropseudogenes are intronless DNA sequences sharing a high degree of homology with the cDNA of their corresponding active genes. They are thought to have originated by reverse transcription of messenger RNA and reintegration of the cDNA into the genome. Usually considered a type of evolutionary waste, they melt into the background of their surrounding DNA by the loss of similarity to the active gene or disappear from the genome by the accumulation of deletions. On the other hand, in this paper we describe the evolutionary recycling of this genomic waste. Recently, a splice variant of the gene encoding the nuclear protein SP100 was identified in which the 3' part of the cDNA is replaced by an alternative exon apparently encoding an HMG1-DNA-binding domain. We were able to show that this HMG box is contributed by a new exon arising from an HMG1 retropseudogene that we have molecularly characterized in detail. In addition to being found in human cells, corresponding fusion transcripts were shown in Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and Hylobates lar, but not in Macaca mulatta, Genomic DNA from M. mulatta enabled us to amplify by PCR the 5' part but not the 3' part of the HMG1 retropseudogene. From our data we thus can date the underlying retrotransposition to more than 35 million years ago. Our findings offer a model as to how new exons may evolve during evolution. To our knowledge this is the first example of a retropseudogene becoming part of an active gene in which both parental parts are well characterized and remain in-frame with their cDNA.

Molecular structure and evolution of an alpha satellite non-alpha satellite junction at 16p11,"['Horvath, JE', 'Viggiano, L', 'Loftus, BJ', 'Adams, MD', 'Archidiacono, N', 'Rocchi, M', 'Eichler, EE']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/9.1.113,JAN 1 2000,76,"We have determined the detailed molecular structure and evolution of an alpha satellite junction from human chromosome 16p11. The analysis reveals that the alpha satellite sequence bordering the transition tacks higher-order structure and that the non-alpha satellite portion consists of a mosaic of duplicated segments of complex evolutionary origin. The 16p11 junction was formed recently (5-10 million years ago) by the duplication and transposition of genomic segments from Xq28 and 4q24, Once this mosaic structure was formed, a larger complex was spread among multiple pericentromeric regions. This resulted in the formation of large (>62 kb) paralogous segments that share a high degree (similar to 97%) of sequence similarity. Both phylogenetic and comparative analyses indicate that these pericentromeric-directed duplications occurred around the time of the divergence of the human, gorilla and chimpanzee lineages, resulting in the subtle restructuring of the primate genome among these species. The available data suggest that such chimeric structures are a general property of several different human chromosomes near their alpha satellite junctions."

Regeneration of an Afromontane forest following gricultural encroachment in southwestern Uganda,"['Lejju, JB', 'Oryem-Origa, H', 'Kasenene, JM']",ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES,NA,2000,0,"A study of the regeneration of an Afromontane forest was carried out in Mgahinga Gorilla National Park (MGNP), southwestern Uganda, following agricultural encroachment in the last 50 years. The landscape was changed by terracing and removing the indigenous vegetation and replacing it with exotic tree species. This study also examined the soil nutrient status of the formerly encroached area in the park.

Species richness of indigenous trees was high in the formerly cultivated area. Twenty-six indigenous species were found in the formerly cultivated area, compared with 20 species in the natural forest and 12 species of indigenous trees found under exotic woodlots. There was a significant difference in species richness acid density in the three habitat types. The natural forest supported the highest stem density (75%), and the lowest stem density (4%) was recorded under exotic woodlots. Seedlings (<2 cm diameter at breast height) accounted for the majority of juveniles in the three habitats. The natural forest had the highest density (24,625 seedlings/ha), and exotic woodlots supported the lowest stem density (1,350 seedlings/ha).

The level of regeneration in the formerly encroached area is influenced by the intensity of cultivation and soil nutrients. The advanced growth beneath the exotic woodlots, especially black wattle (Acacin mearnsii) and Eucalyptus sp. stands, is relatively impoverished. This condition beneath the exotic species suggests that a low diverse community of native species is able to exploit this environment."
The evolution of homoerotic behavior in humans,"['Muscarella, F']",JOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY,10.1300/J082v40n01_03,2000,24,"This paper presents a theoretical model for the evolution of same-sex sexual behavior, or homoerotic behavior, in humans. Contrary to the traditional study of the topic, the emphasis is on homoerotic behavior itself; irrespective of sexual orientation. It is an inferential model drawn from cross-species evidence, cross-cultural evidence, and current evolutionary theory. It is posited that humans evolved a disposition for homoerotic behavior because it increased same-sex affiliation among peripheralized hominids and indirectly influenced rates of survival and reproductive success. The implications for the conceptualization of same-sex sexual behavior and future research are indicated."
Ph gene evolution in primates: Study of intron sequences,"['Apoil, PA', 'Blancher, A']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,JAN 2000,7,"By amplification and sequencing of RH gene intron 4 of various primates we demonstrate that an Alu-Sx-like element has been inserted in the RH gene of the common ancestor of humans, apes, Old World monkeys, and New World monkeys. The study of mouse and lemur intron 4 sequences allowed us to precisely define the insertion point of the Alu-Sx element in intron 4 of the RH gene ancestor common to Anthropoidea. Like humans, chimpanzees and gorillas possess two types of RH intron 4, characterized by the presence (human RHCE and ape RHCE-like genes) or absence (human RHD and ape RHD-like genes) of the Alu-Sx element. This led us to conclude that in the RH common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, a duplication of the common ancestor gene gave rise to two genes, one differing from the other by a 654-bp deletion encompassing an Alu-Sx element. Moreover, most of chimpanzees and some gorillas possess two types of RHD-like intron 4. The introns 4 of type 1 have a length similar to that of human RHD intron 4, whereas introns 4 of type 2 display an insertion of 12 bp. The latest insertion was not found in the human genome (72 individuals tested). The study of RH intron 3 length polymorphism confirmed that, Like humans, chimpanzees and gorillas possess two types of intron 3, with the RHD-type intron 3 being 289 bases shorter than the RHCE intron 3. By amplification and sequencing of regions encompassing introns 3 and 4, we demonstrated that chimpanzee and gorilla RH-like genes displayed associations of introns 3 and 4 distinct to those found in man. Altogether, the results demonstrate that, as in humans, chimpanzee and gorilla RH genes experienced intergenic exchanges."
"Preliminary assessment of the impacts of human activities on gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla and other wildlife at Dzanga-Sangha Reserve, Central African Republic","['Remis, MJ']",ORYX,10.1046/j.1365-3008.2000.00091.x,JAN 2000,36,"The aim of this study was to make preliminary assessments of the effects of human activities on the gorillas and other wildlife in the Dzanga-Ndoki Park and broader Dzanga-Sangha Dense Forest Reserve (RDS), Central African Republic. During a month-long sun ev in 1997, observation and sign of humans and large mammals, including ape nest-sites, were recorded on 81.2 km of line transects in three sectors of the park and reserve. Human activities. including intensities of lugging and hunting, appeared to decrease with distance from the population centres and were lower an the park than in the reserve sectors. Encounter rates with sign of duikers Cephalophus spp., monkeys Cercopithecus spy. and Cercocebus albigena, elephants Loxodonta africana, and gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla were generally Ion er in regions of high human activity in the reserve than in the park sectors. Nevertheless, gorilla nest-site densities did not vary significantly between sectors or with human activity levels. A high frequency of zero (bare ground) nests at RES suggests that gorilla surveys that rely on line transect methods and use nest decomposition rates from other studies may sometimes underestimate gorilla densities. This study suggests that current levels of exploitation in managed hunting zones of national forest reserves may be negatively affecting targeted wildlife populations in these zones. Assessments should be a regular part of efforts to monitor the health of wildlife populations in managed protected zones. Participation by Central Africans in research will continue to benefit conservation and development efforts."

A case study of mother-son transfer in mountain gorillas,"['Sicotte, P']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557465,JAN 2000,11,"In mountain gorillas (Gorilla g. beringei), male immigration in bi-sexual units is rare. This paper presents the case of a nearly weaned male infant gorilla who followed his mother in her transfer. This case was recorded in the study population at the Karisoke Research Center in 1988. The data come from observation in Group B (on 12 days just prior to the transfer and on 54 days after the transfer over a period of 6 months). The situation of the infant did match the conditions in which infanticide occurs in gorillas, but he was not killed, despite receiving male aggression and being wounded twice. In fact, both the mother and the infant received male aggression more frequently than the long term residents in the group. The aggression received by the mother decreased after she mated with the males and after she weaned the infant. The aggression received by the infant, however, did not decrease after his mother mated with the males, and increased in intensity. The infant reacted fearfully to male aggression, in marked contrast to his mother, who reacted either with indifference or by simply avoiding the males. The aggression eventually stopped, and the infant became a blackback in Group B. Evolutionarily, the death of the infant would not have markedly accelerated the mother's return to estrus, but the death of the infant could still have benefitted the males, by decreasing the reproductive output of a competitor. Adult male gorillas are also presumably selected to resist male immigration. Proximately, the aggression directed towards the infant was not related to mating access to the mother. The sex of the infant may contribute to explain the post-transfer male aggression, but data on the integration of old female infants in a new group is needed to test whether the sex of the infant has an effect on their vulnerability to infanticide. Also, the intense fear displayed by the infant may have played a role in prompting male aggression."
Orangutan use of vertical space in an innovative habitat,"['Hebert, PL', 'Bard, KA']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/1098-2361(2000)19:4<239::AID-ZOO2>3.0.CO;2-7,2000,9,"This study measured use of vertical space in an innovative habitat for three adolescent orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus). The indoor habitat was innovative in two main ways: a flooded floor and retractable skylights. It included four large molded trees and interwoven vines throughout 1,620 m(3) of space. The exhibit was divided into four vertical levels: skylights, upper canopy, lower canopy, and flooded floor. Five trained observers made instantaneous scans of the exhibit every 5 minutes, in 1-hour blocks of time over a 10-month period, logging 180 hours of observations. One location (of 55) and one behavior (of 53) were noted at each interval. Behaviors were collapsed to form five categories: solitary inactivity, solitary activity, social inactivity, social activity, and eating/drinking. Results showed the orangutans favored the upper canopy, which contained many tree limbs for sitting and reclining. The orangutans next favored the lower canopy and the skylights, especially those skylights that were out of public view. The habitat's flooded floor was avoided (they used it just 1% of the time), as planned by the exhibit designers who intended to showcase these arboreal primates in trees, not on the ground. When compared with wild orangutans, we considered few of their behaviors to be atypical: foraging/eating plastic (vines) and stereotyped behaviors. Overall, the unique design of the habitat provided opportunities for a range of species-typical behaviors, varying by vertical level, demonstrating the importance of providing sufficient vertical space for orangutans.

Polymorphisms at the DRD4 gene have been examined for association with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders and normal behavioral variation. The DRD4 gene is unusual in its high amount of expressed polymorphism in humans. Here we study the identification of a polymorphic tandem duplication of 120 bp located 1.2 kb upstream of the initiation codon. The duplicated region contains consensus sequences of binding sites for several known transcription factors, suggesting that different alleles may differ in their transcriptional activity. Because chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans lack the duplication, the duplicated allele is inferred to be derived. The frequency of this derived duplication allele ranges from 0.40-0.81 in the 11 populations from around the world typed for this polymorphism, Am. J, Med, Genet. (Neuropsychiatr.

Female dominance relationships among captive western lowland gorillas: Comparisons with the wild,"['Scott, J', 'Lockard, JS']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/156853999500721,DEC 1999,12,"Female dominance relationships were studied among three family groups of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) housed in large enclosures at Howletts Wild Animal Park, in Kent, England. In common with gorillas in their natural habitat, the Howletts gorillas forage throughout the day on low nutrient foods. However, the latter differ, at least from mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei); in that they also have relatively frequent access to high nutrient, high energy novel food items which are patchily distributed in time and space, and defendable. It was predicted that. despite these differences, the Howletts: females: would resemble mountain gorillas in forming adult female dominance hierarchies (determined from supplant interactions) in which older females that have lived in the group the longest are dominant to younger females, more recent to the group. The comparison was made with mountain gorillas as they are the only gorilla subspecies for which such data exist for wild-living populations. As predicted, an age/tenure-based dominance hierarchy was found to be the case for tho je groups at Howletts where there was considerable variation between the females' ages and length of group tenure. As gorillas and chimpanzees resemble more closely each other in forming age/tenure-based dominance hierarchies than they do other female-transfer primate species, it is proposed that the gorilla-chimpanzee pattern may have common phylogenetic origins. In addition, the order of progression of gorillas into their indoor living quarters appears to be a good indicator of supplant-dominance relationships among adult group members. It was also found that. despite bring removed from their natural habitat, dominant males in captivity still lead their groups during group travel in the same manner that do males in the wild: either at the head, or bringing up the rear. Though primate social behaviour may be flexible depending on immediate context and life history variables, this flexibility may well remain within evolutionarily defined parameters, leading to species-typical patterns in general social interactions."

In this paper we report an additional peculiar feature of these regions that we discovered while analyzing, by FISH, the evolutionary conservation of primate phylogenetic chromosome IX. if the position of the centromere is not taken into account, a relatively small number of rearrangements must be invoked to account for interspecific differences. Conversely, if the centromere is included, a paradox emerges: The position of the centromere seems to have undergone, ill some species, an evolutionary history independent From the surrounding markers. A significant number of additional rearrangements must be proposed to reconcile the order of the markers with centromere position. Alternatively, the evolutionary emergence of neocentromeres can be postulated."

Fecal specimens (n = 100) of nonhabituated and human-habituated gorillas (5 populations; 6 age classes) were tested for Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts and Giardia sp. cysts by conventional staining and immunofluorescent antibody (IFA). Cryptosporidium sp. infections (prevalence 11%) were not restricted to very young gorillas but were observed in 3-yr-old to >12-yr-old gorillas most of the infections (73%) occurred in human-habituated gorillas. The prevalence of Giardia sp. infections was 2%; 1 nonhabituated gorilla was concomitantly infected. Oocysts of Cryptosporidium sp. in the gorilla stools were morphologically, morphometrically, and immunologically undistinguishable from a bovine isolate of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. Mean concentration of Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts and Giardia sp. cysts in gorilla stools was 9.39 x 10(4)/g, and 2.49 x 10(4)/g, respectively. There was no apparent relationship between oocyst concentration and gorilla age, sex, or habituation status. Most Cryptosporidium sp. infections found in gorillas with closest proximity to people may be a result of the habituation process and ecotourism. This study constitutes the first report of Cryptosporidium sp. infections in the family Pongidae, in the free-ranging great apes, and in the species of gorilla."

Identifiable C. hepatica eggs were present in the liver of 4 gorillas (3 juveniles, 1 adult), and nematode cross-sections were found in 1 juvenile gorilla. Six other adult gorillas had areas of periportal and subcapsular fibrosis with calcified eggs. Histologically, the lesions surrounded by the areas of mild inflammatory reaction were characterized by subcapsular, periportal foci of fibrosis in which were embedded numerous C. hepatica eggs. Control of hepatic capillariasis in the remaining populations of mountain gorillas should be focused on eradication or control of populations of rodent pests (i.e., mice and rats) that sustain the reservoir of C. hepatica in habitats shared by gorillas and humans."

Thyroid hypofunction could explain the weight gain, unsettled appetite, anxious behavior, lethargy, and poor intraspecies interactions shown by this gorilla. The antibodies in the commercial immunoassay used in this study apparently cross-reacted with gorilla TSH. Supplementation with levothyroxine sodium was initiated and was followed by a marked decrease in circulating TSH and a noticeable improvement in the animal's physiologic status and activity level."

Three polymorphic regions can usefully be defined in the description of these sequences: the dinucleotide GT repeat itself, the anonymous region 5' of this repeat, and a variable CTGT repeat in the 3' region. The 5' sequence displayed six alleles in the individuals studied. One of these alleles was invariably associated with substitutions in the GT repeat and absence of the CTGT repeat, the others with pure, polymorphic GT repeats and variation in the numbers of CTGT repeats. Haplotypes can be classified by the allele in the 5' region. Those carrying allele 1 were only found in man,those with allele 2 in man, chimpanzee and gorilla. The third haplotype (indicated by the presence of allele 3) was found in chimpanzee, gorilla and orang-utan,the fourth in chimpanzee and gibbon, the fifth in baboon, guenon and mangabey and the sixth In guenon and macaque;The alleles in the 5' region, but from different species, are thus often more similar than alleles from the same species, a phenomenon already shown for some HLA genes. This suggests that major histocompatibility sequences and surrounding sequences shared a correlated evolutionary history. The new polymorphic tetranucleotide microsatellite (CTGT, 3rd region) has possibly arisen de novo from the pre-existing dinucleotide GT. This study provides information not only on the molecular evolution of this particular microsatellite but also of the trans-speciation maintenance of polymorphism of its surrounding sequences."

Comparison to humans shows the diversity of the chimpanzee sequences to be almost four times as high and the age of the most recent common ancestor three times as great as the corresponding values of humans. Phylogenetic analyses show the sequences from the different chimpanzee subspecies to be intermixed and the distance between some chimpanzee sequences to be greater than the distance between them and the bonobo sequences."
Enamel hypoplasia in deciduous teeth of great apes: Do differences in defect prevalence imply differential levels of physiological stress?,"['Lukacs, JR']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199911)110:3<351::AID-AJPA7>3.0.CO;2-2,NOV 1999,18,"This paper presents new data on enamel hypoplasia in the deciduous canine teeth of great apes. The enamel defect under consideration is known as localized hypoplasia of primary canines (LHPC), and is characterized by an area of thin or missing enamel on the labial surface of deciduous canine teeth (Skinner [1986a] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 69:59-69). Goals of this study are: 1) to determine if significant differences in the frequency of LHPC occur among three genera of great apes, and 2) to evaluate variation in LHPC prevalence among great apes as evidence of differential physiological stress. Infant and juvenile apes with deciduous teeth were examined at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History (n = 100) and at the Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History (n = 36). Deciduous teeth were observed under oblique incandescent light, with the naked eye and with a 10x hand lens. Enamel hypoplasia was scored using Federation Dentaire International (FDI)-Defects of Dental Enamel (DDE) standards. Hypoplasias were recorded by drawing defect location and size on a dental chart, and by measuring defect size and location with Hellos needlepoint dial calipers.

The prevalence of LHPC is reported by genus and sex, using two approaches: 1) the frequency of affected individuals-those having one or more deciduous canine teeth scored positive for LHPC; and 2) the number of canine teeth scored positive for LHPC as a percentage of all canine teeth observed. Variation in defect size and location will be described elsewhere.

Localized hypoplasia of primary canine teeth was found in 62.5% of 128 individual apes, and in 45.5% of 398 great ape deciduous canines. As in humans, LHPC is the most common form of enamel hypoplasia in deciduous teeth of great apes, while LEH is rare or absent. The distribution and pattern of expression of LHPC in great apes is similar to that described in humans: side differences are not significant, but mandibular canines exhibit the defect two to five times more often than maxillary canine teeth. Differences in LHPC prevalence by sex are small and not significant. Intergeneric differences are large and non-random: chimpanzees (Pan) exhibit a significantly lower frequency of LHPC (22%, n = 50) by individual count, than either the orangutan (Pongo, 88.0%, n = 25) or the gorilla (Gorilla, 88.7%, n = 53). Tooth count prevalences exhibit a similar pattern of variation and are also statistically significant. These findings suggest that large bodied great apes (gorilla and orangutan) may be under greater physiological stress during perinatal and early postnatal development than the chimpanzee. The size, position, and timing of LHPC lesions are currently under analysis and may yield more insight into the etiological origin of this enamel defect. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

However hairs contain extremely small quantities of DNA, making the method used to extract the DNA of paramount importance. This study compares the effectiveness of 4 different methods of DNA extraction from shed chimpanzee hair, as measured by the ability to amplify mtDNA targets using PCR. The most successful method is also the simplest, requiring only digestion of the root end in a buffer compatible with subsequent PCR without a prior purification or extraction step. Strategies to non-specifically preamplify the template are not successful with DNA from stored shed hairs."

We also report on the age of the CEL pseudogene.

The gorilla CEL gene is 10.5 kb long and comprises 11 exons intervened by introns similar to the situation in man, mouse and rat. The encoded protein is 998 amino acids long and includes a 23 amino acid-long leader peptide. Comparison of the coding sequence, excluding exon 11, of CEL from gorilla and man reveals a 97% similarity. Exon 11, which encodes the characteristic proline rich repeats, contains 39 repeated units in gorilla compared to 16 in man. A truncated CEL pseudogene, with the same organization as that found in man, is also shown to be present in the gorilla genome. The gorilla CEL pseudogene is 4.9 kb in length and consists of 5 exons interrupted by introns. Southern analysis of the gorilla CEL locus shows that the locus is arranged in a similar way as in man with the functional CEL gene being the most 5' one.

To bring further insight to the events involved in the rearrangement of the CEL locus, genomic Southern analyses were performed across several primates; Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus and Macaca arctoides. Results presented show that the CEL gene duplication occurred prior to the separation of Hominidae (man, chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan) from Old World monkeys (macaque). The deletion of the original CEL gene giving rise to the truncated version of the CEL gene seems, however, to be restricted to man and the great apes only. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Adult mandibles of Pan troglodytes troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus and Gorilla gorilla gorilla and from 2 modern human populations (Zulu and Europeans from Spitalfields) were reliably sexed. Thirteen measurements were defined and included mandibular height, length and breadth in representative positions. Univariate statistical techniques and multivariate (principal component analysis and discriminant analysis) statistical techniques were used to investigate interspecific variability and sexual dimorphism in human and great ape mandibles, and intraspecific variability among the modern human mandibles. Analysis of interspecific differences revealed some pairs of variables with a tight linear relationship and others where Homo and the great apes pulled apart from one another due to shape differences. Homo and Pan are least sexually dimorphic in the mandible, Pan less so than Homo sapiens, but both the magnitude of sexual dimorphism and the distribution of sexually dimorphic measurements varied both among and between modern humans and great apes. Intraspecific variation among the 10 populations of modern humans was less than that generally reported in studies of crania (74.3% of mandibles were correctly classified into 1 of 10 populations using discriminant functions based on 13 variables as compared with 93% of crania from 17 populations based on 70 variables in one extensive study of crania). A subrecent European population (Poundbury) emerged as more different from a recent European population (Spitalfields) than other more diverse modern populations were from each other, suggesting considerable morphological plasticity in the mandible through time. This study forms a sound basis on which to explore mandibular variation in Neanderthals, early Homo sapiens and other more ancient fossil hominids."
Sequential loss of two neighboring exons of the tropoelastin gene during primate evolution,"['Szabo, Z', 'Levi-Minzi, SA', 'Christiano, AM', 'Struminger, C', 'Stoneking, M', 'Batzer, MA', 'Boyd, CD']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/PL00006587,NOV 1999,41,"Previous evidence has demonstrated the absence of exons 34 and 35 within the 3' end of the human tropoelastin (ELN) gene. These exons encode conserved polypeptide domains within tropoelastin and are found. in the ELN gene in vertebrate species ranging from chickens to rats to cows. We have analyzed the ELN gene in a variety of primate species to determine whether the absence of exons 34 and 35 in humans either is due to allelic variation within the human population or is a general characteristic of the Primates order. An analysis of the 3' end of the ELN gene in several nonhuman primates and in 546 chromosomes from humans of varying ethnic background demonstrated a sequential loss of exons 34 and 35 during primate evolution. The loss of exon 35 occurred at least 35-45 million years ago, when Catarrhines diverged from Platyrrhines (New World monkeys). Exon 34 loss, in contrast, occurred only about: 6-8 million years ago, when Homo separated from the common ancestor shared with chimpanzees and gorillas. Loss of both exons was probably facilitated by Alu-mediated recombination events and possibly conferred a functional evolutionary advantage in elastic tissue."
Phylogenetic analysis of a retroposon family in African great apes,"['Kim, HS', 'Wadekar, RV', 'Takenaka, O', 'Hyun, BH', 'Crow, TJ']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/PL00000083,NOV 1999,10,"The SINE-R retroposon family has been identified by its relationship with the long terminal ret peats (LTRs) of human endogenous retrovirus class K (HERV-K) as a mobile element that has evolved recently in the human genome. Here we examined the recent evolutionary history of this class of elements by a:PCF: approach to genomic DNA from the African great apes and by phylogenetic analysis including comparison with the HERV K10 parent sequence. With primers derived from a cDNA sequence from human brain, we identified 27 sequences from the chimpanzee and 16 from the gorilla. Phylogenetic comparisons with previously recognized sequences from the human and from the orangutan and gibbon revealed wide overlap of elements across species, suggesting multiple origins in the course of hominoid evolution. Two human elements SINE-R.C2 and HS307 were the furthest removed from the HERV-K10 sequence but these two elements were closely related to three elements from the chimpanzee and four elements from the gorilla. This group of elements (our clusters 14 and 15) appears to have transposed late in hominoid evolution. One element (Ch-M16) showed 99.1% sequence identity with the SLNE-R.C2 element, which is human-specific. Thus the SINE-R family appears to have continued to be active in transposition throughout the course of primate evolution."

What it will take to monitor forest elephant populations,"['Walsh, PD', 'White, LJT']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.98148.x,OCT 1999,58,"The decision by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to condition a limited sale of ivory on the status of elephant poaching has brought into sharp focus the technical, organizational, and financial challenges inherent in setting up a continent-wide monitoring program. The task will be particularly arduous in central Africa, where forest elephant populations are difficult to monitor and the infrastructure necessary for population monitoring is lacking. The magnitude of effort that will be necessary is illustrated by an elephant survey done in the Gamba Complex, a network of protected areas on the southwest coast of Gabon. Implementing the survey required a large-scale program for training Gabonese nationals in field survey and analysis methods necessary for elephant monitoring. Field work carried out during the training program suggests that a combination of reconnaissance and line transects can product statistically valid population estimates for a substantially lower effort than line transects alone. We illustrate statistical frameworks for comparing the efficiency of alternative sampling methods, and we analyze the sensitivity of current survey methods, which can detect abundance changes on the order of 15% given fairly high effort levels. Although these training and methodological results are encouraging, they are just small steps in a complex and ongoing process. We argue that this process has many parallels with what needs to be done if the international conservation community is to respond to the challenge set for it by the 1997 CITES meeting. There must be a concerted effort focused both on improving survey methods and on developing the human resources and on-the-ground infrastructure necessary to implement these methods."

Unexpectedly, only cells containing no mtDNA could be repopulated with nonhuman ape mtDNA. Cells containing a defective human mtDNA did not incorporate or maintain ape mtDNA and, therefore died under selection for oxidative phosphorylation function. On the other hand, foreign human mtDNA was readily incorporated and maintained in these cells. The suicidal preference for self-mtDNA showed that functional parameters associated with oxidative phosphorylation are less relevant to mtDNA maintenance and copy number control than recognition of mtDNA self-determinants. Non-self-mtDNA could not be maintained into cells with mtDNA even if no selection for oxidative phosphorylation was applied. The repopulation kinetics of several mtDNA forms after severe depletion by ethidium bromide treatment showed that replication and maintenance of mtDNA in human cells are highly dependent on molecular features, because partially deleted mtDNA molecules repopulated cells significantly faster than full-length mtDNA. Taken together, our results suggest that mtDNA copy number may be controlled by competition for limiting levels of trans-acting factors that recognize primarily mtDNA molecular features. In agreement with this hypothesis, marked variations in mtDNA levels did not affect the transcription of nuclear-coded factors involved in mtDNA replication."
A potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody can discriminate amongst IFN gamma from various primates with greater specificity than can the human IFN gamma receptor complex,"['Thakur, AB', 'Landolfi, NF']",MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY,10.1016/S0161-5890(99)00096-6,OCT-NOV 1999,7,"A monoclonal antibody (AF2) generated against recombinant human interferon gamma (IFN gamma) exhibited potent IFN gamma neutralizing activity and prevented human IFN gamma from binding to the cell surface IFN gamma receptor complex. The AF2 antibody also neutralized IFN gamma from higher primates (superfamily Hominoidea) but did not react with IFN gamma from rhesus or other primates in the suborder Anthropoidea. IFN gamma from all primates tested, however, could signal via the human IFN gamma, receptor complex, as indicated by the ability to upregulate the level of MHC class II molecule expression on the surface of a responsive human cell line. We cloned and sequenced the IFN gamma gene from chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon, and compared those with the previously reported IFN gamma sequences of human, rhesus, baboon and marmoset. This comparison revealed that, of the primate IFN gamma s that were not reactive with AF2, rhesus IFN gamma was most homologous to human IFN gamma, differing at only nine amino acids and containing a one amino acid deletion. Comparing the sequence of human IFN gamma, with that of rhesus IFN gamma suggested residues of the human IFN gamma molecule that were involved in the formation of the epitope recognized by the AF2 antibody. Constructing human/rhesus chimeric IFN gamma molecules, combined with site-directed mutagenesis of both human and rhesus IFN gamma revealed that this epitope was dependent upon two non-contiguous amino acids that are juxtaposed in the tertiary structure of IFN gamma. The determinant recognized by AF2 antibody resides in a portion of IFN gamma that is proximal to, but distinct from the surface that interacts with the IFN gamma receptor. Therefore, this neutralizing monoclonal antibody reacts with a conformational determinant that distinguishes primate IFN gamma s serologically, but not functionally. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

At least 10 areas of gorilla Gorilla gorilla graueri occurrence, including eight of 17 areas identified during the first survey of the species in the massif in 1959, were found. Seventy-nine gorilla nest sites were recorded and at least 860 gorillas were estimated to occupy the massif. Fifty-six species of mammals were recorded. Itombwe supports the highest representation, of any area, of bird species endemic to the Albertine Rift highlands. Twenty-two of these species were recorded during the surveys, including the Congo bay owl Phodilus prigoginei, which was previously known from a single specimen collected in Itombwe nearly 50 years ago. No part of Itombwe is officially protected and conservation initiatives are needed urgently. Given the remoteness and continuing political instability of the region, conservation initiatives must collaborate with traditional authorities based in the massif, and should focus at the outset on protecting the gorillas and limiting further degradation of key areas."
"Status and conservation of primates in Odzala National Park, Republic of the Congo","['Bermejo, M']",ORYX,10.1046/j.1365-3008.1999.00081.x,OCT 1999,33,"A survey of diurnal primate populations was carried out in Odzala National Park, Republic of the Congo, over 3 months in 1994 and 2 months in 1995. The park contains a high diversity and species-specific abundance of primates, and has the highest number of diurnal primates (10 species) in the forest block of Central Africa. Eight species of monkey: greater white-nosed monkey Cercopithecus nictitans, moustached monkey Cercopithecus cephus, crowned guenon Cercopithecus pogonias, De Brazza's monkey Cercopithecus neglectus, talapoin Miopithecus talapoin, white-cheeked mangabey Cercocebus albigena, agile mangabey Cercocebus galeritus and guereza Colobus guereza, as well as gorilla Gorilla g. gorilla and chimpanzee Pan t. troglodytes were sighted in the survey. Monkey species richness was highest in dense inundated forest and thicket, with all eight species occurring in these habitats, whereas only four species were found in terra firma forest (consisting of the park's two main habitats, open-canopy Marantaceae forest and closed-canopy primary forest). Three of the four species (C. nictitans, C. cephus and C. albigena) present in terra firma forest were most abundant in closed-canopy primary forest (1.4, 1.0 and 0.6 groups per km, respectively) while the fourth (C. pogonias) was most abundant in open-canopy Marantaceae forest. Gorilla nests were most abundant in open-canopy Marantaceae forest(12.1 nests per km), while chimpanzee nests were mostly found in closed-canopy primary forest and Marantaceae forest (14 and 12 nests per km, respectively). Odzala has the highest recorded densities of western lowland gorilla (mean=5.4 individuals per sq km) and chimpanzee (mean=2.2 individuals per sq km) in Central Africa. The high densities of gorillas and chimpanzees may be a result of the high productivity of the forest and low poaching pressure. Conservation measures to ensure the maintenance of conditions in the area, such as educational programmes, are suggested."
Can nature tourism help finance protected areas in the Congo Basin?,"['Wilkie, DS', 'Carpenter, JF']",ORYX,NA,OCT 1999,26,"In the debt-ridden, high-population-growth, resource-mining states of the Congo Basin, conservation of biodiversity is seldom the primary concern of national policy makers or of local resource users. Moreover, the recurring costs of managing protected areas and the opportunity costs of forgoing logging and farming to maintain protected areas are a substantial net drain on national and local economies. Consequently, it is becoming increasingly important that protected areas generate, from user fees or donor contributions, sufficient funds to offset the costs of maintaining them. Government and donor investment currently meet less than 30 per cent of the estimated recurring costs required to manage the protected -area network within central African countries effectively, and cover none of the growing opportunity costs. Nature tourism, the fastest growing sector of the $US3 trillion (3 million million) a year global tourism industry, may offer a source of revenue to help fill this gap in funds. Congo Basin national parks and reserves harbour many charismatic animals (okapi, lowland gorilla, mandrills, bongo, forest elephant) that are likely to attract tourists, and as a result many protected-area managers are sinking capital into the development of tourist infrastructure. This paper reviews the evidence for ecotourism's capacity to generate revenue for protected-area management and appraises the financial viability of nature tourism in the Congo Basin."
"Characterisation of a novel HLA-A pseudogene, HLA-BEL, with significant sequence identity with a gorilla MHC class I gene","['Williams, F', 'Curran, MD', 'Middleton, D']",TISSUE ANTIGENS,10.1034/j.1399-0039.1999.540405.x,OCT 1999,8,"During the development of an HLA-A polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP) method far the identification of HLA-A*24 and -A*30 alleles, group amplification resulted in the formation of an unusual PCR product in certain individuals This fragment was approximately 900 bp smaller than the experted product and was also detected in some non-HLA-A*24 and -A*3D-positive individuals acting as negative controls for the group specific amplification. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this product identified it as a unique class I gene sequence displaying homology to both primate and human class I A-locus genes. The entire gene was amplified using PCR and the complete DNA sequence information from exon 1 to exon 8, including introns, was determined. A recombination event was identified which results in the fusion of intron 2 with intron 3, causing a deletion of the intervening exon 3 sequence. In addition, there are two cytosine insertions in the poly-cytosine stretch at the start of exon 4 which cause a frameshift and premature termination. The exon 1 and 2 sequences most closely align with the gorilla allele A*0501, displaying only five mismatches. PCR analysis has established that the gene is associated with the following HLA-A types: HLA-A*3001, -A*3301, -A*3303, -A*6802, A*2901, -A*0203, -A*0205 and -A*31012. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis of individuals containing this gene failed to detect any mRNA transcription, suggesting that this is a previously undescribed non-expressed class I pseudogene which we have provisionally named HLA-BEL. Its unique gene structure gives a possible insight into the evolutionary pathway that created HLA class I genes."

The internal flexion angle (IFA) was measured from lateral radiographs, and the craniofacial flexion angle (CFA) was calculated from coordinate data. Stage of dental development is used as a baseline for examination of growth changes and nonparametric correlations between flexion angles and dental development stage are tested for significance. In Gorilla, the IFA increases during growth. The IFA is relatively stable in Pan and modern humans. Pan and Gorilla display an increase in the CFA. However, this angle decreases during growth in modern humans. Flexion angles were derived from coordinate data collected for several early hominid crania. Measurements for two robust australopithecine crania indicate strong internal flexion. It has been suggested that cerebellar expansion in this group may relate to derived features of the posterior cranial base. In general, australopithecine crania exhibit craniofacial flexion intermediate between great apes and modern humans. The ""archaic"" Homo sapiens specimen from Kabwe is most similar to modern humans.

A critical review of methodology and interpretation of mirror self-recognition research in nonhuman primates,"['de Veer, MW', 'Van den Bos, R']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1006/anbe.1999.1166,SEP 1999,37,"In this paper we critically review conceptual and methodological issues of mirror self-exploration research. We conclude that: (1) mirror self-exploration provides evidence for mirror self-recognition; (2) inter- and intraspecies differences in terms of presence or absence of mirror self-recognition are not yet sufficiently clear, that is, whether its absence in species and individuals is methodological (false negative with respect to trait) or ontological (true negative with respect to trait) in nature; and (3) proposals of hypotheses to account phylogenetically for the existence of inter- and intraspecies differences in mirror self-recognition are premature. Before hypotheses such as these are advanced, the impact of rearing conditions on mirror self-recognition should be examined further. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."
Use of experimenter-given manual and facial cues by gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) in an object-choice task,"['Peignot, P', 'Anderson, JR']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/0735-7036.113.3.253,SEP 1999,55,"Captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) were tested for their ability to use experimenter-given manual and facial cues in an object-choice task. Performance levels were high when the experimenter tapped on or pointed at an object that contained a reward. Performance remained good when the experimenter witheld manual gestures and instead gazed with eyes and head oriented toward the correct object. In contrast, when only the experimenter's eye orientation served as the cue, the gorillas did not appropriately complete the task. Repeated attempts to establish prolonged mutual eye contact with 1 gorilla failed. The gorillas' failure to use eye signals as a cue may be due to an aversion to direct eye contact and contrasts with findings in other great apes. The results may indicate a difference among great ape species in detection of intentionality, but an alternative interpretation is that performance in such tests is influenced by factors such as rearing experience and temperament."
Development of a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction procedure for the detection of marine caliciviruses with potential application for nucleotide sequencing,"['Reid, SM', 'Ansell, DM', 'Ferris, NP', 'Hutchings, GH', 'Knowles, NJ', 'Smith, AW']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS,10.1016/S0166-0934(99)00088-9,SEP 1999,13,"A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedure is described for the detection of marine caliciviruses including vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV), San Miguel sea lion virus (SMSV), bovine Tillamook virus (BCV Bos-1) and caliciviruses (CV) isolated from dolphin (Cetacean CV), gorilla (Primate CV) and rattlesnake (Reptile CV) using primers (1F and 1R) designed from the capsid-coding region of the viral genome. These primers were compared with those described by Neill, J.D, and Seal, B.S., 1995: Development of PCR primers for specific amplification of two distinct regions of the genomes of San Miguel sea lion and vesicular exanthema of swine viruses, Mel. Cell. Probes 9, 33-38 (Hel1/Hel2), which had been designed from the 2C-like region of the calicivirus genome. Both sets proved to be extremely useful diagnostic tools for all of the known marine calicivirus serotypes with the exception of three: SMSV-8 and -12 and mink CV suggesting that these three caliciviruses may belong to a different group. Neither of the two primer sets reacted with strains of the vesicular disease viruses of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease (SVD) or vesicular stomatitis (VS) nor with two feline caliciviruses (FCV). The 1F/1R primer set has the advantage over the Hel1/Hel2 set in that it generates a larger PCR product for nucleotide sequence investigations and so provides greater opportunity for identifying molecular differences between the viruses.

"Tools, techniques and animals: the role of mediations of actions in the dynamics of social behaviours","['Lestel, D', 'Grundmann, E']",SOCIAL SCIENCE INFORMATION SUR LES SCIENCES SOCIALES,10.1177/053901899038003002,SEP 1999,5,"The definition of tool proposed by Berk (1980) is still the one referred to in ethology when discussing the question of tool-use in animals, and its pertinence is rarely questioned. However, observations on technical behaviours in animals have multiplied over the last 20 years, and these have profoundly altered our earlier representations. In the present article, we show that Beck's definition is insufficient and that it does not, in fact, work. More generally, we replace a theory of tools with a theory qi mediations of actions to account for technical behaviours in animals. We show that a culturally overcharged notion such as that of tool hinders our perception of the diversity and the complexity of tool tries. By speaking of mediations of actions and not of tools, we eliminate the problem of first defining the pertinent object (is it a tool or not?) and are free to concentrate on the means by which the animal externalizes its actions and thus Procures greater means of acting on these within a group. In so doing, we prepare the ground for a genuine evolutionary understanding of the dynamics of actions within a given animal population. Whereas, with a few exceptions, ethologists have always separated the question of techniques from that of social behaviour, we emphasize the importance dan ecology of mediations of actions for understanding the structure and dynamics of animal societies, in Particular by attempting to rethink such notions as ""culture"" in the perspective da general analysis of mediations of actions."
Many human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) proviruses are unique to humans,"['Barbulescu, M', 'Turner, G', 'Seaman, MI', 'Deinard, AS', 'Kidd, KK', 'Lenz, J']",CURRENT BIOLOGY,10.1016/S0960-9822(99)80390-X,AUG 26 1999,151,"Background: Endogenous retroviruses contribute to the evolution of the host genome and can be associated with disease. Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) is related to the mouse mammary tumor virus and is present in the genomes of humans, apes and cercopithecoids (Old World monkeys). It is unknown how long ago in primate evolution the full-length HERV-K proviruses that are in the human genome today were formed.

Results: Ten full-length HERV-K proviruses were cloned from the human genome. Using provirus-specific probes, eight of the ten were found to be present in a genetically diverse set of humans but not in other extant hominoids. Intact preintegration sites for each of these eight proviruses were present in the apes, A ninth provirus was detected in the human, chimpanzee, bonobo and gorilla genomes, but not in the orang-utan genome. The tenth was found only in humans, chimpanzees and bonobos, Complete sequencing of six of the human-specific proviruses showed that full-length open reading frames for the retroviral protein precursors Gag-Pro-Pol or Env were each present in multiple proviruses.

Conclusions: At least eight full-length HERV-K genomes that are in the human germline today integrated after humans diverged from chimpanzees. All of the viral open reading frames and cis-acting sequences necessary for HERV-K replication must have been intact during the recent time when these proviruses formed. Multiple full-length open reading frames for all HERV-K proteins are present in the human genome today."

We have examined an 832 bp. region, encompassing a putative Lateral Plate Mesoderm (LPM) enhancer element in a variety of anthropoid apes. The interspecific comparisons reveal extensive substitutions occurring within this region, with a marked bias in favor of C-->T transitions within the enhancer element. The pattern of these substitutions suggests that the LPM enhancer region is subject to specific sequence and compositional constraints that are only revealed through comparative sequencing. These constraints produce an enhancer signature, the CpG microisland, which may be useful in identifying additional regulatory elements located within the NOX complexes. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

CRH has been shown to have direct effects on the myometrium and on the fetal adrenal, where it stimulates production of the estrogen precursor dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate. In vitro placental CRH production is stimulated by cortisol and inhibited by progesterone. To determine whether this mechanism might operate in other apes, we sampled eight chimpanzees and two gorillas through their pregnancies for CRH, CRH-BP, cortisol, estradiol, progesterone, and alpha-fetoprotein. We show that both chimpanzee and gorilla maternal plasma CRH concentrations rise exponentially as observed in the human. The gorillas exhibited a human-like antepartum fall in CRH-BP, whereas CRH-BP in the chimpanzee remained stable. Pregnancy-associated changes in cortisol, estradiol, progesterone, and alpha-fetoprotein were qualitatively similar to those observed in humans. Maternal plasma cortisol correlated with plasma CRH in both gorillas (r = 0.60; P < 0.05) and chimpanzees (r = 0.36; P < 0.02). Further, there was a strong correlation between plasma estradiol and the log of plasma CRH in the gorilla (r = 0.93; P < 0.0001) and in the chimpanzee (r = 0.72; P < 0.001), which is consistent with the hypothesis that placental CRH determines the placental production of estradiol by stimulating the production of fetal adrenal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Plasma CRH and progesterone were positively correlated providing no in vivo support for progesterone inhibition of CRH release."

While a difference in the extent of air cell distribution has been noted in our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and gorillas, the processes responsible have been relatively unexplored. To examine these processes, a large, age-graded series of hominoid skulls was radiographed and the progress of pneumatization recorded. Additionally, a subsample of 30 chimpanzees and 12 gorillas was subjected to high-resolution CT scanning. Neonatal specimens show a well-developed mastoid antrum, as well as a capacious hypotympanum extending into the petrous apex. In African apes, as in humans, the mastoid antrum serves as the focus for air cell expansion into the mastoid and immediately adjacent areas. In chimpanzees and gorillas, however, a pronounced lateral structure, described as the squamous antrum, serves as the focus of pneumatization for anterior structures such as the squamous and zygomatic. The diminution of this structure in Homo sapiens explains the difference in air cell distribution in these regions. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Molecular evolution of the CMT1A-REP region: A human- and chimpanzee-specific repeat,"['Keller, MP', 'Seifried, BA', 'Chance, PF']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,AUG 1999,18,"The CMT1A-REP repeat consists of two copies of a 24-kb sequence on human chromosome 17p11.2-12 that flank a 1.5-Mb region containing a dosage-sensitive gene, peripheral nerve protein-22 (PMP22). Unequal meiotic cross over mediated by misalignment of proximal and distal copies of the CMT1A-REP in humans leads to a 1.5-Mb duplication or deletion associated with two common peripheral nerve diseases, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). Previous molecular hybridization studies with CMT1A-REP sequences suggested that two copies of the repeat are also found in the chimpanzee, raising the possibility that this unique repeat arose during primate evolution. To further characterize the structure and evolutionary synthesis of the CMT1A-REP repeat, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and heterologous PCR-based assays were carried out for a series of primates. Genomic DNA was analyzed with primers selected to differentially amplify the centromeric and telomeric ends of the human proximal and distal CMT1A-REP elements and an associated mariner (MLE) sequence. All primate species examined (common chimpanzee, pygmy chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, baboon, rhesus monkey, green monkey, owl monkey, and galago) tested positive for a copy of the distal element. In addition to humans, only the chimpanzee was found to have a copy of the proximal CMT1A-REP element. All but one primate species (galago) tested positive for the MLE located within the CMT1A-REP sequence. These observations confirm the hypothesis that the distal CMT1A-REP element is the ancestral sequence which was duplicated during primate evolution, provide support for a human-chimpanzee clade, and suggest that insertion of the MLE into the CMT1A-REP sequence occurred in the ancestor of anthropoid primates."

Evolution of MHC-G in primates: a different kind of molecule for each group of species,"['Arnaiz-Villena, A', 'Morales, P', 'Gomez-Casado, E', 'Castro, MJ', 'Varela, P', 'Rojo-Amigo, R', 'Martinez-Laso, J']",JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE IMMUNOLOGY,10.1016/S0165-0378(99)00026-1,JUL 1999,25,"When MHC-G molecules in primates (New World and Old World monkeys, Anthropoids and humans) were compared phylogenetically, very different evolutionary patterns within each species were found; their molecules did not have a straight forward and linear development throughout the postulated evolutionary pathway of primates. The earlier New World monkeys (South America) had relatively more alleles and the polymorphism was placed in the T-cell receptor (TcR), NK receptors and antigen binding sites; MHC-G probably works as a classical class I presenting molecule in these monkeys. MHC-G intron 2 from New World monkeys does not show the typical 23 bp deletion found in all other more recent primate species. Thus, it is possible that MHC-G molecules in New World monkeys belong to a different lineage than the MHC from higher primates. Another early lineage, Eurasian Old World monkeys, shows stop codons at exon 3: MHC-G proteins lacking the alpha 2 domain may functionally suffice or otherwise reading-through stop-codon translational mechanisms may exist, as shown for other genes. Orangutans show lower (but significant) polymorphism than New World monkeys at NK, TcR and antigen binding regions; gorilla and chimpanzee show very low polymorphism. Humans only show three different HLA-G proteins with changes not affecting NK, TcR or antigen binding sites. It is observed that the more exposed the mother to allogeneic fetuses (polygamy), the less polymorphic HLA-G is observed within a given species. The data are concordant with the postulated immune inhibitory function for MHC-G in Old World monkeys, anthropoids and humans both at placental and inflammatory level.

This is also the case for other taxa involved in the bushmeat trade, which crosses geographic, cultural and economic boundaries. A suite of measures must be considered to mitigate the effects of this trade, and these measures will have to recognize the local, regional and national socio-economic importance of the trade if they are to result in long-term conservation success."
Spontaneous use of sticks as tools by captive gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Nakamichi, M']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557584,JUL 1999,16,"The present report describes the spontaneous use of sticks as tools by young adult gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in a social group at the San Diego Wild Animal Park, CA, USA. Three 8-year-old gorillas tone female and two males) threw sticks into the foliage of trees, which the gorillas could not climb due to electric wire, to knock down leaves and seeds. Two of the three gorillas selected sticks that were more suitable (i.e, longer or thicker sticks) for throwing. Moreover, they looked up at the target (i.e. the foliage of the tree) before throwing and grasped the stick at a position appropriate for throwing (i.e. the end of the stick). They were more likely to throw sticks when particular adult group members were not nearby. These two gorillas also pulled branches of trees toward themselves by using sticks to capture them (branch-pulling), and one of these two beat a branch with a stick to knock down leaves and seeds (branch-beating. One of these two gorillas used much longer sticks for branch-pulling than for stick-throwing, indicating that he was capable of task-dependent selection of sticks. Analyzing the spontaneous use of sticks as tools by gorillas in captivity can lead to a better understanding of not only their cognitive ability but also of their social relationships, which may otherwise be concealed."

Concerted evolution of the tandem array encoding primate U2 snRNA (the RNU2 locus) is accompanied by dramatic remodeling of the junctions with flanking chromosomal sequences,"['Pavelitz, T', 'Liao, DQ', 'Weiner, AM']",EMBO JOURNAL,10.1093/emboj/18.13.3783,JUL 1 1999,16,"The genes encoding primate U2 snRNA are organized as a nearly perfect tandem array (the RNU2 locus) that has been evolving concertedly for >35 Myr since the divergence of baboons and humans. Thus the repeat units of the tandem array are essentially identical within each species, but differ between species. Homogeneity is maintained because any change in one repeat unit is purged from the array or fixed in all other repeats. Intriguingly, the cytological location of RNU2 has remained unchanged despite concerted evolution of the tandem array. We had found previously that junction sequences between the U2 tandem array and flanking DNA were subject to remodeling over a region of 200-300 bp during the past 5 Myr in the hominid lineage. Here we show that the junctions between the U2 tandem array and flanking DNA have undergone dramatic rearrangements over a region of 1 to >10 kbp in the 35 Myr since divergence of the Old World Monkey and hominid lineages. We argue that these rearrangements reflect the high level of genetic activity required to sustain concerted evolution, and propose a model to explain why maintenance of homogeneity within a tandemly repeated multigene family would lead to junctional diversity."
Origin and phylogenetic distribution of Alu DNA repeats: Irreversible events in the evolution of primates,"['Hamdi, H', 'Nishio, H', 'Zielinski, R', 'Dugaiczyk, A']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,10.1006/jmbi.1999.2797,JUN 18 1999,69,"Over the past 60 million years, or so, approximately one million copies of Alu DNA repeats have accumulated in the genome of primates, in what appears to be an ongoing process. We determined the phylogenetic distribution of specific Alu (and other) DNA repeats in the genome of several primates: human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, baboon, rhesus, and macaque. At the population level studied, the majority of the repeats was found to be fixed in the primate species. Our data suggest that new Alu elements arise in unique, irreversible events, in a mechanism that seems to preclude precise excision and loss. The same insertions did not arise independently in two species. Once inserted and genetically fixed, the DNA elements are retained in all descendant lineages. The irreversible expansion of Alus introduces a vector of time into the evolutionary process, and provides realistic (rather than statistical) answers to questions on phylogenies. In contrast to point mutations, the present distribution of individual Alus is congruent with just one phylogeny. We submit that only irreversible and taxonomically relevant events are at the molecular basis of evolution. Most point mutations do not belong to this category. (C) 1999 Academic Press."
Tracing the origin of HLA-DRB1 alleles by microsatellite polymorphism,"['Bergstrom, TF', 'Engkvist, H', 'Erlandsson, R', 'Josefsson, A', 'Mack, SJ', 'Erlich, HA', 'Gyllensten, U']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS,10.1086/302401,JUN 1999,21,"We analyzed the origin of allelic diversity at the class II HLA-DRB1 locus, using a complex microsatellite located in intron 2, close to the polymorphic second exon. A phylogenetic analysis of human, gorilla, and chimpanzee DRB1 sequences indicated that the structure of the microsatellite has evolved, primarily by point mutations, from a putative ancestral (GT)(x)(GA)(y)-complex-dinucleotide repeat. In all contemporary DRB1 allelic lineages, with the exception of the human *04 and the gorilla *08 lineages, the (GA)(y) repeat is interrupted, often by a G-->C substitution. In general, the length of the 3' (GA)(y) repeat correlates with the allelic lineage and thus evolves more slowly than a middle (GA)(z) repeat, whose length correlates with specific alleles within the lineage. Comparison of the microsatellite sequence from 30 human DRB1 alleles showed the longer 5' (GT)(x) to be more variable than the shorter middle (GA)(z) and 3' (GA)(y) repeats. Analysis of multiple samples with the same exon sequence, derived from different continents, showed that the 5' (GT)(x) repeat evolves more rapidly than the middle (GA)(z) and the 3' (GA)(y) repeats, which is consistent with findings of a higher mutation rate for longer tracts. The microsatellite-repeat-length variation was used to trace the origin of new DRB1 alleles, such as the new *08 alleles found in the Cayapa people of Ecuador and the Ticuna people of Brazil."
Suppression of a mitochondrial tRNA gene mutation phenotype associated with changes in the nuclear background,"['Hao, HL', 'Morrison, LE', 'Moraes, CT']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/8.6.1117,JUN 1999,42,"We previously have characterized a pathogenic mtDNA mutation in the tRNA(Asn) gene, This mutation (G5703A) was associated with a severe mitochondrial protein synthesis defect and a reduction in steady-state levels of tRNA(Asn). We now show that, although transmitochondrial cybrids harboring homoplasmic levels of the mutation do not survive in galactose medium, several galactose-resistant clones could be obtained. These cell lines had restored oxidative phosphorylation function and 2-fold higher steady-state levels of tRNA(Asn) when compared with the parental mutant cell line, The revertant lines contained apparently homoplasmic levels of the mutation and no other detectable alteration in the tRNA(Asn) gene. To investigate the origin of the suppression, we transferred mtDNA from the revertants (143B/206 TK-) to a different nuclear background (143B/207 TK-, 8AG(r)), These new transmitochondrial cybrids became defective once again in oxidative phosphorylation and regained galactose sensitivity. However, galactose-resistant clones could also be obtained by growing the 8AG(r) transmitochondrial cybrids under selection. Because the original rate of reversion was higher than that expected by a classic second site nuclear mutation, and because of the aneuploid features of these cell lines, we searched for the presence of chromosomal alterations that could be associated with the revertant phenotype, These studies, however, did not reveal any gross changes. Our results suggest that modulation of the dosage or expression of unknown nuclear-coded factor(s) can compensate for a pathogenic mitochondrial tRNA gene mutation, suggesting new strategies for therapeutic intervention."
Evolution of a HOXB6 intergenic region within the great apes and humans,"['Deinard, A', 'Kidd, K']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1999.0298,JUN 1999,48,"Data accumulated over the past decade from several loci suggest that nonhuman primates have a greater amount of intraspecific genetic variation relative to humans. In phylogenetic reconstructions among primates that are based on genetic data, therefore, it becomes essential to adequately sample the population(s) being analyzed. Inadequate sampling may not only underestimate variation within any given population, but such an underestimate may confound any phylogenetic or population-specific conclusions implied by the data. Here we present inter- and intraspecific data on the molecular evolution of an approximately 1.0 kb intergenic HOXB6 sequence among humans, common chimpanzees, pygmy chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans. To date, this study represents the most comprehensive investigation of a noncoding nuclear locus among the great apes and humans that examines the nature and amount of intraspecific variation in DNA sequences. Not only do these HOXB6 data continue to support earlier findings that Homo sapiens sapiens has less genetic variation than any gnat ape species (Ruano et al., 1992; Deinard & Kidd, 1995), but they strongly suggest that a high level of genetic polymorphism existed within the common ancestor of the African ape clade (Homo-Pan-Gorilla). Despite detecting two nucleotide substitutions linking Pan and Homo, we caution against concluding that the HOXB6 data definitively support a Home-Pan clade to the exclusion of Gorilla. Rather, we believe that taking into consideration the level of genetic polymorphism that is likely to have existed within the common ancestor, the most prudent conclusion that can be made from all available data, including morphological, karyotypic and genetic data, may be that speciation among Homo-Pan-Gorilla is best represented by a ""trichotomy"".

Anti-human red cell monoclonal antibodies produced by macaque-mouse heterohybridomas: Their reactivity with human and nonhuman primate erythrocytes,"['Blancher, A', 'Roubinet, F', 'Reld, M', 'Socha, WW']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,NA,JUN 1999,5,"Eighteen monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) against human red blood cells (RBCs) produced by macaque-mouse heterobybridomas gave uniformly positive reactions with all human samples except for some with particular null phenotypes. Based on reactions with latter cells, the human antigenic targets of 11 antibodies could be identified: six were specific for glycophorin-related antigens (Wr(b), En(a), Ge4), and each of the five remaining antibodies showed one of the following specificities: CD55, CD44, CD59, Kell, and Rh proteins. Four Mabs recognized the V-c antigen of the chimpanzee V-A-B-D system. Six macaque Mabs detected polymorphisms in chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon that did not correspond to any known blood group in these animals, while other Mabs gave monomorphic reactions with ape RBCs. The reagents produced by macaque hybridomas are useful tools not only for human blood grouping tests, but also for tracing the relationships among blood group antigens of man and anthropoid apes."
Chronic hypertension with subsequent congestive heart failure in a western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Miller, CL', 'Schwartz, AM', 'Barnhart, JS', 'Bell, MD']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,JUN 1999,12,"Chronic severe subclinical systemic hypertension was diagnosed in a 28-yr-old male western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Thoracic radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography revealed an enlarged heart with a hypertrophied left ventricle, mitral regurgitation, and a persistent left bundle branch black. Enalapril, later combined with nifedipine, was of some value in reducing the hypertension, with partial reversal of cardiac enlargement and resolution of the bundle branch block. Two years after initiation of treatment, the gorilla developed lethargy and dyspnea. The diagnosis of heart failure was confirmed under anesthesia; the gorilla did not recover and was euthanized. Postmortem examination confirmed congestive heart failure with chronic, fibrosing cardiomyopathy similar to that in other gorillas."

Clinical signs of the disease were pyrexia, abdominal distention, splenomegaly, and lethargy. Acute lymphocytic leukemia has rarely been reported in this species, and therapy was based on human oncologic protocols. Remission induction chemotherapy resulted in complete clearing of leukemia cells from the bone marrow. Consolidation and maintenance chemotherapy followed. Therapy was facilitated by the use of an infusion port for i.v. treatments and an indwelling lumbar catheter for intrathecal therapy. Side effects associated with chemotherapy were inappetence, moderate alopecia, pancytopenia resulting in sepsis, and bleeding tendency. in spite of initial success, the leukemia reappeared 120 days into treatment. The gorilla was euthanized 7 days later when respiratory distress developed. Intensive care by the animal staff was a key factor in the treatment of this gorilla."

From this data we determined 214 proposed ancestral alleles (the sequence found in the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees). In a diverse human population set, we found that SNP alleles with higher frequencies were more likely to be ancestral than less frequently occurring alleles, There were, however, exceptions. We also found three shared human/pygmy chimpanzee polymorphisms, all involving CpG dinucleotides, and two shared human/gorilla polymorphisms, one involving a CpG dinucleotide. We demonstrate that mi;microarray-based assays allow rapid comparative sequence analysis of intra- and interspecies genetic variation."
Nutritional characteristics of wild primate foods: Do the diets of our closest living relatives have lessons for us?,"['Milton, K']",NUTRITION,10.1016/S0899-9007(99)00078-7,JUN 1999,89,"The widespread prevalence of diet-related health problems, particularly in highly industrialized nations, suggests that many humans are not eating in a manner compatible with their biology. Anthropoids, including all great apes, take most of their diet from plants, and there is general consensus that humans come from a strongly herbivorous ancestry. Though gut proportions differ, overall gut anatomy and the pattern of digestive kinetics of extant apes and humans are very similar. Analysis of tropical forest leaves and fruits routinely consumed by wild primates shows that many of these foods are good sources of hexoses, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectic substances, vitamin C, minerals, essential fatty acids, and protein. In general, relative to body weight, the average wild monkey or ape appears to take in far higher levels of many essential nutrients each day than the average American and such nutrients (as well as other substances) are being consumed together in their natural chemical matrix, The recommendation that Americans Consume more fresh fruits and vegetables in greater variety appears well supported by data on the diets of free-ranging monkeys and apes. Such data also suggest that greater attention to features of the diet and digestive physiology of non-human primates could direct attention to important areas for future research on features of human diet and health.

An environment of this type can stimulate learning and comprehension, because it provides a tight coupling between symbolic and experiential information. In our virtual zoo exhibit, students can explore an accurate model of the gorilla habitat at Zoo Atlanta and access information related to the design of the exhibit. This paper discusses the design of the application and the interaction techniques used to obtain information. We also present the results of a formal evaluation. Although no statistically significant differences were found, results indicate that students who used the virtual environment had higher test scores than those who only attended a lecture on the material. Trends suggest that the virtual experience allowed students to learn information directly and also equipped them to better learn and understand material from a traditional lecture."

These males are of adolescent to adult age and are reproductive, but have Little to no secondary sexual trait development. Until now the only endocrine study of this arrest of secondary sexual trait development was performed by Kingsley (1982, 1988). She found that ""subadult"" or arrested males have lower testosterone levels than similar age developing adolescents or adult males. In this study, urine samples were collected over a two-year period from 23 captive male orangutans in order to more fully define male endocrine profiles. Three study males were juveniles, seven were arrested adolescents, six were developing adolescents, and seven were mature adults. Morning samples were analyzed by radioimmunoassay for levels of testicular steroids and gonadotropins and group hormone profiles were compared by analysis of variance. Results illustrate that arrested adolescent orangutans have significantly lower testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels than developing adolescents, but significantly higher levels than juveniles. Luteinizing hormone (LH) levels also differed between arrested and developing adolescents, with arrested males having lower levels. However, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were similar in both morphs of adolescent male. The overall hormone profiles for arrested and developing adolescent male orangutans suggest that arrested males lack levels of LH, testosterone, and DHT necessary far development of secondary sexual traits. However, they have sufficient testicular steroids, LH, and FSH to fully develop primary sexual function and fertility. These endocrine data help define alternative developmental pathways in male orangutans. The authors discuss the relationship between these developmental pathways and male orangutan reproductive strategies, and hypothesize about their prepubertal socioendocrine determination.

Articular surface defects in the third metatarsal and third cuneiform: Nonosseous tarsal coalition,"['Regan, MH', 'Case, DT', 'Brundige, JC']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199905)109:1<53::AID-AJPA6>3.0.CO;2-P,MAY 1999,13,"Frequencies of articular surface defects on the third metatarsal and third cuneiform, seen as pits of varying sizes on the plantar one third of the tarsometatarsal articular face, were investigated in skeletal populations from North America and Japan, as well as in gibbon, orangutan, chimpanzee, and gorilla skeletons. The apes did not exhibit the defects, although the number of observed specimens of each type was small. The newly presented human frequencies corresponded well with those from other published sources. The defects appeared both unilaterally and bilaterally, with no apparent sex or side biases. Statistical tests between the various populations found that, in general, geographically close. populations had more similar frequencies of the defect. Possible etiologies for the defect were investigated, including biomechanical influences, degenerative arthritis, infection, trauma, and a developmental condition known as tarsal coalition, which proved to be the best explanation. Tarsal coalition results from the failure of a joint space to form properly during fetal growth. It can occur between any two adjacent bones of the foot. Several clinically important coalitions, whose presence interferes with normal walking, are known. However, coalition between the third metatarsal and third cuneiform has not been reported in the clinical Literature, suggesting that the defect causes little or no foot dysfunction. Tarsal coalition is thought to have a strong genetic component, suggesting that the pit defect may be useful as a skeletal nonmetric trait, as others have stated. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Morphological and taxonomic affinities of the Olduvai ulna (OH 36),"['Aiello, LC', 'Wood, B', 'Key, C', 'Lewis, M', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199905)109:1<89::AID-AJPA8>3.0.CO;2-4,MAY 1999,30,"The OH 36 ulna derives from Upper Bed II in the Olduvai Gorge, and is dated to circa 1.1-1.2 Myr. Multivariate analyses incorporating data from samples of modern humans, common and pygmy chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and two other early hominin ulnae, Omo L40-19 and KNM-BK 66, suggest that OK 36 belonged to an individual with powerful forearms consistent with a locomotor repertoire that included arboreal locomotion. However, there is no compelling evidence that it made regular use of its forelimbs as supports when travelling on the ground. When compared with levels of intra- and intertaxon size and shape variation in the comparative sample (humans, chimpanzees, gorillas), the differences between OH 36, KNM-BK 66, and Omo L40-19 are compatible with OH 36 differing from the other two fossil hominin ulnae to the extent that modern humans differ from modern great apes. KNM-BK 66 and Omo L40-19 differ from each other in overall size and shape only to the degree that would be expected within any of the individual modern comparative samples.

Based on these analyses, there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that OH 36 and Omo L40-19 belong to the same species of fossil hominin, or to two species that shared a similar forelimb locomotor repertoire. We suggest that OH 36 has the greater claim to be assigned to Paranthropus boisei, and we recommend that for the time being the latter be referred to the tribe Hominini gen. et sp. indet. The surprising result of these analyses is the overall size and shape similarity between Omo L40-19 and KNM-BK 66, two fossils that are separated in time by more than 1.5 million years, and which have traditionally been assumed to represent hominin species with quite different locomotor patterns.

"Factors affecting mirror behaviour in western lowland gorillas, Gorilla gorilla
","['Shillito, DJ', 'Gallup, GG', 'Beck, BB']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1006/anbe.1998.1062,MAY 1999,32,"To date, it has proven difficult to demonstrate mirror self-recognition in gorillas. However, gorillas display pronounced gaze aversion that may prevent them from spending a sufficient amount of time exploring their mirror images to understand that they are the source of their reflections. It has also been suggested that the presence of observers may inhibit gorillas from engaging in mark-directed behaviours. To overcome th problem of gaze aversion, we used an angled-mirror apparatus developed by Anderson st Roeder (1989, Primates, 30, 581-587) that prevented two gorillas at the National Zoological Park from making direct eye contact with their reflections. To counter the observer inhibition hypothesis, we conducted mark tests on these animals using video cameras. Despite addressing these and other concerns in a series of four experiments, the gorillas did not show compelling evidence of self-recognition, even after over 4 years of mirror exposure.

Male mating patterns in wild multimale mountain gorilla groups,"['Robbins, MM']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1006/anbe.1998.1063,MAY 1999,52,"lAlthough mountain gorillas, Gorilla gorilla beringei, are classified as having a one-male mating system, approximately 40% of the social units are multimale groups. I observed two multimale groups of mountain gorillas at the Karisoke Research Center, Rwanda, Africa, for 17 months to determine male mating patterns and male-male mating harassment in relation to both male dominance rank and female reproductive status. Dominant males mated significantly more than did individual subordinate males, and dominant males mated more with cycling adult and pregnant females. The dominant males participated in 47 and 83% of observed matings in the two groups. Subordinate males were more likely than dominant males to mate with subadult females. Eleven of 14 females were observed to mate with more than one male, and multiple males mated with three of the five females observed at the probable time of conception. Mating harassment was initiated and received by both dominant and subordinate males. Mating harassment occurred infrequently (during 30 and 22% of matings in each group), usually consisted of mild aggression; and usually terminated copulations by subordinate males, but not those by dominant males. These results suggest that multimale mountain gorilla groups can be favourable environments for subordinate males to obtain mating opportunities. Dominant males may be unable or unwilling to prevent subordinate males from mating. Based on behavioural observations, mountain gorillas can have a multimale mating system but further research on the role of females in male mating success and paternity determination is needed to understand fully this species' mating system.

"Shape of the orbital opening: individual characterization and analysis of variability in modern humans, Gorilla gorilla, and Pan troglodytes","['Schmittbuhl, M', 'Le Minor, JM', 'Allenbach, B', 'Schaaf, A']",ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER,10.1016/S0940-9602(99)80049-1,MAY 1999,9,"The description of the human orbital shape is principally qualitative in the classical literature, and characterised by adjectives such as circular, rectangular or quadrangular. In order to provide a precise quantification and interpretation of this shape, a study based on automatic image analysis and Fourier analysis was carried out on 45 human skulls (30 males, 15 females), and for comparison on 61 skulls of Gorilla gorilla (40 males, 21 females), and 34 skulls of Pan troglodytes (20 males, 14 females). Sexual dimorphism in the shape of the orbital opening was not demonstrated. Its dominant morphological features could be characterized by Fourier analysis; elliptical elongation and quadrangularity were dominant morphological features of the shape of the orbital opening in the three species. Elliptical elongation was more marked in humans and Pan, whereas quadrangularity was particularly emphasized in Gorilla. An intraspecific variability of the shape of the orbital opening existed in humans, Gorilla and Pan, and seemed close in the three species. Interspecific partition between humans, Gorilla and Pan was demonstrated despite the variability observed in the three species studied. Interspecific differences between Gorilla and the Pan-humans group were principally explained by the differences in quadrangularity, and by differences in orientation of triangularity and pentagonality. Differences in the shape of the orbital opening between humans and Pan were principally explained by differences in hexagonality, and by differences in orientation of quadrangularity. A closeness of shape between some humans and some individuals in Pan and, to a lesser degree, with some individuals in Gorilla was observed, demonstrating the existence of a morphological continuum of the shape of the orbital opening in hominoids."
Differential pharmacology between the guinea-pig and the gorilla 5-HT1D receptor as probed with isochromans (5-HT1D-selective ligands),"['Pregenzer, JF', 'Alberts, GL', 'Bin Im, W', 'Slightom, JL', 'Ennis, MD', 'Hoffman, RL', 'Ghazal, NB', 'TenBrink, RE']",BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY,10.1038/sj.bjp.0702532,MAY 1999,29,"1 Both the 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B receptors are implicated in migraine pathophysiology. Recently isochromans have been discovered to bind primate 5-HT1D receptors with much higher affinity than 5-HT1B receptors. In the guinea-pig, a primary animal model for anti-migraine drug testing, however, isochromans bound the 5-HT1D receptor with lower affinity than the gorilla receptor.

2 This species-specific pharmacology was investigated, using site-directed mutagenesis on cloned guinea-pig receptors heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Mutations of threonine 100 and arginine 102 at the extracellular side of transmembrane II of the guinea-pig 5-HT1D receptor to the corresponding primate residues, isoleucine and histidine, respectively, enhanced its affinity for isochromans to that of the gorilla receptor, with little effects on its affinities for serotonin, sumatriptan and metergoline. Free energy change from the R102M mutation was about twice as much as that from the T100I mutation.

3 For G protein-coupling, serotonin marginally enhanced GTP gamma(35)S binding in membranes expressing the guinea-pig 5-HT1D receptor and its mutants, but robustly in membranes expressing the gorilla receptor. Sumatriptan enhanced GTP gamma(35)S binding in the latter nearly as much as serotonin. and several isochromans by 30-60% of serotonin.

4 We discovered key differences in the function and binding properties of guinea-pig and gorilla 5-HT1D receptors, and identified contributions of I100 and H102 of primate 5-HT1D receptors to isochroman binding. Among common experimental animals, only the rabbit shares I100 and H102 with primates, and could be useful for studying isochroman actions in vivo."
Comparative mapping of the region of human chromosome 7 deleted in Williams syndrome,"['DeSilva, U', 'Massa, H', 'Trask, BJ', 'Green, ED']",GENOME RESEARCH,NA,MAY 1999,53,"Williams syndrome (WS) is a complex developmental disorder resulting from the deletion of a large (similar to 1.5-2 Mb) segment of human chromosome 7q11.23. Physical mapping studies have revealed that this deleted region, which contains a number of known genes, is flanked by several large, nearly identical blocks of DNA. The presence of such highly related DNA segments in close physical proximity to one another has hampered efforts to elucidate the precise long-range organization of this segment of chromosome 7. To gain insight about the structure and evolutionary origins of this important and complex genomic region, we have constructed a fully contiguous bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and Pi-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) contig map encompassing the corresponding region on mouse chromosome 5. In contrast to the difficulties encountered in constructing a clone-based physical map of the human WS region, the BAC/PAC-based map of the mouse WS region was straightforward to construct, with no evidence of large duplicated segments, such as those encountered in the human WS region. To confirm this difference, representative human and mouse BACs were used as probes For performing fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to metaphase and interphase chromosomes. Human BACs derived from the nonunique portion of the WS region hybridized to multiple, closely spaced regions on human chromosome 7q11.23. In contrast, corresponding mouse BACs hybridized to a single site on mouse chromosome 5. Furthermore, FISH analysis revealed the presence of duplicated segments within the WS region of various nonhuman primates (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon). Hybridization was also noted at the genomic locations corresponding to human chromosome 7p22 and 7q22 in human, chimpanzee, and gorilla, but not in the other animal species examined. Together, these results indicate that the WS region is associated with large, duplicated blocks of DNA on human chromosome 7q11.23 as well as the corresponding genomic regions of other nonhuman primates. However, such duplications are not present in the mouse."
DNA sequence variation in a non-coding region of low recombination on the human X chromosome,"['Kaessmann, H', 'Heissig, F', 'von Haeseler, A', 'Paabo, S']",NATURE GENETICS,10.1038/8785,MAY 1999,176,"DNA sequence variation has become a major source of insight regarding the origin and history of our species(1-5) as well as an important tool for the identification of allelic variants associated with disease. Comparative sequencing of DNA has to date focused mainly on mitochondrial (mt) DNA, which due to its apparent lack of recombination and high evolutionary rate lends itself well to the study of human evolution(1). These advantages also entail limitations. For example, the high mutation rate of mtDNA results in multiple substitutions that make phylogenetic analysis difficult and, because mtDNA is maternally inherited, it reflects only the history of females. For the history of males, the non-recombining part of the paternally inherited Y chromosome can be studied(2). The extent of variation on the Y chromosome is so low that variation at particular sites known to be polymorphic rather than entire sequences are typically determined(6). It is currently unclear how some forms of analysis (such as the coalescent) should be applied to such data, Furthermore, the lack of recombination means that selection at any locus affects all 59 Mb of DNA. To gauge the extent and pattern of point substitutional variation in non-coding parts of the human genome, we have sequenced 10 kb of non-coding DNA in a region of low recombination at Xq13.3. Analysis of this sequence in 69 individuals representing all major linguistic groups reveals the highest overall diversity in Africa, whereas deep divergences also exist in Asia. The time elapsed since the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) is 535.000+/-119.000 years, We expect this type of nuclear locus to provide more answers about the genetic origin and history of humans."
Mitochondrial sequences show diverse evolutionary histories of African hominoids,"['Gagneux, P', 'Wills, C', 'Gerloff, U', 'Tautz, D', 'Morin, PA', 'Boesch, C', 'Fruth, B', 'Hohmann, G', 'Ryder, OA', 'Woodruff, DS']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.96.9.5077,APR 27 1999,193,"Phylogenetic trees for the four extant species of African hominoids are presented, based on mtDNA control region-1 sequences from 1,158 unique haplotypes. We include 83 new haplotypes of western chimpanzees and bonobos. Phylogenetic analysis of this enlarged database, which takes intraspecific geographic variability into account, reveals different patterns of evolution among species and great heterogeneity in species-level variation. Several chimpanzee and bonobo clades (and even single social groups) have retained substantially more mitochondrial variation than is seen in the entire human species, Among the 811 human haplotypes, those that branch off early are predominantly but not exclusively African. Neighbor joining trees provide strong evidence that eastern chimpanzee and human clades have experienced reduced effective population sizes, the latter apparently since the Homo sapiens-neanderthalensis split. Application of topiary pruning resolves ambiguities in the phylogenetic tree that are attributable to homoplasies in the data set. The diverse patterns of mtDNA sequence variation seen in today's hominoid taxa probably reflect historical differences in ecological plasticity, female-biased dispersal, range fragmentation over differing periods of time, and competition among social groups. These results are relevant to the origin of zoonotic diseases, including HIV-1, and call into question some aspects of the current taxonomic treatment and conservation management of gorillas and chimpanzees."
A review of nutritional and motivational factors contributing to the performance of regurgitation and reingestion in captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Lukas, KE']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/S0168-1591(98)00239-1,APR 23 1999,31,"Regurgitation and reingestion (R/R) is a common phenomenon in captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), but it has never been reported in wild populations. Although changes in diet have been shown to reduce the behavior, little is known about the underlying mechanisms that lead to its development and maintenance. In this paper, a comparative analysis of ruminatory behavior in humans and stereotypic behavior in captive, domesticated animals reveals several nutritional and motivational factors that may contribute to the sustained performance of this behavior in captive gorillas. Additional research is needed to evaluate temporal, seasonal, gustatory, social, individual, and medical influences on this behavior. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

These retroviruses are called simian T-lymphotrophic virus type I (STLV-I). Infection with STLV-I has been associated with lymphoma and leukaemia in macaques, baboons, African green monkeys and gorillas. However, no STLV-I infection has been detected in New World primates, although STLV-II has been detected in spider monkeys.

When sera from 10 species of non-human primates maintained at the Institute of Primate Research were screened for STLV-I infection, anti-STLV-I antibodies were detected in 12%, 12%, 23% and 38% of the olive baboons, yellow baboons, African green monkeys and lowland Sykes' monkeys, respectively. Western-blot studies confirmed these results. To date, no clinical disease has been linked with STLV-I infection in these colonies. The relatively high prevalence of anti-STLV-I antibodies in these non-human primates offers an opportunity for studies on the transmission, phylogenetic relationships and natural history of STLV-I in primate colonies."
Phylogenetic analysis of primate MIC (PERB11) sequences suggests that the representation of the gene family differs in different primates: comparison of MIC (PERB11) and C4,"['Cattley, SK', 'Longman, N', 'Dawkins, RL', 'Gaudieri, S', 'Kulski, JK', 'Leelayuwat, C']",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1046/j.1365-2370.1999.00154.x,APR-JUN 1999,8,"Duplication of segments within the MHC has led to numerous multicopy families such as class I, class II, C4 and MIC (PERB11). Different copy numbers between haplotypes and species may be explained by the extent of duplication and subsequent deletion. There are at least five copies of MIC (PERB11) in humans, but MICA (PERB11.1) appears to have been deleted from the chimpanzee.

By comparing the sequences of primates (chimpanzee, gorilla, gibbon, orang-utan, pygmy chimpanzee, Patas monkey, Aethiops and baboon) we conclude that the gorilla has a copy of PERB11.1, whereas the baboon and Patas possess MICD (PERB11.4) and/or MICE (PERB11.5 rather than MICA.

High polymorphism at the human melanocortin 1 receptor locus,"['Rana, BK', 'Hewett-Emmett, D', 'Jin, L', 'Chang, BHJ', 'Sambuughin, N', 'Lin, M', 'Watkins, S', 'Bamshad, M', 'Jorde, LB', 'Ramsay, M', 'Jenkins, T', 'Li, WH']",GENETICS,NA,APR 1999,179,"Variation in human skin/hair pigmentation is due to varied amounts of eumelanin (brown/black melanins) and phaeomelanin (red/yellow melanins) produced by the melanocytes. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is a regulator of eu- and phaeomelanin production in the melanocytes, and MC1R mutations causing coat color changes are known in many mammals. We have sequenced the MC1R gene in 121 individuals sampled from world populations with an emphasis on Asian populations. We found variation at five nonsynonymous sites (resulting in the variants Arg67Gln, Asp84Glu, Val92Met, Arg151Cys, and Arg163Gln), but at only one synonymous site (A942G). interestingly, the human consensus protein sequence is observed in all 25 African individuals studied, but at lower frequencies in the other populations examined, especially in East and Southeast Asians. The Arg163Gln variant is absent in the Africans studied, almost absent in Europeans, and at a low frequency (7%) in Indians, but is at an exceptionally high frequency (70%) in East and Southeast Asians. The MC1R gene in common and pygmy chimpanzees, gorilla, orangutan, and baboon was sequenced to study the evolution of MC1R. The ancestral human MC1R sequence is identical to the human consensus protein sequence, while MC1R varies considerably among higher primates. A comparison of the rates of substitution in genes in the melanocortin receptor family indicates that MC1R has evolved the fastest, In addition, the nucleotide diversity at the MC1R locus is shown to be several rimes higher than the average nucleotide diversity in human populations, possibly due to diversifying selection."
"Diet of the brown mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus) in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar","['Atsalis, S']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1020518419038,APR 1999,45,"The conventional notion is that small-bodied primates should be highly insectivorous in order to obtain protein and other nutrients from a food source that is more easily digestible than plant matter. I studied feeding behavior of Microcebus rufus for IG months in the east coast rainforest of Ranomafana National Park. I determined the diet primarily through analysis of 334 fecal samples from live-trapped individuals, They consumed a mixed diet basically of fruit and insects year-round. I identified 24 fruits, while 40-52 remain unidentified. Bakerella, a high-lipid epiphytic semiparasitic plant, was in 58% of fecal samples that contained fruit seeds, and was consumed year-round irrespective of general resource availability? It served both as a staple and keystone resource. Fruit was less frequently totally absent from fecal samples of individual mouse lemurs than insect matter was. For Microcebus rufus, fruit,may be a primary source of energy: not just complementary to insects. Fruit consumption increased in quantity and diversity during the latter part of the rainy season and the very Early part of the dry season, when fruit production was relatively high. This pattern in fruit feeding is similar to that for mouse lemurs in the west coast dry forests and is related to specific nutritional needs dictated by the highly seasonal character of the life cycle. Coleoptera were present in 67% of samples examined a,ld were consumed year-round by the subjects, but insect consumption did not increase during the rainy season when insect abundance was highest."
Can memory requirements account for species' differences in invisible displacement tasks?,"['de Blois, ST', 'Novak, MA', 'Bond, M']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-ANIMAL BEHAVIOR PROCESSES,10.1037//0097-7403.25.2.168,APR 1999,21,"We tested the hypothesis that poor performance on the Piagetian invisible displacement task is related to increased memory requirements. Rhesus monkeys and orangutans received 3 types of problems (invisible, visible, and no transfer problems) each containing a number of steps equivalent to that of standard invisible displacements. if failure to solve invisible displacements was due to increased memory requirements, then the primates should perform at chance level on all 3 problems. However, rhesus monkeys solved visible and no transfer problems, but not invisible transfer problems. Half of the orangutans solved all 3 transfer problems, although their performance on invisible transfer problems was lower than that on the other problems. A subsequent cuing phase led to improved performance, and a few monkeys solved invisible transfer problems."
"A human endogenous retrovirus-like (HERV) LTR formed more than 10 million years ago due to an insertion of HERV-H LTR into the 5 ' LTR of HERV-K is situated on human chromosomes 10, 19 and Y","['Lapuk, AV', 'Khil, PP', 'Lavrentieva, IV', 'Lebedev, YB', 'Sverdlov, ED']",JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY,NA,APR 1999,4,"A chimeric long terminal repeat (LTR) containing the whole LTR of a human endogenous retroviruslike element of the H family (HERV-H) inserted downstream of the core enhancer region of the 5' LTR of a HERV-K retroelement was detected and sequenced in the human 19p12 locus, known to be enriched with genes encoding zinc finger proteins. Similar chimeras were also detected in human chromosomes 10 and Y in human-hamster hybrid cells containing individual human chromosomes. This finding was interpreted as evidence of transpositions of the chimera in the genome. PCR analyses detected the chimera in the genomes of chimpanzee and gorilla, but not in that of orangutan. These data demonstrate that the chimera appeared in the primate germ cells more than 10 million years ago, before divergence of the human/chimpanzee and the gorilla lineages. The combination of the two LTRs forms a new regulatory system that can be involved in nearby gene expression."
Patterns of sexual dimorphism in the hominoid distal humerus,"['Lague, MR', 'Jungers, WL']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1998.0274,APR 1999,11,"Basic biomechanical principles predict that body size differences and differences in the positional behavior of primates should impact on the design of the locomotor skeleton. Allometric distortions in joint shape might be expected between sexes if the degree of body size dimorphism is substantial and/or if sex-specific differences exist in behavior. Nevertheless, there are few documented cases of sexual dimorphism in the limb joints of hominoids, despite substantial body size dimorphism and some reports of intersexual differences in positional behavior. This study re-examines sexual dimorphism in the hominoid distal humerus using coordinate data, and distinguishes explicitly between degree of dimorphism (i.e., the magnitude of intersexual differences) and pattern of dimorphism (i.e., the nature of these differences).

Using a variety off multivariate morphometric methods (e.g., canonical variates analysis of Mosimann shape variables; Euclidean Distance Matrix Analysis of both form and pattern difference matrices), we address the following issues: (1) do males and females of different species and subspecies (or ethnic groups for humans) maintain similar joint shapes? (2) are multiple patterns of dimorphism evident in this region of hominoids? (3) are differences and similarities in degree and pattern predicted by phylogenetic propinquity and positional behavior?

For the most part, our results support earlier findings that sexual dimorphism in the shape of the anthropoid elbow is slight. Of the eight taxa considered here, only the western lowland gorillas exhibited significant differences in the shape of the distal humerus. Gorilla gorilla gorilla also displays a significantly different pattern of dimorphism from the orang-utan. Pattern differences between Andaman Islanders and both mountain gorillas and the orang-utan also approach statistical significance (P<0.06 and P<0.08, respectively). Overall, and despite marked differences in the degree of dimorphism, the knuckle-walking African apes are more similar in patterns of dimorphism to each other than to other taxa (e.g., gorillas are more similar to orang-utans in degree, but more similar to chimpanzees and bonobos in pattern). We could find no definitive ""human pattern"" in our results and suspect that this is because human upper limbs face less stringent mechanical constraints since they are relieved of locomotor stresses (but we cannot rule out the possibility of undocumented differences among our human groups in sex-specific, work-related activities). We anticipate finding additional pattern differences among anthropoids in articular dimorphism as we add other taxa to our sample (including fossil hominids), and examine other joint systems.

Recognizing species diversity among large-bodied hominoids: a simulation test using missing data finite mixture analysis,"['Kramer, A', 'Konigsberg, LW']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1998.0278,APR 1999,14,"A persistent problem in paleoanthropology is the recognition of intra-vs. inter-specific differences within fossil samples. Exacerbating this situation is the often fragmentary nature of the fossils themselves, thus precluding rote applications of many multivariate approaches designed for complete case analyses. In this paper we apply finite mixture analysis to samples of large-bodied hominoids to test this procedure's efficacy in clustering individuals by species without a priori knowledge of group membership. In addition, we stochastically remove individual specimens and measurements,, simulating small, incomplete fossil samples, and re-apply the finite mixture procedure to test how often it correctly assigns these ""fragmentary"" specimens.

Finite mixture analysis can be highly accurate, even when confronted with small sample sizes and missing data. For example, a combination of 124 chimpanzees and humans are correctly identified in one analysis, and the accuracy drops only 2% to become 98% when the total sample size is reduced to 16 and missing data patterns are applied. In comparisons to better known methods that have been used to recognize groups in the fossil record, such as k-means, the benefits of finite mixture analysis are readily apparent. First, k-means is unable to accommodate missing data, an obvious deficiency when investigating the fossil record. Second, in direct comparisons of their ability to accurately assign ""unknowns"" to taxa, finite mixture performed at least as well as, and often better than, k-means in our analyses. A potential test that can be used to identify species in the fossil record, derived from comparisons of results generated from a general vs. a restricted (isometry-corrected) finite mixture analysis, is presented.

Feeding ecology of a large social antelope in the rainforest,"['Klaus-Hugi, C', 'Klaus, G', 'Schmid, B', 'Konig, B']",OECOLOGIA,10.1007/s004420050763,APR 1999,9,"We studied the feeding ecology of the bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus) in the Dzanga National Park in the rainforest of the Central African Republic to understand better the trade-off between food selectivity, ranging behaviour and social organization of a large, forest-dwelling, social antelope. Food plants and vegetation types were registered along a 311-km route travelled by bongos. Food availability was determined by identifying and counting the plants in 19 randomly chosen forest plots. Bongos showed pronounced selectivity for 26 out of 100 woody forest species. They predominantly consumed younger leaves, which suggests that high protein and low fibre content influence plant choice. In addition to leaves, bongos also ate fruits of two and flowers of one species. Furthermore, the diet was supplemented by grasses and herbs consumed on large natural licks. Such licks were regularly visited by the bongos. According to Jarman's ecological classification of antelopes. selective browsers are relatively small and live alone or in pairs to avoid competition over food. The bongo's large size and gregariousness should not allow it.to survive in the rainforest as a pure selective browser. Our data suggest that the bongo relies on the opportunity to graze in bulk which it finds on the natural licks. We hypothesize that such licks either limit the distribution of bongos in other rainforest areas or allow larger group sizes than in areas without licks."
Relative orbitonasal overlap in African great apes and humans quantified by the automatic determination of horizontal and vertical lines of reference,"['Schmittbuhl, M', 'Le Minor, JM', 'Schaaf, A']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557554,APR 1999,2,"The relative positions of the orbital and nasal openings in African apes and humans were studied by a new methodological approach based on the automatic determination, by image analysis techniques, of horizontal and vertical lines of reference. The material used consisted of Gorilla gorilla (38 males and 20 females), Part troglodytes (19 males and 13 females), and modern Homo sapiens (51 males and 41 females). This allowed the relative positions of the orbital and nasal openings to be quantified by the determination of medio-lateral and vertical orbitonasal indices of overlap. In all the species studied, a medio-lateral orbitonasal overlap was systematically observed. This indicates that nasal breadth is always larger than interorbital distance. Medio-lateral overlap was greatest in Gorilla, reduced in Homo, and intermediate in Part. By contrast, only Homo presents systematically a vertical overlap; a vertical overlap was sometimes observed in Pan, but never in Gorilla. Homo presented the greatest vertical overlap, and Gorilla the least; the disposition in Pan was intermediate. The interspecific study of the relationships between medio-lateral and vertical overlap in Gorilla, Part, and Homo demonstrated that an increase in vertical overlap was correlated with a decrease of medio-lateral overlap. Sexual dimorphism in orbitonasal relationships was systematically greatest in Gorilla, and reduced in Pan and Homo, this is also the case for the orbital, nasal, and orbitonasal parameters measured in this study. All these results provide interesting elements for understanding the morphological evolution of the middle face in hominoids."
Infanticide in chimpanzees: Review of cases and a new within-group observation from the Kanyawara study group in Kibale National Park,"['Arcadi, AC', 'Wrangham, RW']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557557,APR 1999,44,"A prolonged attack on a mother and 2-year-old infant that resulted in the death of the infant was observed in the Kanyawara study group in Kibale National Park. The mother was a border-area resident who was first observed associating with unit-group males six years previously. The attackers were an adult male and an adult female with a 6-week-old infant clinging ventrally to her. The attack was unusual in several respects: it is the first time a male and a female chimpanzee have been observed cooperating closely in an infanticidal attack; the adult female initially attempted to intervene in the victim's behalf, but later joined in the attack after receiving aggression from the male; and the episode was longer in duration than other reported cases. In the year following the incident, the mother did not increase her association with community males, but was seen with the male who killed her infant. The relevance of these observations to sexual selection-based explanations for infanticide in chimpanzees is discussed."
"Tree structure and sex differences in arboreality among western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic","['Remis, MJ']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557560,APR 1999,34,"The aim of six months of research in 1995 on the gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic, was to study the effects of tree structure, relative numbers of arboreal feeding sites, and sex differences in body size on arboreal foraging. The analysis presented here also documents inter-annual variation in fruit availability and climbing by silverback gorillas by comparing the 1995 results to those from earlier research, 1990-1992. This analysis suggests that female gorillas maintain similar levels of arboreality in fruit-rich and fruit-poor seasons and years, but silverbacks may be more terrestrial when fruit is scarce or difficult to access. Trees of different shapes present different numbers of feeding sites to bigger males and smaller females. Male climbing is affected by the availability of fruit, and small trees with narrow crowns that lend easy access to fruit from the core. This study suggests that the energetics of vertical climbing and biomechanical constraints imposed by small branch feeding sites in the periphery of trees may constrain the arboreal behavior of male gorillas. Fine-tuned comparisons of food availability, tree structure, and variation in social context of behavior across habitats, will assist efforts to understand differences in ecology among populations and species of African apes."
Growth changes in measurements of upper facial positioning,"['May, R', 'Sheffer, DB']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199903)108:3<269::AID-AJPA3>3.0.CO;2-0,MAR 1999,9,"Growth changes in the position of the midline upper face are examined for samples of Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and modern humans. Horizontal and vertical distances between nasion and the anterior end of the cribriform plate are plotted against stage of dental development. Kendall's nonparametric correlations between facial positioning and stage of dental development are tested for significance.

In African apes, the upper face becomes more projecting and positioned higher relative to the anterior cranial base. The extent of this horizontal and vertical separation reflects primarily facial size. In modern humans, the upper face becomes more projecting but is relatively stable in its vertical position. Comparison of Pan and modern human crania in the youngest dental age category indicates that the upper face of modern humans is positioned lower early in postnatal life.

The position of the upper face (glabella) relative to the anterior and posterior cranial base is presented for several fossil hominid crania. The fossil crania are similar to Pan and modern humans in facial projection relative to the anterior cranial base. However, glabella is positioned low in the fossil crania. Total facial projection (relative to hormion) for Sts 5 is similar to the mean for Gorilla. Fossil Homo and robust australopithecine crania display very projecting upper faces. We suggest that the upper face of Homo is projecting due to the length of the anterior cranial fossa, while robust australopithecines possess a thick frontal bone. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

By diffusing through extracellular matrices more efficiently than TGF beta-FMs, noggin may have a principal role in creating morphogenic gradients2. During mouse embryogenesis, Nog is expressed at multiple sites(3), including developing bones(4,5). Nog(-/-) mice die at birth from multiple defects that include bony fusion of the appendicular skeleton(3,4). We have identified five dominant human NOG mutations in unrelated families segregating proximal symphalangism (SYM1; OMIM 185800) and a de novo mutation in a patient with unaffected parents. We also found a dominant NOG mutation in a family segregating multiple synostoses syndrome (SYNS1; OMIM 186500); both SYM1 and SYNS1 have multiple joint fusion as their principal feature(6,7). All seven NOG mutations alter evolutionarily conserved amino CI acid residues. The findings reported here confirm that NOG is essential for joint formation and suggest that NOG requirements during skeletogenesis differ between species and between specific skeletal elements within species."

Analysis of human FRG1 ESTs showed many of them to be non-processed pseudogenes dispersed throughout the genome. To determine when the amplification of FRG1 occurred, we used a PCR-based approach to identify FRG1 sequences from great apes, chimpanzee, gorilla and orang-utan, and an Old World monkey, Macaca mulatta. In common with humans, multiple copies of FRG1 were detected in the great apes. However, in Macaca mulatta, only two FRG1 loci were identified, one presumed to be the homologue of the human chromosome 4q gene. This is strikingly similar to the distribution of a dispersed 3.3-kb repeat family in primates. A member of this family, D4Z4, maps to the subtelomeric region of 4q, in close proximity to FRG1. We propose that an ancestral duplication of distal 4q included FRG1. This duplication is present in Macaca mulatta whose divergence from hominoids is thought to have occurred at least 33 million years ago. We propose that this telomeric region then underwent further amplification and dispersion events in the great ape lineage, with copies of FRG1 and the 3.3-kb repeats being localized in heterochromatic regions.

Gorilla RH-like genes and antigens","['Apoil, PA', 'Roubinet, F', 'Blancher, A']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s002510050471,FEB 1999,7,"It has been previously shown that most of the human IgG monoclonal D-specific antibodies define a polymorphism in the gorilla consisting of two phenotypes: D-gor-positive and D-gor-negative. By quantitative indirect immunofluorescence assay and quantitative immunoblotting it was evaluated that the number of D-gor antigenic sites per gorilla red cell varies from a level equivalent to that observed for human RhD positive cells to a level eight times higher. By immunoblotting with a rabbit reagent specific for the carboxylic end of human Rh-polypeptides it was demonstrated that RBCs from all gorillas, whatever their D-gor phenotype, possess 33000 relative molecular mass Rh-like polypeptides. The expression of the D-gor antigen was shown to be associated with the presence of three polymorphic bands defined by Southern blot using a human exon 4 RHCE probe, and to a length polymorphism of gorilla intron 3 evidenced by polymerase chain reaction. By contrast, the expression of the D-gor antigen was not associated to the length polymorphism of gorilla intron 4 which is related to the presence or absence of an Alu-Sx element in intron 4, paralleling the situation observed in human. These results confirmed the presence in the gorilla genome of at least two RH-like genes, one of which being responsible for D-gor polymorphism. The phylogenesis of the human and gorilla RH genes is discussed in light of the comparison of intron 4 sequences."
Phylogenetic history of hominoid DRB loci and alleles inferred from intron sequences,"['Bergstrom, TF', 'Erlandsson, R', 'Engkvist, H', 'Josefsson, A', 'Erlich, HA', 'Gyllensten, U']",IMMUNOLOGICAL REVIEWS,10.1111/j.1600-065X.1999.tb01404.x,FEB 1999,32,"The evolutionary relationships among the MHC class II DRB4, DRB5 and DRB6 loci as well as the allelic Lineages and alleles of the DRB1 locus were studied based on intron 1 and intron 2 sequences from humans, chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), bonobo (Pan paniscus) and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). The phylogenetic trees for these sequences indicate that most of the DRB1 allelic lineages predate the separation of the hominoid species studied, consistent with previous analysis of the coding sequences of these lineages. However, the intron sequence variation among alleles within DRB1 allelic lineages is very limited, consistent with the notion that the majority of the contemporary alleles have been generated within the last 250,000 years. The clustering of the DRB1 allelic lineages *08 and *12 with *03 supports a common ancestry for the DR8 and DR52 haplotypes. Similarly, the clustering of DRB1 allelic lineages *15 and *01 with the DRB3 locus is consistent with a common ancestry for the DR1 and DR51 haplotypes. Two cases of recombination around the second exon were observed: 1) the HLA-DRB6 locus appears to have been generated through a recombination between a DRB5 allele and an ancestral DRB6 allele, and 2) the gorilla sequence Gogo-DRB1*03 appears to have been generated through a recombination between the DRB3 locus and an allele from the DRB1*03 allelic Lineage. The nucleotide substitution rate of DRB introns was estimated to 0.85-1.63 x 10(-9) per site per year, based on comparisons between the most closely related sequences from different hominoid species. This estimate is similar to the substitution rate for other intronic regions of the primate genome."
"Ecological constraints on the foraging effort of western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic","['Goldsmith, ML']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1020528115829,FEB 1999,64,"Recent studies demonstrate that western lowland gorillas incorporate much more fruit into their diet than Virunga mountain gorillas do. Very little is known, however about how the frugivorous behavior of western gorillas influences their daily ranging behavior which may ultimately affect social factors such as group size and structure. I examined the influence of diet and the spatiotemporal availability of plant foods on the foraging effort of nonhabituated western lowland gorilla groups during 17 months at Bai Hokou in the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African Republic. I determined diet from indirect methods and gorilla plant food availability and spatial distribution from phenology and line transects. Daily path length gives an estimate of foraging effort and was the distance paced, following fresh gorilla trails, from morning to evening nest sites. The availability and distribution of fruit and its consumption by gorillas varied seasonally. When concentrating on fruits, gorillas traveled significantly farther (mean = 3.1 km/day) than when their diet consisted mostly of nonfruit vegetation, such as leaves and woody pith, stems and bark (mean = 2.1 km/day). The amount of herbaceous vegetation in the diet did not vary seasonally and did not influence daily path length. The best environmental predictor of foraging effort was fruit density, or a measure combining both density and spatial pattern: coefficient of dispersion. In addition, when fruit patches were small, path length tended to increase but not significantly. Compared with results of other studies, gorillas at Bai Hokou travel farther (mean = 2.6 km/day) than gorillas in Gabon (mean = 1.7 km/day) and five times farther than mountain gorillas in the Virungas (mean = 0.5 km/day). Increased foraging effort of gorillas in this region, especially during the fruiting season, may have profound effects on group size and structure."
Ontogenetic patterning of skeletal fluctuating asymmetry in rhesus macaques and humans: Evolutionary and developmental implications,"['Hallgrimsson, B']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1020540418554,FEB 1999,32,"I address the question of how fluctuating asymmetry (FA)-the distribution of random deviations from bilateral symmetry-varies ontogenetically in the mammalian skeleton. This question is significant because of the light that such patterns can shed on the causes of variation in developmental stability in bone as well as other structures. Based on large ontogenetic skeletal series of Macaca mulatta and Homo sapiens, I report that the FA variances of skeletal metric traits increase ontogenetically. Coupled with the finding that FA variances also accumulate to greater magnitudes in slower growing mammals, this result is consistent with the hypotheses that FA in bone is primarily caused by (a) cumulative effects of asymmetrical mechanical factors, (b) accumulation of variation in the (local) regulation of growth, or (c) a tendency for bone morphology to drift through undirected remodeling. I discuss the implications of these optional explanations for primate evolution and bone development."
Did knuckle walking evolve twice?,"['Dainton, M', 'Macho, GA']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1998.0265,FEB 1999,43,"Although African great apes share a similar quadrupedal locomotor behaviour, there are marked differences in hand morphology and size between the species. Hence, whilst all three species (two genera) of African ape frequently knuckle walk as adults, debate remains-as to whether this behaviour is derived from a common ancestor or whether it evolved in parallel in chimpanzees and gorillas. This exploratory morphometric study of the sub-adult and adult wrist of these two genera aims to contribute to this debate.

A total of twenty-seven dimensions of the lunate, triquetral, hamate and capitate of sub-adult and adult Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla were analysed in order to determine whether carpal dimensions are generally ontogenetically scaled, and whether differences in growth trajectories, or length of growth, and adult morphologies can be explained by behavioural differences between the two species. Only 56% of all dimensions studied were ontogenetically scaled in subadults and some of these dimensions exhibit differing adult proportions between the two species. In general, the dimensions analysed fell into two categories: Pan and Gorilla either follow the same growth trajectories (Pattern A) or the Pan reduced major axis (RMA) regressions were significantly transposed above those of Gorilla (Pattern B). Additionally, it was found that Gorilla carpals appear to cease growing relatively earlier than those of Pan. While a small number of differences, notably those of the lunate, can be accounted for by differences in behaviour between the species, the majority of differences indicate heterochronic modifications of development during evolution, which correspond to kinematic differences in knuckle walking between the African great apes. In light of morphological, behavioural and ecological data currently available it is parsimonious to suggest that knuckle walking has evolved in parallel in the two lineages.

The members of the RH gene family (RH50 and RH30) followed different evolutionary pathways,"['Matassi, G', 'Cherif-Zahar, B', 'Pesole, G', 'Raynal, V', 'Cartron, JP']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/PL00006453,FEB 1999,42,"The evolution of the RH gene family is characterized by two major duplication events, the first one originating the RH50 and RH30 genes and the second one giving rise to RHCE and RHD, the two paralogous RH30 genes which encode the Rh blood group antigens in human. The new sequence data obtained here for mouse RH50 and RH30 and for macaque RH50 allowed us to compare the evolutionary rates of the two genes and to show that RH50 evolved about 2.6 times more slowly than RH30 at nonsynonymous positions. This result implies that Rh50 proteins were evolutionarily more conserved compared to Rh30 polypeptides, thus being indicative of the functional significance of the former protein in species as distantly related as sponge and human. The duplication event leading to RH50 and RH30 genes was estimated to have occurred between 250 and 346 million years ago. Moreover, we could also estimate that the duplication event producing the RHCE and RHD genes occurred some 8.5 +/- 3.4 million years ago, in the common ancestor of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. Interestingly, this event seems to coincide with the appearance in these species of a G-to-T mutation in the RH50 gene which created a stop codon in the corresponding transcript. This led to an Rh50 C-terminal cytoplasmic domain shorter than that found in orangutan and early primates."

Kutz, along a suspended sediment gradient in the Colorado River below Glen Canyon Dam, Arizona. Suspended sediments ranged from 2.0 mg.L-1 at Lees Ferry (Rkm 0.8) to 4.2 mg.L-1 at Gorilla Island (Rkm 352). There was a 74% decrease in Cladophora biomass along the river transect through Grand Canyon National Park and a significant decrease in filament and cell length, but cell width increased, Similar changes in cell morphology occurred after 19 days when C. glomerata was transplanted from a low suspended sediment site (less than or equal to 2.0 mg L-1) at Lees Ferry to a habitat with high suspended sediments (greater than or equal to 20.0 mg.L-1). Cell length increased and cell width decreased when plants were transplanted back to the low suspended sediment habitat for 24 days. In situ studies with reduced Light in the absence of suspended sediments showed no change in cell morphology. These in situ experiments imply that changes in cell morphology by C. glomerata in waters with high suspended sediments are adjustments in structural integrity to accommodate the abrasive force of suspended particles. Our study suggests that cell dimensions in Cladophora might be too plastic under varying environmental conditions to be used in taxonomic determinations."
Observations on the pollical palmar interosseous muscle (of Henle),"['Susman, RS', 'Nyati, L', 'Jassal, MS']",ANATOMICAL RECORD,NA,FEB 1 1999,7,"Questions about the existence of a ""pollical"" (first) volar interosseous muscle have persisted since its description by Henle in 1858. A survey of current human anatomy texts and atlases reveals that the majority do not recognize a pollical volar interosseous muscle and therefore they identify only three palmar interossei. We examined the thumbs of 20 individuals of African and European origin in the human anatomy lab at University of the Witwatersrand (Johannesburg) and 15 individuals of European ancestry in the anatomy lab at the University at Stony Brook (New York). A pollical palmar interosseous muscle (PPIM) was found in 86% of individuals (17/20 of the Witwatersrand sample; 13/15 of the Stony Brook sample). Here, we offer a definition of the PPIM in an attempt to resolve the long-standing question of its existence and its relationship to the adductor pollicis obliquus and the deep head of flexor pollicis brevis. We suggest that the human hand usually possesses four palmar interossei as well as four dorsal interossei. Anat Rec 254:159-165, 1999. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Resampling methodology (bootstrapping) is used here to establish that A, africanus has a greater craniofacial size range than chimpanzees or modern humans, a range which is best attributed to a moderately high degree of sexual dimorphism. Compared to other fossil hominins, this variation is similar to that of Homo habilis (sensu late) but less than that of A. boisei. The finding of moderately high dimorphism is corroborated by a CV-based estimate and ratios between those specimens considered to be male and those considered to be female. Inferences about the pattern of craniofacial dimorphism in the A. africanus face currently rely on the relationship of morphology and size. Larger specimens, particularly Stw 505, show prominent superciliary eminences and glabellar regions, but in features related in part to canine size, such as the curvature of the infraorbital surface, large and small specimens of A. africanus are similar. In this respect, the pattern resembles that of modern humans more so than chimpanzees or lowland gorillas. A, africanus may also show novel patterns of sexual dimorphism when compared to extant hominines, such as in the form of the anterior pillar. However, males of the species do not exhibit characteristics of more derived hominins, such as A. robustus. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Under exceptional observation conditions we studied a western lowland gorilla population visiting the Maya salt-clearing (north of the Pare national d'Odzala, P.N.O., Congo) over an 8 month period; 36 groups and 18 solitary individuals (a total of 420 individuals) have been identified visiting the clearing, which suggests a high gorilla density in the region. Ninety-six percent of the gorillas entered the clearing in groups. One-male groups had a mean size of 11.2. Ninety percent of solitary individuals were silver-back males. Compared with other populations of both lowland gorillas and mountain gorillas, the Maya population had the highest immature rate and the highest number of infants per female. Ecological correlates that could explain the attractiveness of the Maya clearing are discussed. The present status and the renewal rate of the Maya population indicate the need for further studies and confirm the importance of developing eco-tourism in this region as part of the sustainable park management activities developed by the ECOFAC programme (European Union).

Despite their potential impact, there has been no systematic comparison of different measures of travel distance. We compared three measures of travel distance in 30 min tactual distance of individuals, straight-line distance of individuals, and straight-line distance of groups) and their ratios in a small group and a large group of vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) and between the large group of vervets and a group of patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas) of roughly similar size. The large group of vervets traveled farther than the small group regardless of the measure used, but the ratios of the different measures were not significantly different between those groups. Patas monkeys traveled significantly farther than the large group of vervets regardless of the measure used. In both vervets and patas, straight-line distances of individuals (ISLD) and groups (GSLD) underestimated actual distances traveled by individuals (IAD), but the degree to which they did so differed between species. LAD is more accurate than the other two measures and is preferred for studies of energetics and individual reproductive success, although ISLD or GSLD may be substituted when the ratios of IAD/ISLD or IAD/GSLD do not differ between groups or species. The ratio of IAD/LSLD was larger in vervets than in patas, suggesting that individual vervets meander more over short periods of time than patas. The ratio of ISLD/GSLD was larger in patas than in vervets, suggesting that patas move at angles or across the group's center-of-mass whereas vervets move more consistently along with others in their group. This has implications for the formation of spatial subgroups and alliances within groups. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Effect of auxiliary males on territory ownership in the oribi and the attributes of multimale groups,"['Arcese, P']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1006/anbe.1998.0962,JAN 1999,16,"I observed free-ranging oribi, Ourebia ourebi, in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, to determine whether group formation by males provides evidence for cooperative territory defence, a behaviour that is rare among male vertebrates. Socially dominant males that shared territories with subordinate auxiliary males were replaced by rivals less often than males that defended territories without auxiliary males. Auxiliary males marked territories with preorbital glands, dung and urine, and territories defended by male groups were marked more thoroughly than those defended by single males. Fifteen of 24 (62.5%) auxiliary males whose histories were known were born on territories defended by males that probably were their fathers. But 37.5% of auxiliary males probably were unrelated to dominant males, because male groups also formed when territory owners accepted adult male immigrants as subordinates, and when owners allowed young males to remain philopatric after evicting a male likely to have been the young male's father. All males in groups probably had some mating access to females, but dominant males may have minimized matings of auxiliary males by guarding fertile females. These results suggest that auxiliary male oribi aided dominant males in territory defence, and that dominants traded off the risks of losing matings to auxiliaries, or being overthrown by them, in exchange for a reduction in their chance of being evicted by rival neighbours or immigrants.

Whither primatology? The place of primates in contemporary anthropology,"['Rodman, PS']",ANNUAL REVIEW OF ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1146/annurev.anthro.28.1.311,1999,14,"Primatology in anthropology began with morphological comparisons of primates to reconstruct the evolution of humans. Naturalistic studies started in the mid-twentieth century and contributed to understanding the functions of morphological variations. Today, research in primatology employs the new paradigm of behavioral ecology and sociobiology for analysis and interpretation of variation in behavior and ecology. Grouping and group sizes of primates are explained with reference to effects of predation, defense of resources, and female defense against male infanticide. Primates avoid close consanguineous mating, usually by dispersal of males from the birthplace, though in bonobos and chimpanzees males are philopatric. In many primates, nepotistic relations among females are explained by kin selection operating on the philopatric sex. In chimpanzees, nepotism is dearest among the philopatric males. Sexual dimorphism, dominance hierarchies, intrasexual competition, and particularly infanticide by males are best explained by the action of sexual selection. Comparative studies of primates indicate that the large brains of the genus Homo (enlarged cerebral cortex) evolved after bipedalism and human dental characters and probably depended on high-quality diets. Broad comparative studies have supported the hypothesis that large brains may have evolved in response to complex social environments, but comparisons within the apes only may not support the hypothesis. Although dominant themes of current anthropology are not compatible with the epistemology, theory, or methodology of primate research and interpretation, primate studies fit easily within the future of anthropology as a four-field evolutionary study of the origins of humans and human nature."
Phylogenetic analysis of HERV-K LTR-like elements in primates: presence in some New World monkeys and evidence of recent parallel evolution in these species and in Homo sapiens,"['Kim, HS', 'Wadekar, RV', 'Takenaka, O', 'Hyun, BH', 'Crow, TJ']",ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY,10.1007/s007050050724,1999,4,"Solitary long terminal repeats (LTRs) of the human endogenous retroviruses K family (HERV-K) have been found to be coexpressed with sequences of closely located genes. We identified forty-three HERV-K LTR-like elements in primates (African great apes, two Old World monkeys, and two New World monkeys) and analyzed them along with human-specific HERV-K LTRs. We report detection of HERV-K LTR-like elements from New World monkeys, as represented by the squirrel monkey and the night monkey, for the first time. Analysis revealed a high degree of sequence homology with human-specific HERV-K LTRs. A phylogenetic tree obtained by the neighbor-joining method revealed that five sequence (SMS-1, 2, 5, 6, 7) from the squirrel monkey and three sequences (NM6-4, 5, 9) from the night monkey are more closely related to human-specific HERV-K LTRs than they are to those of apes (the chimpanzee and gorilla) and Old World monkeys (the African green monkey and rhesus monkey). The findings are consistent with the concept the HERV-K LTR-like elements have proliferated independently and recently in the genome of primates, and that such proliferation has been more recent in Homo sapiens and in these representatives of New World monkeys than in some Old World monkeys."

Both DNA probes showed a distinct hybridization pattern with species-specific variations in hominoids. The stepwise differentiation of the integration, amplification, multilocalization, and reduction of the DNAs were observed interspecifically through the seven species examined. The stepwise events allowed us to trace back a phylogenetic divergence of the hominoid at the cytogenetic level. The manifestation of the events revealed that variations of the Y chromosome and acrocentric autosomes were synapomorphic characters in the divergence and those of metacentric autosomes were autapomorphic characters. Multilocalization of rDNA in the hominoid could also be interpreted as a result of translocations in terms of hetero-site crossover followed by a centric fission and formation of an acrocentric chromosome. Based on the observed rearrangements of rDNA and beta-sat DNA, we propose the following chromosomal phylogenetic divergence order in hominoids: gibbon-siamang-orangutan-gorilla-human-chimpanzee-bonobo. Our data provide additional evidence that evolution of the hominoid can be effectively studied using cytogenetic approaches."

Aping our ancestors: Comparative aspects of reproductive ecology,"['Bentley, GR']",EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY,NA,1999,32,"There are many similarities among mammalian species in how ecological factors affect their reproductive potential and individual life histories. One of the most important limiting factors is the availability of sufficient resources to partition among essential growth, maintenance, and eventual reproduction.(1-3) How each mammal juggles these constraints constitutes its unique life history and determines its success as a species. Yet, as Hill and Hurtado(4) recently argued, life-history analyses are rarely applied to human reproduction. In fact, despite the demonstrated significance of adequate nutrition for reproductive performance among most mammalian species that have been studied,(1,3,5) many demographers, and even some biological anthropologists, have resisted the idea that humans, except under extreme famine conditions, might be subject to the same kinds of nutritional constraints that affect other mammals (6-9)."
Recently integrated human Alu repeats: finding needles in the haystack,"['Roy, AM', 'Carroll, ML', 'Kass, DH', 'Nguyen, SV', 'Salem, AH', 'Batzer, MA', 'Deininger, PL']",GENETICA,10.1023/A:1003941704138,1999,65,"Alu elements undergo amplification through retroposition and integration into new locations throughout primate genomes. Over 500,000 Alu elements reside in the human genome, making the identification of newly inserted Alu repeats the genomic equivalent of finding needles in the haystack. Here, we present two complementary methods for rapid detection of newly integrated Alu elements. In the first approach we employ computational biology to mine the human genomic DNA sequence databases in order to identify recently integrated Alu elements. The second method is based on an anchor-PCR technique which we term Allele-Specific Alu PCR (ASAP). In this approach, Alu elements are selectively amplified from anchored DNA generating a display or 'fingerprint' of recently integrated Alu elements. Alu insertion polymorphisms are then detected by comparison of the DNA fingerprints generated from different samples. Here, we explore the utility of these methods by applying them to the identification of members of the smallest previously identified subfamily of Alu repeats in the human genome termed Ya8. This subfamily of Alu repeats is composed of about 50 elements within the human genome. Approximately 50% of the Ya8 Alu family members have inserted in the human genome so recently that they are polymorphic, making them useful markers for the study of human evolution."

The recent isolation of subtelomeric probes specific for human (HSA) chromosomes 1q, 11p, 13q, and 16q has prompted us to cross-hybridize these to the chromosomes of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, PTR), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla, GGO), and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus, PPY) to search for their equivalent locations in the great apes. Hybridization signals to the 1q subtelomeric DNA sequence probe were observed at the termini of human (HSA) 1q, PTR 1q, GGO 1q, PPY 1q, while the fluorescent signals to the 11p subtelomeric DNA sequence probe were observed at the termini of HSA 11p, PTR 9p, GGO 9p, and PPY 8p. Fluorescent signals to the 13q subtelomeric DNA sequence probe were observed at the termini of HSA 13q, PTR 14q, GGO 14q, and PPY 14q, and positive signals to the 16p subtelomeric DNA sequence probe were observed at the termini of HSA 16q, PTR 18q, GGO 17q, and PPY 19q. These findings apparently suggest sequence homology of these DNA families in the ape chromosomes. Obviously, analogous subtelomeric sequences exist in apes' chromosomes that apparently have been conserved through the course of differentiation of the hominoid species."
Dental microwear of Griphopithecus alpani,"['King, T', 'Aiello, LC', 'Andrews, P']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1998.0258,JAN 1999,33,"The examination of microscopic dental wear allows inferences to be made about diet in extinct species. This study reconstructs the diet of Griphopithecus alpani, a 15 Ma fossil hominoid from the Miocene site of Pasalar in north-western Turkey, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the microscopic wear on its molar teeth. The microwear patterns of Griphopithecus are compared with those of three extant. hominoid taxa-Gorilla gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes vents, and Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus. The microwear on three occlusal wear surfaces is examined in this study, and sex and age differences are also included. Analysis of variance is performed on the following microwear variables-feature density, pit density, striation density, the ratio of pits relative to striations, pit widths, and striation widths. Griphopithecus has significantly higher microwear feature densities and higher percentages of pits than Gorilla. It also has larger pit frequencies and narrower striations than both Pan and Gorilla. There are no significant differences between the microwear patterns of Griphopithecus and Pongo. This suggests that the diet of Griphopithecus was more similar to that of Pongo, which consumes mainly fruit, and occasionally hard and unripe fruits and nuts, than to that of Pan and Gorilla. In addition, the high percentage of pits displayed by Griphopithecus may indicate that it was ingesting harder fruits and/or objects than the extant hominoids, although this is not a significant difference.

These fossils probably date to around 3.5 m.y.a. Faunal information suggests that the environment at South Turkwel was predominantly bushland. The mandibular and dental remains are fragmentary, but the postcranial fossils are informative. Comparisons with Australopithecus, modern human, chimpanzee and gorilla hand bones suggest that the Turkwel hominid was most like Australopithecus afarensis and A. africanus. Carpometacarpal articulations are intermediate between those of modern humans and African apes, suggesting enhanced gripping capabilities compared with extant apes. The hamulus was strikingly large, similar in proportion only to Neandertals and some gorillas, suggesting the presence of powerful forearms and hands. There are no indicators of adaptations to knuckle-walking or suspensory locomotion in the hand, and the pedal phalanx suggests that this hominid was habitually bipedal. (C) 1999 Academic Press."
Localization of human midisatellite and macrosatellite DNA sequences on chromosomes 1 and X in the great apes,"['Samonte, RV', 'Conte, RA', 'Verma, RS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s100380050108,1999,4,"The mechanism of speciation has remained largely unresolved, and hominoid evolutionary history based on chromosome rearrangements has been continuously challenged. The recent availability of the human-derived chromosome 1-specific midisatellite (D1Z2) and chromosome X-specific macrosatellite (DXZ4) DNA sequence probes has prompted us to hybridize the aforementioned to the members of the hominoid clade (chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan), using the fluorescence in-situ hybridization technique. Inconsistencies in the hybridization pattern for the D1Z2. DNA probe in the great ape species suggests that changes in this sequence have apparently taken place during the evolutionary process. No hybridization signal was observed in the orangutan chromosome 1, suggesting that a homologous D1Z2 DNA sequence may not be present in its genome, or that the sequence may be altered, rendering itself undetectable by human-derived DNA probes. Homology in the hybridization patterns for the DXZ4 probe in all three ape species illustrates that the sequence is apparently conserved. Such hybridization data provide some level of phylogenetic information on the recent ancestry of higher primates."
"Gorillas and seed dispersal in the Lope Reserve, Gabon. I: Gorilla acquisition by trees","['Voysey, BC', 'McDonald, KE', 'Rogers, ME', 'Tutin, CEG', 'Parnell, RJ']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,10.1017/S0266467499000656,JAN 1999,25,"Recent studies have shown that western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla Savage & Wyman) are highly frugivorous and expel in their dung viable seeds of many fruit species they consume. As part of a wider study of their role as seed dispersers in tropical rain forest, the importance of gorillas as consumers of three species of tropical tree was investigated. The species studied were Ganophyllum giganteum (Sapindaceae), Cola lizae (Sterculiaceae) and Uapaca guineensis (Euphorbiaceae). Gorillas swallowed large quantites of seeds of these species whenever they were available, and removed a considerable proportion of the crop from trees they visited. The differences in abundance and distribution of these trees, and their varied dispersal strategies influenced the quantity of seeds that was removed by gorillas. Uapaca can be seen as having a generalist fruiting strategy, with a wide range of consumers, whereas the other species are more specialist, gorillas being the principal dispersers. Compared to other consumers, this study showed that gorillas provided potentially high quality dispersal because: (i) they were reliable visitors to trees of these species; (ii) they swallowed and dispersed large numbers of seeds; (iii) they treated seeds benignly and often deposited them in sites favourable for establishment."

The survival and growth of seedlings of three tree species, growing from dung deposited at gorilla nest sites, were monitored for up to 2 y after deposition. A comparison was made between this and seeds (i) deposited in dung on gorilla feeding trails, (ii) dropped (spat out) under conspecific canopies, and (iii) scatter-dispersed (spat out) by other consumers away from conspecific trees but under intact forest canopy. The highest survival and the best performance of seedlings was always at a gorilla nest site, although not every site was favourable for survival or growth. Seedling performance was related to the surrounding vegetation conditions: better performance was observed in seedling clumps with less vegetation cover. Gorillas at Lope apparently provide high quality seed dispersal for these species, not just because they consume large quantities of seeds, but because the pattern of seed deposition, especially in nest sites, can result in the enhanced survival and growth of seedlings."
Development of a competitive ELISA for detection of primates infected with monkey B virus (Herpesvirus simiae),"['Blewett, EL', 'Saliki, JT', 'Eberle, R']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS,NA,JAN 1999,11,"Two competitive ELISAs (C-ELISAs) are described that allow detection of antibodies against monkey B virus (BV, Cercercopithecine herpesvirus 1). The assays utilize monoclonal antibodies (MABs) directed against the BV glycoprotein B (gB). Two of these MABs specifically recognize BV gB while a third MAB also reacts with the gB homologues of other primate alpha-herpesviruses (herpes simplexvirus-1, HSV-1; HSV-2; simian agent-8, SA8; and Herpesvirus papio-2, HVP2). A C-ELISA using the single cross-reactive MAB 3E8 allowed detection of host antibodies against HSV-1, HSV-2, SA8, HVP2 or BV, thus proving to be a sensitive assay for the detection of infection by any of these primate alpha-herpesviruses. The C- ELISA using BV-specific MABs was less sensitive but did allow some discrimination between infection by BV versus other alpha-herpesviruses. It was also shown that a C-ELISA using HVP2 as antigen and the cross-reactive MAB 3E8 was as sensitive for detection of BV antibody in macaque sera as an assay employing BV antigen. This test format allows detection of BV-infected primates without the biohazards associated with preparation and use of BV antigen. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
Studies on karyotype evolution in higher primates in relation to human chromosome 14 and 9 by comparative mapping of immunoglobulin C epsilon genes with fluorescence in situ hybridization.,"['Tanabe, H']",Kokuritsu Iyakuhin Shokuhin Eisei Kenkyujo hokoku = Bulletin of National Institute of Health Sciences,NA,1999,0,"Karyotypic homologies in relation to human chromosome 14 and 9 were studied through comparative mapping of the immunoglobulin C epsilon genes in higher primates by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique. The C epsilon genes will be suitable probes for the analysis of evolutionary rearrangements due to that the multiple recombinational events such as gene duplications and deletions have occurred repeatedly in the immunoglobulin CH gene family (IGH@) during the course of primate evolution. IGH@ locating on the terminal region of human chromosome 14 (HSA14), at band HSA14q32.33, has generated multiple pseudogenes and among subclasses of IGH@ the C epsilon genes have shown most dynamic changes with generating both truncated type (C epsilon 2) and processed type (C epsilon 3) pseudogenes. In this study, chromosomal homologies and rearrangements on HSA14 (C epsilon 1) and HSA9 (C epsilon 3) in relation to the evolutionary genesis of their primate homologous chromosomes in speciation were investigated by comparative mapping with FISH and chromosome painting (ZOO-FISH) techniques. Comparative mapping of the C epsilon 1 gene at HSA14q32.33 was carried out in seven species of nonhuman primates: common chimpanzee (PTR), pygmy chimpanzee (PPA), gorilla (GGO), orangutan (PPY), white-handed gibbon (HLA), agile gibbon (HAG), and Japanese macaque (MFU). The C epsilon 1 gene was assigned to the telomeric region of HSA14 homologues in each species, namely, PTR15q32, PPA15q32, GGO18q16, PPY15q32, HLA17qter, HAG17qter, and MFU7q29, respectively. These results suggested that HSA14 has high degree of syntenic organization with its primate homologues confirmed by ZOO-FISH. Concerning HSA9, comparative mapping of the C epsilon 3 gene at HSA9p24.2-->p24.1 was performed. The mapped positions indicated the HSA9 homologous regions detected by ZOO-FISH in each species, namely, PTR11q34, PPA11q34, GGO13q22, PPY13q16, HLA8qter, HAG8qter, and MFU14q22, respectively, suggesting that several dynamic chromosomal rearrangements including at least twice pericentric inversions have occurred during the course of hominoid evolution. The comparison of syntenic groups and painting results has provided a hypothesis of the evolutionary genesis of HSA9 and its homologues with defined breakpoints on the present chromosomes. Likewise, studies on karyotype evolution will be promoted by combining comparative mapping with ZOO-FISH that can more clearly define the chromosomal rearrangements among species."
Gorillas in our midst: sustained inattentional blindness for dynamic events,"['Simons, DJ', 'Chabris, CF']",PERCEPTION,10.1068/p2952,1999,627,"With each eye fixation, we experience a richly detailed visual world. Yet recent work on visual integration and change direction reveals that we are surprisingly unaware of the details of our environment from one view to the next: we often do not detect large changes to objects and scenes ('change blindness'). Furthermore, without attention, we may not even perceive objects ('inattentional blindness'). Taken together, these findings suggest that we perceive and remember only those objects and details that receive focused attention. In this paper, we briefly review and discuss evidence for these cognitive forms of 'blindness'. We then present a new study that builds on classic studies of divided visual attention to examine inattentional blindness for complex objects and events in dynamic scenes. Our results suggest that the likelihood of noticing an unexpected object depends on the similarity of that object to other objects in the display and on how difficult the priming monitoring task is. Interestingly, spatial proximity of the critical unattended object to attended locations does not appear to affect detection, suggesting that observers attend to objects and events, not spatial positions. We discuss the implications of these results for visual representations and awareness of our visual environment."
Socioecological factors influencing population structure of gorillas and chimpanzees,"['Yamagiwa, J']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557704,JAN 1999,33,"Differences in distribution and density between gorillas and chimpanzees are reconsidered with special reference to population structure. Both ecological and social factors influencing population structure are compared between species and between habitats within species. Gorillas and chimpanzees respond differently to a decline in food quality, such as fruit scarcity: gorillas change diet and decrease range, while chimpanzees do not change diet but may expand range. These responses result in different effects on their grouping patterns. For gorillas the dispersed distribution and reduction of range size decreases the rate of inter-unit encounters and female transfer. The concentration of social units increases the rate of aggressive contact between units and stimulates female transfer. Social units of gorillas may crowd or disperse in order to attain the optimal density. This tendency may result in similar densities of gorillas across habitats. By contrast, the distribution patterns or range size may not affect inter-unit relationships of chimpanzees. Within a single unit-group, various reproductive strategies are adopted by both sexes. Independent travel of females and flexible grouping patterns enable them to survive at very low density in extraordinary large ranges. Density and inter-unit relationships are good criteria for a healthy population of gorillas, while the size of unit-group and inter-individual relationships are good criteria for chimpanzees. Conservation planners should consider these differences for sympatric and allopatric survival in these species."
"Variation in langur social organization in relation to the socioecological model, human habitat alteration, and phylogenetic constraints","['Sterck, EHM']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557711,JAN 1999,20,"The socioecological model is to date the best evolutionary model to explain variation in primate behaviour. Some species or populations, however, deviate from the predictions. These deviations may be due to a disequilibrium between evolutionary causes and behavioural adaptations, caused by recent human changes of the environment. The relationship between human habitat alteration and primate social behaviour is reviewed and investigated for langurs. Provisioning affects the spatial distribution of food. In these areas, but also in areas with natural monopolizable food sources, female dominance relationships are linear, but not nepotistic. This does not fit into the evolutionary model. Provisioning also affects the temporal distribution of food. This reduces the seasonality of mating, increases female monopolizability and gives rise to more one-male groups than in undisturbed areas. A human reduction of the number of predators leads to fewer males per group. It also results in female philopatry. Infanticide risk was higher in disturbed than in undisturbed areas. This was not caused by the lower proportion of one-male groups in disturbed areas, but by the lack of female dispersal. Thus, female behaviour was affected by human habitat disturbance in a way that does not fit the socioecological model. However, the extension of habitat disturbance does not explain all results. We could say that the model is refuted. Phylogenetic constraints, however, do explain the behaviour of despotic Hanuman langurs. Such phylogenetic constraints complement the socioecological model. To understand the evolutionary history of a current set of features, these two approaches should be studied simultaneously."
"Fragmented living: Behavioural ecology of primates in a forest fragment in the Lope Reserve, Gabon","['Tutin, CEG']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557714,JAN 1999,73,"A 17-month study was made of the primates using a 9-ha ""island"" of forest, surrounded by savanna, in the northern part of the Lope Reserve, Gabon. One group of Cercopithecus cephus (plus a young male Cercopithecus nictitans who was in permanent association with them) were resident in the fragment and groups of five other species of primates made visits during 127 days of observation: Pan troglodytes, 15 visits; Cercocebus albigena, 10; Colobus satanas, 3; Cercopithecus nictitans, 2; C. pogonias, 1. Visits were also made by lone males of three species, C. nictitans, Cercocebus albigena, and Mandrillus sphinx. The eighth species of diurnal primate present at Lope, Gorilla g. gorilla, did not visit the fragment during the study. Compared to conspecific groups in neighbouring continuous forest, primates in the fragment ate less fruit, seeds, and flowers and more insects and leaves. The local population density of primates resident in the fragment was equivalent to that of the neighbouring continuous forest where all eight species occur, despite the diversity and abundance of fruit being less in the fragment. The costs imposed on the resident group by the reduced diversity and availability of preferred fruit foods appeared to be offset by a number of benefits that increased individual feeding efficiency for monkeys residing within a single fragment. These included lower travel costs, reduced feeding competition between individuals through group fission, and excellent knowledge of the location and quality of food resources in the small home range. It is also possible that the overall negative impact of inter-specific feeding competition was lower in fragments than in continuous forest and that micro-habitat differences resulted in an increased availability of palatable insect and leaf fallback foods in the fragment."

Social interactions between captive adult male and infant lowland gorillas: Implications regarding kin selection and zoo management,"['Enciso, AE', 'Calcagno, JM', 'Gold, KC']",ZOO BIOLOGY,NA,1999,0,"Interactions between unrelated and related silverback-infant dyads are compared in an attempt to assess the influence that kinship may have on male parental behavior. Observational data were collected on each member of two silverback-infant dyads, in two separate enclosures at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, IL. The silverback was the father of the infant in one dyad, and unrelated to the infant in the other. Each infant was responsible for initiating most of the encounters with its respective group silverback. However, based on the frequency and duration of interactions, there is a significantly higher degree of affiliation and tolerance within the silverback-offspring dyad. Furthermore, the unrelated infant was the recipient of more than 40% of the agonistic behaviors exhibited by the silverback, whereas no such encounters were recorded within the related dyad. Although alternative explanations must be considered, these findings are consistent with kin selection theory, are similar to observations documented for wild mountain gorillas, and provide uncommon comparative data on adult male interactions with related and unrelated infants. In addition, this study offers behavioral information relevant to the management of captive gorillas, which often requires the introduction of immatures into non-natal groups.

Changes in nearest-neighbor associations in a captive group of western lowland gorillas after the introduction of five hand-reared infants,"['McCann, CM', 'Rothman, JM']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1098-2361(1999)18:4<261::AID-ZOO2>3.0.CO;2-Q,1999,6,"The successful. management of a captive gorilla population often necessitates the hand-rearing of infants and their subsequent re-integration into social groups of conspecifics. In the present study we quantified the changes in nearest-neighbor associations in a group consisting of a silverback male, three adult females, and two sub-adult females after the introduction of five hand-reared infants. Additionally, we examined the associations among kin and non-kin group members to determine whether genetic relatedness was a factor influencing the integration of the infants into the group and the subsequent patterns of association among infants and adults. Results showed that after the introduction, the silverback male spent >60% of his time in close proximity to an infant and 10% of his time within a ""cluster"" of infants. There was a significant,change in a female's nearest-neighbor associations; however, the change did not include an infant. The most significant finding among infants was a strong bias by each to associate with another infant. When the infants associated with an adult, three of the five associated most with the silverback male (P < 0.001), whereas the other two infants distributed their time among all the adults. The most significant change in behavior patterns was exhibited by one of the sub-adult females who displayed parental behaviors 18% of the time compared to <1% for all other females. Adults and one sub-adult female associated significantly more often with related infants compared to unrelated infants (P < 0.025), and the infants showed a bias to associate with another related infant (P < 0.0001). Results of an infant's association with an adult showed that three of the five infants preferred to associate with a related adult (P < 0.0001). An individual's age, sex, and behavioral profile may have also influenced association patterns among group members. These findings lend strong support to the importance of peer groups and the presence of a silverback male for facilitating the integration of hand-reared infants into established adult groups.

Dosage trials with transmucosal carfentanil citrate in non-human primates,"['Kearns, KS', 'Swenson, B', 'Ramsay, EC']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1098-2361(1999)18:5<397::AID-ZOO4>3.0.CO;2-U,1999,2,"The traditional method of immobilizing non-human primates involves remote-delivery injection of anesthetic agents. Orally delivered, transmucosally absorbed opioids have been shown to be a non-stressful alternative method of pre-anesthetic drug administration in children and adults [Stanley et al., 1989]. This report describes several cases using transmucosal carfentanil in non-human primates to determine whether orally delivered carfentanil can be a safe, less stressful, and reversible method of sedation in these species. Regimen 1: Transmucosal carfentanil alone. Three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), two capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella), and two gibbons (Hylobates lar) were given carfentanil citrate as their sole pre-medication agent. Doses ranged from 2.0 to 4.0 mu g/kg. After a median time of 22 minutes, all chimpanzees were nearly or completely immobilized and showed signs of severe respiratory depression. In contrast, the gibbons and capuchins showed moderate to profound sedation and no signs of respiratory depression. Regimen 2: Oral droperidol followed by transmucosal carfentanil. Four chimpanzees and two bonobos (Pan paniscus) were given a dose of 2.5 mg droperidol orally 45 minutes before transmucosal carfentanil administration. Two chimpanzees received 1.0 mu g/kg carfentanil, and all other animals in this trial received a dose of 2.0 mu g/kg. All individuals were nearly or completely immobilized with this protocol, and respiratory depression was much less severe. Regimen 3: Oral droperidol followed by transmucosal carfentanil for euthanasia. Two western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) were electively euthanized using oral droperidol followed by transmucosal carfentanil. Droperidol was administered as in Regimen 2, and doses of carfentanil were 14 mu g/kg in the case of a developmentally disabled young gorilla, and 2 mu g/kg for a severely debilitated geriatric gorilla with severe respiratory and cardiac disease. Respiratory arrest occurred at 12 and 10 minutes, respectively after carfentanil administration, with subsequent cardiac arrest. Transmucosal carfentanil appears promising as an anesthetic agent when administered alone to gibbons and capuchin monkeys, when administered in combination with droperidol to chimpanzees and bonobos, and when administered for purposes of elective euthanasia in gorillas. Administration of transmucosal carfentanil alone for immobilization of chimpanzees is not recommended because of the severity of respiratory depression observed. Zoo Biol 18:397-402, 1999.

The study was conducted using a withdrawal design (BTB), in which a baseline period (B) of 10 days was followed by a treatment period (T) of 10 days, followed by a return to the baseline feeding protocol (B) for 10 days. The experiment was conducted in two phases: first, identifying whether the incidence of R/R was decreased by replacing milk with an equal volume of diluted fruit juice, and second, identifying whether the incidence of R/R was decreased by replacing milk with a smaller volume of undiluted fruit juice. Removal of milk from the diet led to a significant decrease in R/R in both phases and an increase in feeding behavior during the first phase. Seasonal differences in baseline behavior were also observed. The current study provides evidence that removal of milk from the captive gorilla diet may reduce undesirable behaviors such as R/R and may be a step toward better approximating the natural diet for captive gorillas.

The nutritional status of nine captive primate species was examined using biochemical analysis. The species were spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi), colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza), sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus), Schmidt's monkeys (Cercopithecus ascanius), mandrills (Papio sphinx), baboons (Papio cynocephalus), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), and gorillas (Gorrilla gorilla). Diet information was collected by survey and the estimated nutritional composition of the diet for each species at each institution was compared with non-human primate nutrient requirements. On the average, the captive primates received diets that met or exceeded recommended dietary guidelines for vitamins A, D, and E for non-human primates. Blood samples were collected from 94 primates held at Brookfield Zoo, Fort Worth Zoo, Lincoln Park Zoological Gardens, and-North Carolina Zoological Park and analyzed for lipids, vitamins A and E, D metabolites, and carotenoids. Several species showed differences among toes for some nutrients, but values from any one zoo were not consistently lower. When monkeys were compared with great apes, monkeys had lower serum total cholesterol, triacylglyceride, and measured LDL cholesterol levels, but significantly higher vitamin D metabolite levels. Species differences were found for serum A, E, and carotenoid levels (with the exception of lycopene). Some differences were seen in serum retinol, retinyl palmitate and gamma-tocopherol. The relatively large number of animals contributing to this database and the fact that the data were collected from four toes provide a substantial base for comparing nutritional status. Comparisons of these serum levels with previously published values for selected primates and humans revealed some differences. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

This ERV-9 LTR contains an unusual U3 enhancer region composed of 14 tandem repeats with recurrent GATA, CACCC, and CCAAT motifs. This LTR is conserved in human and gorilla, indicating its evolutionary stability in the genomes of the higher primates. In both recombinant constructs and the endogenous human genome, the LTR enhancer and promoter activate the transcription of cis-linked DNA preferentially in erythroid cells.

The brain and communication are basic for clinical human sciences,"['Gardner, R']",BRITISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PSYCHOLOGY,NA,DEC 1998,7,"This article focuses on basic concepts modelled on medical science for the human sciences. This reformulates problems experienced by people who consult counsellors, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and or-her human science clinicians as located in the brain. These troubles can be described as difficulties in social life and human communication, on the one hand, and as varied brain physiology, on the other. These problems and their solutions are not traditionally biological but restrictive views of biology need modification as the brain is obviously the central organ for not only the medical specialities of neurology and psychiatry but for all professionals concerned with social interactions. The human genome determines the brain of each person: each such brain constitutes the latest iteration of ancestral genomes that include species precursor to humans and primates, extending back to unicellular life forms. The genome that determines the human brain confers remarkable flexibility or learning potential. Yet many factors influence what is learned and experienced. Understanding this entails comparing and contrasting humans and non-humans. The genomes of chimpanzees and gorillas differ little from that of humans so most basic plans determining behaviour must be shared. Yet contrasted to these animals, the human brain is three times greater in mass and the human cerebral cortex has four rimes more area. This increased brain correlated with more social interaction; humans are the story-telling animal, producing, consuming and otherwise using small and large tales intensely and incessantly. But do communicational features resemble each other across species! Communicational propensity states in humans compare to those of non-humans. So do those of normal people and psychiatric patients. Psychiatry's efforts at systematic description and nosology provided guidelines to the ethology of ancient but still active communicational propensity states called PSALICs (Gardner, 1988). This double acronym refers to their normal function and prehuman origins; they are defined from a three-legged base in that each exists in psychiatric patients, normal people and non-human animals. This article describes the following psalics: alpha, audience, in-group omega, mating, nurturant, nurturance-eliciting, out-group omega and spacing-avoidant.

Description of two Mhc-C-related sequences in the New World monkey Saguinus oedipus,"['Alvarez-Tejado, M', 'Martinez-Laso, J', 'Garcia-de-la-Torre, C', 'Varela, P', 'Recio, MJ', 'Allende, L', 'Gomez-Casado, E', 'Arnaiz-Villena, A']",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1046/j.1365-2370.1998.00132.x,DEC 1998,4,"Two new Mhc class I partial exon 1, intron 1, exon 2, intron 2 and partial exon 3 DNA sequences from the New World monkey Saguinus oedipus (Saoe) are described. These two sequences show certain Mhc-C sequence-specific changes. The only difference between these two new sequences is a productive substitution at position 152 [GCG (Ala)-->GAG (Glu)]. This change occurs in a position which in Mhc classical class I molecules affects the interaction between the peptide and the T-cell receptor A dendrogram with Mhc sequences from different loci and different species was constructed, which clearly shows that these two new sequences cluster closer to Mhc-C sequences than to others. These data suggest that the new sequences may be related to the Mhc-C locus, and they have been named Mhc-Saoe-CR*01 and -CR*02. However, they share only a few of the conserved residues (from gorilla to human) of Mhc-C sequences, which suggests that the relationships with an ancestor of the Mhc-C lineage are very distant or that these two sequences are products of convergent evolution to perform a C locus related function. Furthermore, in the fragment of DNA sequenced, there is a loss of two invariant residues conserved in antigen-presenting molecules from reptiles to humans; thus, it is unlikely that these two Mhc-C-like sequences have an antigen-presenting function, or even that they are two alleles of a pseudogene; however, the G + C percentage (86.1%) at the third base of codons approaches that of an expressed gene in Saoe. It is concluded that Mhc molecules with C-locus characteristics existed in primates 50 million years ago and that this does not support a more recent origin of Mhc-C genes."
Seasonality in the ecology and life histories of mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei),"['Watts, DP']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1020366018187,DEC 1998,36,"The abundance of food, especially that of fruit and often that of young leaves, varies considerably over time for most primates. This variation can depend on or be independent of seasonality in rainfall. Mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) in the Virungas are exceptional: their habitat contains almost no edible fruit, and they mostly eat perennially available herbs and vines that are densely and evenly distributed in much of their habitat. Earlier studies documented little consistent temporal variation in mountain gorilla diets and habitat use, except for seasonal use of bamboo by some groups, and documented no birth seasonality. Long-term data (less than or equal to 7 years) on 6 mountain gorilla groups confirm these results for habitat use, except that they show some seasonality in use of the upper altitudinal extremes of the gorillas' home ranges for unclear reasons. Relatively low and inconsistent variation in habitat duality over time should lower the costs of grouping for gorillas compared to other apes. Long-term data also confirm the absence of seasonality in births and conceptions. However, they show that mortality rates and risk of respiratory infections vary directly with rainfall. These relationships are probably causal and may be mediated through thermoregulatory stress."
Dietary response of chimpanzees and cercopithecines to seasonal variation in fruit abundance. II. Macronutrients,"['Conklin-Brittain, NL', 'Wrangham, RW', 'Hunt, KD']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1020370119096,DEC 1998,124,"In a continuation of our study of dietary differentiation among frugivorous primates with simple stomachs we present the first comparison of differences in dietary macronutrient content between chimpanzees and cercopithecine monkeys. Previously we have shown that chimpanzee and monkey diets differ markedly in plant part and species content. We now examine whether this diet diversity is reflected in markedly different dietary macronutrient levels or the different feeding strategies yield the same macronutrient levels in their diets. For each primate group we calculated the total weighted mean dietary content of 4 macronutrients: crude lipid (lipid), crude protein (CP), water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), and total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC). We also calculated 4 fiber fractions: neutral-detergent fiber (NDF), which includes the subfractions hemicellulose (HC), cellulose (Cs), and sulfuric acid lignin (Ls). The HC and Cs are potentially fermentable fibers and would contribute to the energy provided by plans food depending on the hind gut fermenting capacity of the individual primate species. The chimpanzee diet contained higher levels of WSC and TNC because during times of fruit abundance the chimpanzees took special advantage of ripe fruit, while the monkeys did not. The monkey diets contained higher levels of CP because the monkeys consumed a constant amount of leaf throughout the year. All four primate species consumed diets with similar NDF levels. However, the chimpanzees also took advantage of periods of ripe fruit abundance to decrease their Ls levels and to increase their HC levels. Conversely, the monkey diets maintained constant levels of the different fiber fractions throughout the year. Nevertheless, despite these differences, the diets of the 4 frugivores were surprisingly similar, considering the substantial differences in body size. We conclude that the chimpanzee diet is of higher quality, particularly of lower fiber content than expected on the basis of their body size."
The influence of alveolar structures on the torsional strain field in a gorilla corporeal cross-section,"['Chen, XB', 'Chen, H']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1998.0251,DEC 1998,13,"Anthropologists have often used mandibular torsional properties to make inferences about primate dietary adaptations. Most of the methods employed are based on assumptions related to periodontal and alveolar properties. This study uses the finite element method to evaluate some of these assumptions with a cross-section through the third molar of a gorilla. Results indicate that the properties of alveolar bone play an important role in determining the strain field. In comparison, the exact stiffness values of the periodontal ligaments seem to have a much smaller impact. Replacing the dental roots and periodontal ligaments with alveolar bone, however, has a significant influence on the strain field. It underestimates the maximum shear strain by about 28% along its periosteal aspect when alveoli are modeled as cortical bone. It overestimates the strain by a smaller amount when alveoli are modeled as trabecular bone.

This study supports the assumption that primate mandibles behave like a closed-section under torsion under the limiting condition that the alveolar bone stiffness is more than half of the value of cortical bone; alveolar bone can then be modeled as cortical bone with a minimal loss of accuracy. In addition, this study suggests that the minimum cortical thickness should be considered fbr torsional strength. Finally, modeling accuracy can be significantly increased if both dental and periodontal structures can be realistically incorporated into mandibular biomechanical models. However, this may not be always feasible in studies of fossil. mandibles. This is due mainly to the difficulties involved in estimating alveolar bone densities and in distinguishing boundaries between cortical bone, alveolar bone, periodontal ligaments, and dental roots in fossil specimens.

Identification of evolutionarily invariant sequences in the protein C gene promoter,"['Spek, CA', 'Bertina, RM', 'Reitsma, PH']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/PL00006424,DEC 1998,5,"Recent studies on human protein C gene expression have revealed the presence of three transcription factor binding sites in close proximity to the transcription start site. Binding sites for the liver-enriched hepatocyte nuclear factors 1 and 3 (HNF-1 and HNF-3, respectively) are located immediately upstream of the transcription start site, whereas just downstream of the start site a presently unidentified transcription factor may bind. To identify other candidate transcription factor binding sites in the protein C promoter, we studied the promoter sequence identity in a number of evolutionarily close and more distant species: Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, Pan troglodytes, Homo sapiens, Cebus apella, Macaca mulatta, Callithrix jacchus, Papio hamadryas, Macaca fascicularis, and Rattus norvegicus. This analysis showed that a high degree of identity (78%) exists among the different primates. Comparison of the primate consensus sequence with the Rattus norvegicus protein C promoter sequence revealed the presence of seven identical regions (I to VII). Two of these regions overlap with established regulatory sequences for HNF-3 and HNF-1 (region VI) and for PCE-1 (region VII), respectively. The functional importance and the transcription factors that may bind to the other five identical regions are now to be determined."
Molecular timing of primate divergences as estimated by two nonprimate calibration points,"['Arnason, U', 'Gullberg, A', 'Janke, A']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/PL00006431,DEC 1998,101,"The complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule of the hamadryas baboon, Papio hamadryas, was sequenced and included in a molecular analysis of 24 complete mammalian mtDNAs. The particular aim of the study was to time the divergence between Cercopithecoidea and Hominoidea. That divergence, set at 30 million years before present (MYBP) was a fundamental reference for the original proposal of recent hominoid divergences, according to which the split among gorilla,chimpanzee, and Homo took place 5 MYBP. In the present study the validity of the postulated 30 MYBP dating of the Cercopithe coidea/Hominoidea divergence was examined by applying two independent nonprimate molecular references, the divergence between artiodactyls and cetaceans set at 60 MYBP and that between Equidae and Rhinocerotidae set at 50 MYBP. After calibration for differences in evolutionary rates, application of the two references suggested that the Cercopithecoidea/Hominoidea divergence took place >50 MYBP. Consistent with the marked shift in the dating of the Cercopithecoidea/Hominoidea split, all hominoid divergences receive a much earlier dating. Thus the estimated date of the divergence between Pan (chimpanzee) and Homo is 10-13 MYBP and that between Gorilla and the Pan/Homo linage approximate to 17 MYBP. The same datings were obtained in an analysis of clocklike evolving genes. The findings show that recalculation is necessary of all molecular datings based directly or indirectly on a Cercopithecoidea/Hominoidea split 30 MYBP."
Analysis of urine from free-ranging mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) for normal physiologic values,"['Sleeman, JM', 'Mudakikwa, AB']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,DEC 1998,6,Voided urine samples were collected from apparently healthy free-living mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) and analyzed for normal physiologic values. Mountain gorillas were found to have a high urinary pH (x = 8.45) and low specific gravity (x = 1.013). Commercial dipsticks appear to be unreliable for the measurement of specific gravity and leukocytes. The establishment of urinary reference intervals should aid in the noninvasive detection of certain diseases in the mountain gorilla and assist with prompt and effective decisions regarding the immobilization and treatment of individual gorillas.

HLA-H: A pseudogene with increased variation due to balancing selection at neighboring loci,"['Grimsley, C', 'Mather, KA', 'Ober, C']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,DEC 1998,32,"The HLA complex includes the most polymorphic genes in the human genome. However, the HLA class Ib loci have little, if any, nucleotide variation, presumably due to their specialized functions or perhaps due to a lack of function. This population genetic study of HLA-H, a class I pseudogene, was initiated to determine the pattern of variation at neutral sites within the HLA complex. We found that the pattern of variation for HLA-H is consistent with the neutral model. However, the amount of variation in HLA-H is significantly greater than estimates for other silent sites within the human genome outside of the MHC (theta = 0.0144, P < 0.000001). Our study further indicates that other possible causes of increased variation such as a high mutation rate for HLA-H, interlocus gene conversion, increased diversity in the sample population in general, and selection acting directly on HLA-H are unlikely. Instead, these data suggest that HLA-H has increased variation as a result of balancing selection acting on nearby loci such as HLA-A."

FMO2, or ""puhnonary"" FMO, one of five forms of the enzyme identified in mammals, is expressed predominantly in lung and differs from other FMOs in that it can catalyze the N-oxidation of certain primary alkylamines. We describe here the isolation and characterization of cDNAs for human FMO2. Analysis of the sequence of the cDNAs and of a section of the corresponding gene revealed that the major FMO2 allele of humans encodes a polypeptide that, compared with the orthologous protein of other mammals, lacks 64 amino acid residues from its C terminus. Heterologous expression of the cDNA revealed that the truncated polypeptide was catalytically inactive. The nonsense mutation that gave rise to the truncated polypeptide, a C -->T transition in codon 472, is not present in the FMO2 gene of closely related primates, including gorilla and chimpanzee, and must therefore have arisen in the human lineage after the divergence of the Homo and Pan clades. Possible mechanisms for the fixation of the mutation in the human population and the potential significance of the loss of functional FMO2 in humans are discussed."

Evolution of RPS4Y,"['Bergen, AW', 'Pratt, M', 'Mehlman, PT', 'Goldman, D', 'PSEUDOAUTOSOMAL BOUNDARY']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,NOV 1998,7,"Sequence variation within RPS4Y, a ribosomal protein gene located in the nonpseudoautosomal region of the Y chromosome, was used to elucidate the origin of this gene in primates. Complete coding and additional flanking sequences (949 bp) of the RPS4Y locus were determined in four nonhuman primate species. Phylogenetic reconstruction of RPS4 sequence evolution supports the monophyly of mammalian RPS4 and RPS4Y. Molecular evolutionary rate estimation reveals significantly elevated rates of DNA and protein evolution in RPS4Y compared with its X-chromosome homologs. These rates enable us to estimate the timing of the transposition of RPS4X to the Y chromosome (95% confidence interval, 32 MYA-74 MYA), and this estimate was verified by Southern hybridization analysis of prosimian and simian genomic DNA. These data support a transposition event of ancestral primate RPS4X to the Y chromosome prior to the divergence of Prosimii."
Preponderance of slightly deleterious polymorphism in mitochondrial DNA: Nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio is much higher within species than between species,"['Hasegawa, M', 'Cao, Y', 'Yang, ZH']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,NOV 1998,99,"We estimated synonymous (d(N)) and nonsynonymous (d(S)) substitution rates for protein-coding genes of the mitochondrial genome from two individuals each of the species human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. The genes were analyzed both separately and in a combined data set. Pairwise sequence comparisons suggest that the d(N)/d(S) rate ratios are about 5-10 times higher in within-species comparisons than in between-species comparisons. This result is confirmed by a more rigorous likelihood ratio test, which rejected the null hypothesis that the d(N)/d(S) rate ratios are identical within and between species. The Likelihood models account for the genetic code structure, transition/transversion rate ratio, and codon usage bias and are expected to produce more reliable results than the commonly used contingency test. Separate analyses of different genes show that the d(N)/d(S) rate ratios are higher within species than between species for all 13 mitochondrial genes, with the difference being statistically significant for all except three small or slowly evolving genes. Furthermore, in conserved genes, nonsynonymous rates within species tend to be higher than the between-species rates by a greater proportion than in fast-changing genes. Our findings confirm and extend earlier results obtained from smaller data sets and suggest the operation of slightly deleterious mutations throughout the mitochondrial genome in the hominoids. Implications of the results for evolutionary studies and, in particular, for studies of the origin of modern humans, are discussed."

A structural difference between the cell surfaces of humans and the great apes,"['Muchmore, EA', 'Diaz, S', 'Varki, A']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199810)107:2<187::AID-AJPA5>3.0.CO;2-S,OCT 1998,97,"The sialic acids are major components of the cell surfaces of animals of the deuterostome lineage. Earlier studies suggested that humans may not express N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a hydroxylated form of the common sialic acid N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). We find that while Neu5Gc is essentially undetectable on human plasma proteins and erythrocytes, it is a major component in all the four extant great apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and orangutan) as well as in many other mammals. This marked difference is also seen amongst cultured lymphoblastoid cells from humans and great apes, as well as in a variety of other tissues compared between humans and chimpanzees, including the cerebral cortex and the cerebrospinal fluid. Biosynthetically, Neu5Gc arises from the action of a hydroxylase that converts the nucleotide donor CMP-Neu5Ac to CMP-Neu5Gc. This enzymatic activity is present in chimpanzee cells, but not in human cells. However, traces of Neu5Gc occur in some human tissues, and others have reported expression of Neu5Gc in human cancers and fetal tissues. Thus, the enzymatic capacity to express Neu5Gc appears to have been suppressed sometime after the great ape-hominid divergence. As terminal structures on cell surfaces, sialic acids are involved in intercellular cross-talk involving specific vertebrate lectins, as well as in microbe-host recognition involving a wide variety of pathogens. The level of sialic acid hydroxylation (level of Neu5Ac versus Neu5Gc) is known to positively or negatively affect several of these endogenous and exogenous interactions. Thus, there are potential functional consequences of this widespread structural change in humans affecting the surfaces of cells throughout the body. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Cryopreservation of non-human primate sperm: priorities for future research,"['Morrell, JM', 'Hodges, JK']",ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE,10.1016/S0378-4320(98)00126-2,OCT 1998,26,"Wild populations of many non-human primate species have declined alarmingly due to habitat destruction, hunting and genetic isolation. Captive breeding programmes to aid species survival could be enhanced by the use of assisted reproductive techniques, such as artificial insemination (AI), if a source of viable sperm was readily accessible. Cryobanks of primate sperm could provide such a supply if techniques for freezing sperm could be developed. Although sporadic attempts to cryopreserve primate sperm have been reported for some of the more frequently encountered zoo-maintained species, there is limited information available on techniques for sperm collection and storage. It is vital that adequate reporting of all cryopreservation attempts be made to avoid repetition of inappropriate methodologies and wastage of valuable genetic material from rare or endangered animals. An integrated approach to the cryobanking of non-human primate sperm is considered to be essential for species conservation. In this review, the factors affecting the success of sperm cryopreservation are outlined, existing information is compiled from previous reported attempts at cryopreservation, and suggestions are made for cryopreserving sperm in further non-human primate species. Moreover, recommendations are given for additional studies to augment existing data. It is intended that this information should serve as a guide for developing cryopreservation protocols in the future, particularly for endangered species. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Learning by imitation: A hierarchical approach,"['Byrne, RW', 'Russon, AE']",BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES,10.1017/S0140525X98001745,OCT 1998,319,"To explain social learning without invoking the cognitively complex concept of imitation, many learning mechanisms have been proposed. Borrowing an idea used routinely in cognitive psychology, we argue that most of these alternatives can be subsumed under a single process, priming, in which input increases the activation of stored internal representations. Imitation itself has generally been seen as a ""speciaI faculty"" This has diverted much research towards the all-or-none question of whether an animal can imitate, with disappointingly inconclusive results. In the great apes, however, voluntary learned behaviour is organized hierarchically. This means that imitation can occur at various levers, of which we single out two clearly distinct ones: the ""action level,"" a rather detailed and linear specification of sequential acts, and the ""program level,"" a broader description of subroutine structure and the hierarchical layout of a behavioural ""program."" Program level imitation is a high-level, constructive mechanism, adapted for the efficient learning of complex skills and thus not evident in the simple manipulations used to test for imitation in the laboratory. As examples, we describe the food preparation techniques of wild mountain gorillas and the imitative behaviour of orangutans undergoing ""rehabilitation"" to the wild. Representing and manipulating relations between objects seems to be one basic building block in their hierarchical programs. There is evidence that great apes suffer from a stricter capacity limit than humans in the hierarchical depth of planning. We re-interpret some chimpanzee behaviour previously described as ""emulation"" and suggest that all great apes may be able to imitate at the program level. Action level imitation is seldom observed in great ape skill learning, and may have a largely social role, even in humans."

In contrast, the lack of data leave the role of imitation in gorillas doubtful."

The two empirical examples recounted - gorilla plant processing and orangutan manipulation of human artifacts - are hierarchically organized behaviors, but there is very little evidence that they involve imitative learning, program-level or otherwise."
Differences between vervets (Cercopithecus aethiops) and patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas) in agonistic interactions between adult females,"['Isbell, LA', 'Pruetz, JD']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1020393329574,OCT 1998,45,"We examined agonistic interactions between adult females in wild, unprovisioned patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas) and vervets (Cercopithecus aethiops). The dominance hierarchy of patas is far less clear than that of vervets. Patas had fewer interactions per dyad, fewer dyads with interactions, and a high percentage (18%) of reversals in which lower-ranking females won in agonistic interactions with higher-ranking females. Although the rank ordering of the kinds of interactions patas and vervets displayed is similar, with avoidance being the most frequently observed agonistic response to approaches by other females, patas were chased and supplanted more often than vervets were. The resources over which females were supplanted also differ between species. Supplants over food comprise smaller proportion of total supplants patas than for vervets. Patas appear to feed on less usurpable foods than vervets. We conclude that (I) Erythrocebus and Cercopithecus spp., except C. aethiops, should not be categorized with other Cercopithecinae, and C. aethiops should not be categorized with other Cercopithecus spp. and Erythrocebus, in discussions and analyses of relationships between females within groups and (2) ecological conditions, i.e., usurpability of foods, can override phylogenetic history as the selective pressure determining the nature of female competitive relationships within groups."

Enamel thickness has also been discussed extensively in relation to the phylogenetic relationships among the hominoids. The aims of this study were: (1) to analyse enamel thickness/tooth size relationships among primates as a whole, and (2) to evaluate variations in enamel thickness among hominoids against the background of the other primates. We employed measures of tooth size, and of enamel thickness and quantity based on measurements of areas in longitudinal sections of 125 molars of 39 species. Among primates, there were two grades of enamel thickness, prosimians having thinner enamel for a given tooth size or body weight than anthropoids. The scaling of enamel thickness with tooth size and body weight tended to show positive allometry among anthropoids. Comparison of hominoid enamel thicknesses with that in anthropoids led to the conclusion that Hylobates has enamel of average thickness, Homo has thick enamel and Gorilla has thin enamel, while Pan and Pongo had average or thin enamel, depending on tooth type. These results may be relevant to considerations of hominoid evolution. (C) 1998 Academic Press."
Exchange of objects between humans and captive western lowland gorillas,"['Chalmeau, R', 'Peignot, P']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557563,OCT 1998,8,"An experiment was carried out to assess the ability of captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla) to exchange objects with a human partner. Before the exchange itself, individuals had to learn to give an item to the experimenter. Four individuals out of nine performed active giving. After that familiarization with giving behaviour, two kinds of exchanges, of increasing complexity, were tested with gorillas. Simple exchange (give C to obtain D) was the first procedure and six gorillas out of nine succeeded. Double exchange (give B to receive C, then give back C to obtain D) was performed only by three individuals and triple exchange (give A to receive B, give back B to receive C, then give back C to obtain D) was performed only by two individuals. Different types of errors were scored, as well as social constraints on learning. Results showed that (1) naive gorillas are able to geta reward (D) in an experimental exchange situation; and (2) the complex rules of multiple successive exchanges were not easily understood by gorillas."
The nature and evolution of intelligence in orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus),"['Russon, AE']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557571,OCT 1998,24,"Orangutans share many intellectual qualities with African great apes and humans, likely because of their recent common ancestry. They may also show unique intellectual adaptations because of their long evolutionary divergence from the African lineage. This paper assesses orangutan intelligence in light of this evolutionary history. Evidence derives from observations of juvenile ex-captive orangutans reintroduced to free forest life by the Wanariset Orangutan Reintroduction Project, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The intellectual qualities shared by great apes and humans point to a distinct ""great ape"" intelligence with hierarchization as a pivotal cognitive mechanism. Evolutionary reconstructions jibe with this view and suggest that technically difficult foods may have been key selection pressures. Orangutans should then show hierarchical intelligence when obtaining difficult foods. Evidence on ex-captive orangutans' techniques for processing difficult foods concurs. intellectual qualities distinct to orangutans may owe to arboreal travel pressures; in particular, arboreality may aggravate foraging problems. Evidence confirms that ex-captive orangutans' techniques for accessing difficult foods located arboreally are intellectually complex-i.e. they show hierarchization. These findings suggest other factors probably important to understanding great ape and orangutan forms of intelligence and their evolutionary origins."
Qa-1(b) binds conserved class I leader peptides derived from several mammalian species,"['Kurepa, Z', 'Hasemann, CA', 'Forman, J']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE,10.1084/jem.188.5.973,SEP 7 1998,62,"Qa-1(b) binds a peptide (AMAPRTLLL), referred to as Qdm (for Qa-1 determinant modifier), derived from the signal sequence of murine class Ia molecules. This peptide binds with high affinity and accounts for almost all of the peptides associated with this molecule. Human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-E, a homologue of Qa-1(b), binds similar peptides derived from human class Ia molecules and interacts with CD94/NKG2 receptors on natural killer cells. We used surface plasmon resonance to determine the ability of Qa-1(b) to bind related ligands representing peptides derived from the leaders of class I molecules from several mammalian species. All of the peptides reported to bind HLA-E bound readily to Qa-1(b). In addition, peptides derived from leader segments of different mammals also bound to Qa-1(b), indicating a conservation of this ""Qdm-like"" epitope throughout mammalian evolution. We have attempted to define a minimal peptide on a polyglycine backbone that binds Qa-1(b). Our previous findings showed that P2 and P9 are important but not sufficient for binding to Qa-1(b). Although a minimum peptide (GMGGGGLLL) bound Qa-1(b), its interaction was relatively weak, as were peptides sharing five or six residues with Qdm, indicating that multiple native residues are required for a strong interaction. This finding is consistent with the observation that this molecule preferentially binds this single ligand."

Such studies have offered but a limited glimpse at differences in occlusal relief among taxa. Such differences in dental topography may relate to tooth function and, so, have considerable implications for the inference of diet from fossil teeth. In this article, we describe a technique to model and compare primate molars in three dimensions using Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) software. We examine unworn lower second molars of three extant hominoids with known differences in diet (Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Pongo pygmaeus), and two fossil forms, (Afropithecus turkanesis and Dryopithecus laietanus). First, we obtained approximately 400 landmarks on the occlusal surfaces of each tooth using an electromagnetic digitizer. Raster ""terrain models"" of occlusal surfaces were then created by interpolation of the coordinate data. We used GRASS terrain analysis automated techniques to quantify the volumes and slopes of individual cusps. We also used the GRASS watershed technique to identify the volume of liquid that would accumulate in each tooth's basin (a measure of basin area), and the directions and intensity of drainage over the occlusal surface.

The results showed that this peculiar chromosome has undergone rapid and unconstrained evolution both in sequence content and organization."
Interspecies comparative genome hybridization and interspecies representational difference analysis reveal gross DNA differences between humans and great apes,"['Toder, R', 'Xia, Y', 'Bausch, E']",CHROMOSOME RESEARCH,10.1023/A:1009208730186,SEP 1998,13,"Comparative chromosome G-/R-banding, comparative gene mapping and chromosome painting techniques have demonstrated that only few chromosomal rearrangements occurred during great ape and human evolution. Interspecies comparative genome hybridization (CGH), used here in this study, between human, gorilla and pygmy chimpanzee revealed species-specific regions in all three species. In contrast to the human, a far more complex distribution of species-specific blocks was detected with CGH in gorilla and pygmy chimpanzee. Most of these blocks coincide with already described heterochromatic regions on gorilla and chimpanzee chromosomes. Representational difference analysis (RDA) was used to subtract the complex genome of gorilla against human in order to enrich gorilla-specific DNA sequences. Gorilla-specific clones isolated with this technique revealed a 32-bp repeat unit. These clones were mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to the telomeric regions of gorilla chromosomes that had been shown by interspecies CGH to contain species-specific sequences."
Inhibition of condensation in human chromosomes induced by the thymidine analogue 5-iododeoxyuridine,"['Ott, G', 'Haaf, T', 'Schmid, M']",CHROMOSOME RESEARCH,10.1023/A:1009260714256,SEP 1998,8,"Human lymphocyte cultures were treated with iododeoxyuridine. This 5-halogenated thymidine analogue induces distinct undercondensations of the heterochromatin of human chromosome 9. The condensation of the other heterochromatic regions on chromosomes 1, 15, 16 and Y is also inhibited, but to a lesser extent. Optimum cell culture conditions required for the induction of undercondensations were determined. Up to 90% of mitotic cells reveal chromosome 9 heterochromatin decondensations when the substance is present in quantities of 1 x 10(-4) M during the last 7 h before cell fixation. In addition, examples of the usefulness of 5-IUDR in the analysis of chromosome aberrations involving chromosome 9 are presented. The interaction between 5-IUDR and chromosomal DNA, the modification of chromosomal proteins and factors inducing chromosomal decondensations are discussed."
Spontaneous cleft palate in a newborn gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Siebert, JR', 'Williams, B', 'Collins, D', 'Winkler, LA', 'Swindler, DR']",CLEFT PALATE-CRANIOFACIAL JOURNAL,10.1597/1545-1569(1998)035<0436:SCPIAN>2.3.CO;2,SEP 1998,5,"Objective: We report the first case of cleft palate in a newborn male gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla).

Case History and Results: The full-term infant was born to clinically healthy, wild-caught parents and survived 5 days. Autopsy disclosed a unilateral cleft palate, moderate scalp hemorrhage (birth versus postnatal trauma), cerebral edema, and a sterile fibrin vegetation in the heart. The palate was also shorter and narrower than expected, and the biorbital breadth was reduced; otherwise, growth and development appeared normal, Standard cranial and intraoral radiographs and three-dimensional reconstructions of computerized tomographic (CT) scans provided thorough and noninvasive methods of studying the craniofacial complex and extracranial skeleton. By this technique, major findings were: intact premaxilla, interpremaxillary, and premaxillary/maxillary sutures; intramaxillary cleft with ipsilateral choanal atresia; mildly asymmetric inferior turbinates; and normal nasal septum and vomer.

Conclusions: Except for choanal atresia, cleft palate was not associated with other major craniofacial or extracranial anomalies in this case. Choanal atresia has been observed at times with cleft palate, but to our knowledge, the association has not been reported in nonhuman primates. Cleft palate, with or without cleft lip, has been recognized in a variety of nonhuman primates, including the lemur, marmoset, tamarin, squirrel monkey, and macaque. Some occurrences are spontaneous, while others are syndromic and/or arise from genetic or teratogenic influences. Each mode of presentation is poorly understood in nonhuman primates, but in this case, the absence of relevant environmental or parental history suggests that the occurrence was spontaneous. Anatomic studies of nonhuman primates are particularly valuable when they involve endangered species and will hopefully increase our understanding of the pathogenesis and etiology of congenital disorders, as well as other relationships between nonhuman primates and humans."

In this study, we have characterized a new OR gene, 912-93, in primates, This gene is unique and it defines a new OR family, It localizes to human chromosome 11q11-12 and at syntenical sites in other hominoids, The sequence marks a previously unrecognized rearrangement of pericentromeric material from chromosome 11 to the centromeric region of gibbon chromosome 5. The human gene contains a nonsense point mutation in the region corresponding to the extracellular N-terminus of the receptor. This mutation is present in humans of various ethnic groups, but is absent in apes, suggesting that it probably appeared during the divergence of humans from other apes, <4 000 000-5 000 000 years ago. A second mutation, a frameshift at a different location, has occurred in the gorilla copy of this gene. These observations suggest that OR 912-93 has been recently silenced in human and gorilla, adding to a pool of OR pseudogenes whose growth may parallel a reduction in the sense of smell in primates."
Effects of beta(2)-microglobulin mutations on the alpha-1 helical region of H2-L-d,"['Schultz, CS', 'Rodriguez, RA', 'Chew, EA', 'Dimaano, C', 'Li, FM', 'Santos, MD', 'Nieto, MC']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s002510050432,SEP 1998,5,"Beta-2 microglobulin (beta(2)m)has been shown to have an effect on the structural and functional constraints that facilitate proper class I antigen presentation. To date, no evidence has pinpointed the beta(2)m-specific amino acids that play an integral role in affecting structure in and around the peptide binding region of class I. To delineate beta(2)m amino acid positions that affect the alpha-1 helical region, we generated a series of mutant beta(2)m proteins bearing precise amino acid substitutions. The amino acid positions chosen were based upon previous results which demonstrated that human beta(2)m association with H2-L-d altered the structure of the alpha-1/alpha-2 super-domain. beta(2)m mutant proteins were used in beta(2)m exchange assays with cells expressing H2-Ld. Following exchange, cells were assayed to determine whether mutant beta(2)m association resulted in structural alteration of class I extracellular domains. The alteration in H2-L-d structure was evidenced by an increase in the binding of an antibody (34-1-2), specific for the alpha-1 helical region of H2-L-d. Results demonstrated that amino acid substitutions in beta(2)m positions 33 and 53 led to a dramatic increase in the reactivity of the alpha-1 domain-specific antibody 34-1-2. Identifying beta(2)m amino acid positions that influence the structure of the peptide binding region may allow for a better understanding of cellular immune responses that center upon class I/beta(2)m expression."

Here we analyzed the region surrounding the LRE1 locus in humans and gorillas to determine the evolutionary history of the region and to estimate the age of L1.2. We found that the region was composed of an ancient L1, L1Hs-Lrg, which was significantly divergent from all other L1 sequences available in the databases. We also determined that L1.2 was absent from the gorilla genome and arose in humans after the divergence of gorilla and human Lineages. Ln the gorilla LRE1 region, we discovered a different full-length L1 element, L1Gg-1, which was allelic and present at a high gene frequency in gorillas but absent from other primates. We determined the nucleotide sequence of L1Gg-1 and found that it was 98% identical to L1.2, suggesting a close relationship between active L1s in gorillas and humans."
Protein deficiency in a colony of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla),"['Mundy, NI', 'Ancrenaz, M', 'Wickings, EJ', 'Lunn, PG']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,SEP 1998,11,"A syndrome of alopecia and weight loss in a colony of 10 western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Gabon during a 3-yr period was apparently due to a dietary protein deficiency, with nine individuals affected to some extent. The most severely afflicted was a 4-yr-old female who eventually died as a result of acute gastroenteritis caused by Shigella flexneri. Clinical signs included chronic alopecia, hair discoloration, failure to thrive, and weight loss, and their severity was directly correlated with the degree of hypoalbuminemia (12 g/L in the most extreme case) and normocytic normochromic anemia. Preliminary clinical tests and autopsy results suggested a dietary protein or amino acid deficiency as the cause of the hypoalbuminemia, and further analyses of serum amino acid and protein levels were consistent with a diagnosis of dietary protein deficiency. Supplementation of the colony diet with a protein preparation for humans produced a rapid amelioration of signs and improvement in body and coat condition, a normalization of serum albumin and total protein levels, and disappearance of the anemia in all affected animals except a 12-yr-old male, who responded well to treatment with anabolic steroids. The natural diet of western lowland gorillas is surprisingly high in protein, and the dietary protein requirement bf captive gorillas may be increased as a result of the absence of commensal gastrointestinal ciliates."

Whilst the beta subunit is apparently testis-specific, the finding of low levels of fertilin alpha in nonreproductive tissues has cast some doubt on a unique role in fertilisation. Moreover, the absence of a functional fertilin alpha gene in the human would imply that this gene product is not absolutely essential for fertilisation, although it could play a facilitatory role. We now describe the organisation and sequence of the fertilin alpha genes in a range of primates, including the great apes, and find that the gorilla gene, like that of the human, is non-functional.

The PT was measured in both the sagittal and coronal planes by use of multiplanar reformatting software. The PT could only be identified in the sample of great apes and not in the remaining non-human primate species. Within the great ape sample, the PT was larger in the left hemisphere than in the right in a statistical majority of the subjects. These results are consistent with the notion that the PT evolved as a definable structure about 15 million years ago and may have arisen as a result for selection for greater cortical folding which in turn led to greater gyrification in larger brains.

"Long-term habitat use by mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei). I. Consistency, variation, and home range size and stability","['Watts, DP']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1020324909101,AUG 1998,48,"Mountain gorillas are highly folivorous. Food is abundant and perennially available in much of their habitat. Still, limited reseal ch has shown that single gorilla groups heavily used areas where food biomass and quality were relatively high and where they met daily nutritional needs with relatively low foraging effort. Also, ecological factors influenced solitary males less than groups with females. Long-term data on habitat use by multiple mountain gorilla social units and more extensive data on variation in food distribution presented here, confirm that food distribution influences areal occupation densities across groups and over time. These data also confirm the group/solitary male distinction and show that food distribution became more important for one male once he acquired females. Groups used less than or equal to 25 km(2), and inter-annual home range and core area overlap was often low. Annual home range and core area size varied considerably within groups and across years. It bore no simple relationship to group size and estimated group biomass. Core areas were biased samples of total home ranges and were relatively good foraging areas. One group abruptly shifted its home range in response to male mating competition. Home ranges of two others expanded from 1981 to 1987, though at a decreasing rate. Data on one such group, which varied considerably in size, are consistent with arguments that costs of scramble competition are low except in unusually large groups. Low site fidelity low scramble costs, and high home range overlap should decrease the ecological costs of female transfer."
"Long-term habitat use by mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei). 2. Reuse of foraging areas in relation to resource abundance, quality, and depletion","['Watts, DP']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1020376925939,AUG 1998,28,"Resource depression caused by current feeding and the rate of resource renewal should influence foragers' decisions about when to revisit foraging areas. Adjustment of foraging paths and revisit rates should be particularly important when resources renew slowly. Foragers can also benefit by returning more often to highly profitable than to less profitable foraging areas. Many highly frugivorous primates seem to time revisits to fruit sources so as to harvest fruit efficiently and, also, use efficient search paths. Fewer data on non-frugivores exist. Mountain gorillas are folivores that eat mostly perennially available, continuously growing herbs and vines. Vegetation regenerates slowly from the effects of gorilla trampling, though trampling can also facilitate food species productivity, at least in the short term. Adjustment of intervals between visits to foraging areas to the extent of previous use and to resource renewal rates should increase gorilla foraging efficiency. Long-term data on habitat use by 6 mountain gorilla social units show that revisit intervals vary in association with variation in the extent of previous use and in plant productivity. However they also revisit areas more often, the higher the biomass and nutritional quality of food there. These data are generally consistent with the hypothesis that the gorillas crop resources on a sustained-yield basis, though more precise data on areal revisits and complementary long-term data on vegetation composition would be needed to test the hypothesis."
Social behavior of black-handed spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) reared as home pets,"['Anaya-Huertas, C', 'Mondragon-Ceballos, R']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1020385127756,AUG 1998,5,"We studied the interactions between and within sexes of 7 molar categories of behavior-aggression, submission, avoid-retreat, social grooming, together, social play, and sexual interest-in a newly formed captive group of spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) reared as pets and unacquainted with each other. Free-ranging Ateles geoffroyi show a characteristic sex-determined patterning of intragroup social interactions and relationships: males are more affiliative with males, and females are more solitary and more prone to be attacked by males. Our rationale, using socially handicapped subjects, was to test whether the monkeys were able to develop species-typical social relationships and constitute a cohesive group. We studied the group of 8 males and 6 females in an outdoor cage throughout 31 weeks, starting I week after the formation of the group. Their rate of interactions is not much different from those reported for natural groups. The patterning of interactions for almost all behaviors is similar to that which has been observed in wild groups. Our findings suggest that spider monkeys, despite unnatural nurturing, follow an innate species specific motivational script in the patterning of their interactions."

The determination of the piriform aperture index (breadth/height) allowed the authors to demonstrate a marked elongation of the aperture in Home compared with Gorilla and Pan. Individual characterization of the shape was possible with great precision and without ambiguity by using Fourier analysis. An absolute, interspecific partition between Gorilla, Pan, and Home resulted from the canonical discriminant analysis of the Fourier descriptors. However, a closeness of shape between some individuals in Pan and some in Gorilla and Home was observed, demonstrating a morphological continuum of the shape of the piriform aperture in hominoids: Pan was in intermediate position between Gorilla and Home. Interspecific differences between Home and the group Pan-Gorilla were explained principally by the differences in elongation (amplitude of the second harmonic) and pentagonality (amplitude of the fifth harmonic) and by differences in orientation of quadrangularity (phase of the fourth harmonic). Differences in the shape of the piriform aperture between Pan and Gorilla were explained by differences in orientation of elongation (phase of the second harmonic) and by differences in the component of triangularity (amplitude of the third harmonic). In Gorilla and Pan, the little, elongated, and relatively trapezoidal piriform aperture seems to be a shared primitive feature (plesiomorphic), whereas an elongated piriform aperture seems to be a characteristic and derived feature (apomorphic) of modern Home sapiens.

"Evolutionary divergence of the oncogenes GLI, HST and INT2","['Conte, RA', 'Samonte, RV', 'Verma, RS']",HEREDITY,NA,JUL 1998,1,"Almost a quarter of a century ago, the banding patterns of human and other higher primate chromosomes were compared, creating a barrage of speculation. Consequently, a number of approaches have been used to understand human descent. Chromosome modifications are believed to be important in the origin of species, and pericentric inversions account for the majority of evolutionary chromosomal alterations seen in Hominoidea. A comparative mapping fluorescence in situ hybridization technique, using locus-specific DNA probes as phylogenetic markers, was used to decipher the pericentric inversions of human chromosomes 11 and 12. Human-derived (Homo sapiens, HSA) DNA probes for GLI, HST and INT2 protooncogenes were used to identify their homologous locations in the chromosomes of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, PTR), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla, GGO) and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus, PPY). The INT2 and HST loci mapping results confirm the earlier putative claim that a pericentric inversion took place in HSA chromosome 11 and its equivalent PTR and GGO chromosomes. In addition, these data provide additional information regarding the orangutan's position on the evolutionary tree of Pongidae and Hominidae. GLI mapping reveals that a pericentric inversion occurred in the HSA chromosome 12 equivalent in PTR and GGO, but was not seen in HSA or PPY. These pericentric inversions in PTR and GGO may have occurred at a period when both PTR and GGO had branched off from the Hominoidae trunk. The use of loci-specific probes to decipher pericentric inversions has proved to be a formidable approach in characterizing chromosome rearrangements and providing further evidence on human descent."

This study concentrates on the subset of associated skeletons which preserve the reciprocal surfaces of a joint. It uses laser scanning to explore whether the shapes of the reciprocal surfaces of a joint of an individual are significantly more congruent than the surfaces of randomly-matched pairings taken from the same species. Laser scanning was used to capture the distal articular surface of the left tibia of OH35 and the trochlear articular surface of the talus of OH8, both from Bed I, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. The degree of congruency between those articular surfaces was tested against the congruency of the talocrural joint of AL 288-1 (Australopithecus afarensis), and the congruency of both associated and randomly-matched talocrural joints of modern humans, chimpanzees and gorillas. The results suggest that OH35 and OH8 do not come from the same individual and may not come from the same species. Although this analysis leaves open the taxonomic affinity of OH35, it demonstrates the potential of laser scanning for capturing 3D data in palaeoanthropology. It also demonstrates the potential for using the relative congruency of reciprocal joint surfaces as a test of the likelihood that isolated limb bones are components of a single individual."

Based on its Glu-tRNA primer binding site specificity and the location within the PTN gene, we named this element HERV-E.PTN. HERV-E.PTN appears to be a recombined viral element based on its high homology (70 to 86%) in distinct areas to members of two distantly related HERV type C families, HERV-E and retrovirus-like element I (RTVL-I). Furthermore, its pseudogene region is organized from 5' to 3' into gag-, pol-, env-, pol-, env-similar sequences, Interestingly, full-length and partial HERV-E.PTN-homologous sequences were found in the human X chromosome, the human hereditary haemochromatosis region, and the BRCA1 pseudogene. Finally, Southern analyses indicate that the HERV-E.PTN element is present in the PTN gene of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas but not of rhesus monkeys, suggesting that genomic insertion occurred after the separation of monkeys and apes about 25 million years ago."

Evidence from urinary cortisol that maternal behavior is related to stress in gorillas,"['Bahr, NI', 'Pryce, CR', 'Dobeli, M', 'Martin, RD']",PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR,10.1016/S0031-9384(98)00057-2,JUN 15 1998,54,"By studying western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla, n = 8) in zoological gardens via ethological and non-invasive physiological techniques, we have demonstrated that their postpartum maternal behavior is related negatively to their postpartum urinary titers of cortisol. On the basis of this finding, it is proposed that postpartum stress contributes to disrupted maternal behavior in the gorilla in captivity. Morning urine samples were collected with a mean sampling interval of 1.6 days from Day 14 prepartum to Day 14 postpartum (n = 11 pregnancies). Creatinine-indexed (Cr) urinary cortisol titers declined significantly between Day 9 to 1 prepartum (0.634 +/- 0.014 mu g/mg of Cr, mean +/- SEM) and Day 1 to 6 postpartum (0.396 +/- 0.030 mu g/mg of Cr, mean +/- SEM; p < 0.01-0.001). For each pregnancy, the relative postpartum decline in urinary cortisol was calculated as (mu g of cortisol/mg of Cr Day 1 to 4)/(mu g of cortisol/mg of Cr Day -4 to -1). Values ranged from 0.35 to 1.12, were independent of absolute prepartum cortisol titers, and were interpreted as evidence of inter-female differences in postpartum hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and, therefore, postpartum stress. This postpartum stress index was negatively correlated with the amount of time (0-100%) that females carried and supported their 0-14 day-old infants in a ventral position during locomotion (r(s) = -0.68, p < 0.05) and tended to be negatively correlated with the total amount of time (0-100%) they spent in ventro-ventral contact with their infants (r(s) = -0.58; p < 0.10).

Mitochondrial complexes TC, III, IV, and V had activities indistinguishable from parental human or non-human primate cells. In contrast, a complex I deficiency was observed in all HXC. Kinetic studies of complex I using decylubiquinone or NADH as Limiting substrates showed that the V-max was decreased in HXC by approximately 40%, and the K-m for the NADH was significantly increased (3-fold, p < 0.001), Rotenone inhibition studies of intact cell respiration and pyruvate-malate oxidation in permeabilized cells showed that 3 nM rotenone produced a mild effect in control cells (0-10% inhibition) but produced a marked inhibition of HXC respiration (50-75%). Immunoblotting analyses of three subunits of complex I (ND1, 75 and 49 kDa) showed that their relative amounts were not significantly altered in HXC cells, These results establish EMC as cellular models of complex I deficiency in humans and underscore the importance of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes co-evolution in optimizing oxidative phosphorylation function."

In a large marshy opening, five species of birds exploited the actions of large terrestrial mammals to flush prey, two species of birds used two species of aquatic mammals to expose prey, and another bird species fed directly on mammalian ectoparasites, African jacanas had a higher foraging rate when associated with gorillas and elephants than when alone, and great egrets had a higher capture efficiency when elephants were present. In a second opening, covered by a shallow, algae-laden pond, African jacanas, finfeet, and Hartlaub's ducks competed to remove arthropod ectoparasites from forest buffalo and bongo antelope, both of which consistently reacted to the alarm calls of jacanas and Hartlaub's ducks. At least ten species of birds directly benefit from associations with mammals. Indirect benefits were also noted as African jacanas, black crakes, and palm-nut vultures selected food items from elephant and buffalo dung."
Limbic frontal cortex in hominoids: A comparative study of area 13,"['Semendeferi, K', 'Armstrong, E', 'Schleicher, A', 'Zilles, K', 'Van Hoesen, GW']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199806)106:2<129::AID-AJPA3>3.3.CO;2-5,JUN 1998,73,"The limbic frontal cortex forms part of the neural substrate responsible for emotional reactions to social stimuli. Area 13 is one of the cortical areas long known to be part of the posterior orbitofrontal cortex in several monkey species, such as the macaque. Its presence nevertheless in the human brain has been unclear, and the cortex of the frontal lobe of the great and lesser apes remains largely unknown.

In this study area 13 was identified in human, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon brains, and cortical maps were generated on the basis of its cytoarchitecture. Imaging techniques were used to characterize and quantify the microstructural organization of the area, and stereological tools were applied for estimates of the volume of area 13 in all species.

Area 13 is conservative in its structure, and features such as size of cortical layers, density of neurons, and space available for connections are similar across hominoids with only subtle differences present. In contrast to the homogeneity found in its organization, variation is present in the relative size of this cortical area (as a percentage of total brain volume). The human and the bonobo include a complex orbitofrontal cortex and a relatively smaller area 13. On the contrary the orangutan stands out by having a shorter orbitofrontal region and a more expanded area 13.

Differences in the organization and size of individual cortical areas involved in emotional reactions and social behavior can be related to behavioral specializations of each hominoid and to the evolution of emotions in hominids. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

"Characterization of a novel class of interspersed LTR elements in primate genomes: Structure, genomic distribution, and evolution","['Liao, DQ', 'Pavelitz, T', 'Weiner, AM']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/PL00006345,JUN 1998,24,"Retrovirus-like sequences and their solitary (solo) long terminal repeats (LTRs) are common repetitive elements in eukaryotic genomes. We reported previously that the tandemly arrayed genes encoding U2 snRNA (the RNU2 locus) in humans and apes contain a solo LTR (U2-LTR) which was presumably generated by homologous recombination between the two LTRs of an ancestral provirus that is retained in the orthologous baboon RNU2 locus. We have now sequenced the orthologous U2-LTRs in human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and baboon and examined numerous homologs of the U2-LTR that are dispersed throughout the human genome. Although these U2-LTR homologs have been collectively referred to as LTR13 in the literature, they do not display sequence similarity to any known retroviral LTRs; however, the structure of LTR13 closely resembles that of other retroviral LTRs with a putative promoter, polyadenylation signal, and a tandemly repeated 53-bp enhancer-like element. Genomic blotting indicates that LTR13 is primate-specific; based on sequence analysis, we estimate there are about 2,500 LTR13 elements in the human genome. Comparison of the primate U2-LTR sequences suggests that the homologous recombination event that gave rise to the solo U2-LTR occurred soon after insertion of the ancestral provirus into the ancestral U2 tandem array. Phylogenetic analysis of the LTR13 family confirms that it is diverse, but the orthologous U2-LTRs form a coherent group in which chimpanzee is closest to the humans; orangutan is a clear outgroup of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla; and baboon is a distant relative of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. We compare the LTR13 family with other known LTRs and consider whether these LTRs might play a role in concerted evolution of the primate RNU2 locus."
Comparative study of the genomic organization of DNA repeats within the 5 '-flanking region of the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein gene (NRAMP1) between humans and great apes,"['Roger, M', 'Sanchez, FO', 'Schurr, E']",MAMMALIAN GENOME,10.1007/s003359900792,JUN 1998,3,"The human NRAMP1 gene located on Chromosome (Chr) region 2q35 is a candidate gene for increased risk of infection by several intracellular macrophage parasites, including M. tuberculosis and M, leprae. In search for a possible mutational hot spot, we have analyzed a 3.5-kb region 5' to NRAMP1 that is highly enriched for DNA repeat sequences. The repeat sequences could be grouped into one Mer element and six Alu elements, representing five Alu subfamilies, that had integrated in the same DNA region during successive rounds of Alu retropositional activity. Comparative sequence analysis of the Alu cluster region in humans, chimpanzee (Pan paniscus), and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) revealed only modest sequence variability and failed to detect any evidence for genomic instability of the highly repetitive DNA region. These results show that sequence length variants in the Alu-flanking regions as well as nucleotide substitutions are the most common genomic variations even in a region of extreme Alu-clustering. Moreover, the high degree of sequence conservation among three primate species argues against the Alu cluster being the site of frequent genomic rearrangements or other frequent genetic events that might influence NRAMP1 expression."
Orangutan alpha-satellite monomers are closely related to the human consensus sequence,"['Haaf, T', 'Willard, HF']",MAMMALIAN GENOME,10.1007/s003359900793,JUN 1998,21,"Alpha-satellite is a family of tandemly repeated DNA found at the centromeric regions of all human and primate chromosomes. Human alpha-satellite subsets are largely chromosome-specific and have been further grouped into four suprachromosomal families (SFs), each characterized by a unique set of monomeric types. Although chimpanzee and gorilla alpha-satellites share sufficient sequence similarity to fit the established SFs, the assumption that the derived human alpha-satellite consensus and monomeric types represent the sequence of ancestral repeats remains unestablished. By using oligonucleotide primers specific for a conserved region of human alpha-satellite DNA, we have PCR amplified, cloned, and characterized alpha-satellite sequences from the orangutan genome. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated that orangutan alpha-satellite is formed by a single monomeric type that is sig nificantly closer in percentage of sequence identity (mean = 92%, range = 89-96%) to the overall consensus of human alpha-satellite than to the monomeric types corresponding to the four SFs. Use of cloned sequences as hybridization probes to orangutan genomic DNA digested with a panel of restriction enzymes showed that most orangutan alpha-satellite subsets are characterized by a monomeric construction. The subset homologous to clone PPY2-5 is organized in distinct higher-order repeat structures consisting of 18 adjacent monomers. By FISH two clones, PPY3-4 and PPY3-5, proved to be specific for the alpha-satellite on the orangutan homologs of human Chromosomes (Chrs) 10 and 8, respectively. Our data indicate that there was an ancestral monomeric type displaying high sequence similarity to the overall human consensus from which the different great ape and human subsets and SFs may have originated."

Goodman et al.'s latest proposal gives to the human clade the rank of just a subgenus of the genus Homo. The designation of rank is arrived at (i) as a result of an arbitrary choice; (ii) as an ontological condition. In the second case, adaptive ability may be a criterion to identify real higher taxa and give us a tool to keep the rank of family to classify the human clade (as well as the orang-utan, gorilla and chimpanzee clades)."
The hypoglossal canal and the origin of human vocal behavior,"['Kay, RF', 'Cartmill, M', 'Balow, M']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.95.9.5417,APR 28 1998,66,"The mammalian hypoglossal canal transmits the nerve that supplies the muscles of the tongue, This canal is absolutely and relatively larger in modern humans than it is in the African apes (Pan and Gorilla). We hypothesize that the human tongue is supplied more richly with motor nerves than are those of living apes and propose that canal size in fossil hominids may provide an indication about the motor coordination of the tongue and reflect the evolution of speech and language. Canals of gracile Australopithecus, and possibly Homo habilis, fall within the range of extant Pan and are significantly smaller than those of modern Homo, The canals of Neanderthals and an early ""modern"" Homo sapiens (Skhul 5), as well as of African and European middle Pleistocene Home (Kabwe and Swanscombe), fall within the range of extant Home and are significantly larger than those of Pan troglodytes, These anatomical findings suggest that the vocal capabilities of Neanderthals were the same as those of humans today. Furthermore, the vocal abilities of Australopithecus were not advanced significantly over those of chimpanzees whereas those of Home may have been essentially modern by at least 400,000 years ago. Thus, human vocal abilities may have appeared much earlier in time than the first archaeological evidence for symbolic behavior."
Coamplification and dispersion of adjacent human endogenous retroviral HERV-H and HERV-E elements; Presence of spliced hybrid transcripts in normal leukocytes,"['Lindeskog, M', 'Medstrand, P', 'Cunningham, AA', 'Blomberg, J']",VIROLOGY,10.1006/viro.1998.9106,APR 25 1998,19,"In an RT-PCR study of HERV-H spliced subgenomic transcripts, we found transcripts with HERV-H leader and protease-encoding sequences spliced to HERV-E integrase-encoding sequences in lymphocytes from healthy blood donors. In other cell types, including two T-cell leukemia cell lines, these transcripts were absent. The PCR fragments of the hybrid transcripts contained two open reading frames (ORFs). One was a hybrid HERV-H protease/HERV-E integrase ORF and the other was the HERV-E envelope surface glycoprotein ORF. Alternative splice products were also identified. The genomic DNA origin of the hybrid transcripts was shown to be a HERV-H element with a large 3'-end deletion, adjacent to a HERV-E element lacking the 5'-LTR. This hybrid structure was shown to be amplified and dispersed to six different human chromosomes. Thus, a relatively large part of full-length HERV-E elements(15-20%) is potentially under the transcriptional control of HERV-H LTRs. The HERV-H/HERV-E junction was present in multiple copies also in the chimpanzee and gorilla, but not in the orangutan or old world monkeys. (C) 1998 Academic Press."
Identification of conserved potentially regulatory sequences of the SRY gene from 10 different species of mammals,"['Margarit, E', 'Guillen, A', 'Rebordosa, C', 'Vidal-Taboada, J', 'Sanchez, M', 'Ballesta, F', 'Oliva, R']",BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS,10.1006/bbrc.1998.8441,APR 17 1998,36,"We have sequenced the 5' region of the SRY gene from human, chimpanzee, sheep, and mouse and from four additional mammalian species, not previously characterized (gorilla, gazelle, rat, and guinea pig). In order to identify consented DNA elements potentially involved in the regulation of the SRY gene, the newly determined sequences were analyzed and compared to all mammalian SRY promoter sequences available at present. Ten highly conserved potential regulatory elements have been identified in all 10 species (AP1, Barbie, GATA, Gfi1, cMyb, vMyb, NF1, Oct1, Sp1, and SRY). The known function of several of these regulatory elements fits well with the known expression of the SRY gene. However, except for the highly conserved coding HMG motif, only a short region close to the initiation of transcription in the human SRY is consented in the exact position along the gene in all the species analyzed. This lack of sequence identity at the orthologous positions is consistent with the suggested rapid evolution of the SRY gene. This relative lack of homology contrasts with a high sequence identity of the putative regulatory sequences found within each taxonomic group of species (primates, bovids, and rodents), which supports a common mechanism of SRY expression and possibly also a similar function.

Statistical analysis of shape through triangulation of landmarks: A study of sexual dimorphism in hominids,"['Rao, CR', 'Suryawanshi, S']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.95.8.4121,APR 14 1998,22,"Two objects with homologous landmarks are said to be of the same shape if the configuration of landmarks of one object can be exactly matched with that of the other by translation, rotation/reflection, and scaling. In an earlier paper, the authors proposed statistical analysis of shape by considering logarithmic differences of all possible Euclidean distances between landmarks. Tests of significance for differences in the shape of objects and methods of discrimination between populations were developed with such data. In the present paper, the corresponding statistical methodology is developed by triangulation of the landmarks and by considering the angles as natural measurements of shape. This method is applied to the study of sexual dimorphism in hominids."
Heterochronic processes in human evolution: An ontogenetic analysis of the hominid pelvis,"['Berge, C', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,NA,APR 1998,26,"Changes in pelvic shape in human ontogeny and hominid phylogeny suggest that the heterochronic processes involved differ greatly from the neotenic process traditionally described in the evolution of the skull. The morphology of 150 juvenile and adult pelves of African apes, 60 juvenile and adult pelves of modern humans, two adult pelves and a juvenile hip bone of australopithecines (Sts 14, AL 288, MLD 7) was studied. Multivariate results, ontogenetic allometries, and growth curves confirm that the pelvic growth pattern in humans differs markedly from those of the African apes. The results permit the following conclusions. First, the appearance of a new feature (acetabulo-cristal buttress and cristal tubercle) at the time of human birth allows the addition of traits, such as the attainment of a proportionally narrower pelvis, with more sagittally positioned iliac blades. Pelvic proportions and orientation change progressively in early childhood as bipedalism is practiced. Other changes in pelvic proportions occur later with the adolescent growth spurt. Second, comparison of juvenile and adult australopithecines to modern humans indicates that 1) some pelvic traits of adult Australopithecus resemble those of neonate Homo; 2) the pelvic growth of Australopithecus was probably closer to that of apes, than to that of humans; and 3) prolonged growth in length of hindlimb and pelvis after sexual maturity seems to be a unique feature of Home. The position of the acetabulo-cristal buttress and of the cristal tubercle on the ilium are similar in adult Australopithecus and neonate Homo suggesting that this feature may have been displaced later during hominid evolution. Progressive displacement of the acetabulo-cristal buttress on the ilium occurs both during hominid evolution (from Australopithecus to Homo sapiens) and human growth (from neonate to adult). This suggests peramorphic evolution of the pelvic morphology of hominids combining three processes of recapitulation (pre-displacement, acceleration and time hypermorphosis). The results lend credence to the hypothesis that no single heterochronic process accounts for all human evolutionary change; rather this reflects a combination of relative changes in growth rhythm and duration, including other perturbations, such as the appearance of new morphological features.

Comparative mapping of the cri du chat and DiGeorge syndrome regions in the great apes,"['Tarazami, ST', 'Kringstein, AM', 'Conte, RA', 'Verma, RS']",GENES & GENETIC SYSTEMS,10.1266/ggs.73.135,APR 1998,1,"Structural variations between great ape and human chromosomes due to pericentric inversions and translocations have created at apparent controversy during the reconstruction of hominoid phylogeny. One such variation involves human chromosome 5, which is equivalent to chromosome 4 in chimpanzee and orangutan but equivalent to segments of chromosomes 4 and 19 in gorilla. Obviously, neither banding patterns nor centromeric indecies in these chromosomes match. The pathological condition of cri du chat syndrome is due to the cytogenetic deletion of band p15.2 of chromosome 5. Is this region involved during pericentric inversion of apes chromsome 4? We used a human cosmid probe for cri du chat syndrome as a phylogenetic marker in search of the aforementioned question. The genomic sequences for cri du chat syndrome region were conserved in chimpanzee (PTR4) and orangutan (PPY4) but displayed a positional divergence in gorilla on chromosome 19(GGO19). In addition, we used a human cosmid DNA probe for DiGeorge syndrome which is located on chromosome 22 band q11.2 and was conserved within band 23q11.2 in apes. The loci specific human genomic probes may help to describe the inversions and translocations for other chromsomes."

The survey included a total of 480 km of transects completed within seven sampling zones in the Kahuzi-Biega National park lowland sector and adjacent Kasese regions and approximately 1100 km of footpath and forest reconnaissance. We estimate total populations of 7670 (4180-10,830) weaned gorillas within the Kahuzi-Biega lowland sector and 3350 (1420-5950) individuals in the Kasese survey areas. Within the same area, we estimate a population of 2600 (1620-4500) chimpanzees. Ape nest site densities are significantly higher within the Kahuzi-Biega lowland sector than in the more remote Kasese survey area in spite of a significantly higher encounter rate of human sign within the lowland sector of the park. Comparison of our data with information obtained by Emlen and Schaller during the first rangewide survey of Grauer's gorillas in 1959 suggests that gorilla populations have remained stable in protected areas but declined in adjacent forest. These findings underscore the key role played by national parks in protecting biological resources in spite of the recent political and economic turmoil in the region. We also show that forest reconnaissance is a reliable and cost-effective method to assess gorilla densities in remote forested areas."
Origin of human chromosome 2 revisited,"['Samonte, RV', 'Ramesh, KH', 'Verma, RS']",JOURNAL OF GENETICS,10.1007/BF02933040,APR 1998,1,"Similarities in chromosome banding patterns and homologies in DNA sequence between chromosomes of the great apes and humans have suggested that human chromosome 2 originated through the fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes. A lot of work has been directed at understanding the nature and mechanism of this fusion. The recent availability of the human chromosome-2-specific alpha satellite DNA probe D2Z and the human chromosome-2p-specific subtelomeric DNA probe D2S445 prompted us to attempt cross-hybridization with chromosomes of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) to search for equivalent locations in the great apes and to comment on the origin of human chromosome 2. The probes gave different results. No hybridization to the chromosome-2-specific alpha satellite DNA probe was observed on the presumed homologous great ape chromosomes using both high-stringency and low-stringency post-hybridization washes, whereas the subtelomeric-DNA probe specific for chromosome 2p hybridized to telomeric sites of the short arm of chromosome 12 of all three great apes. These observations suggest an evolutionary difference in the number of alpha satellite DPI;A repeat units in the equivalent ape chromosomes presumably involved in the chromosome fusion. Nevertheless, complete conservation of DNA sequence of the subtelomeric repeat sequence D2S445 in the ape chromosomes is demonstrated."
Estimation of African ape body length from femur length,"['Hens, SM', 'Konigsberg, LW', 'Jungers, WL', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1997.0209,APR 1998,12,"The estimation from long bone lengths of stature in humans or body size in apes has a deep history in physical anthropology. To date, we can enumerate at least five different statistical methods for making such estimations. These methods are: (1) the regression of body length on long bone length (inverse calibration), (2) regression of long bone length on body length followed by solving for body length (classical calibration), (3) major axis regression of body length on long bone length, (4) reduced major axis regression of body length on long bone length, and (5) use of a long bone/body length ratio. We examine some of the statistical properties of these estimators using a large sample of humans (n=2053) to derive the estimators, and applying them to smaller samples of Pan troglodytes (n=42), Pan paniscus (n=8), and Gorilla gorilla (n=35).

Based on the root mean-squared error (RMSE), the reduced major axis is the preferred estimator for body length in the combined Pan sample. However, inverse calibration is the best estimator for body length in gorillas based on the RMSE. Many estimators grossly underestimate body length in the apes. Differences in allometries between humans and great apes are obvious, but it is important to show the assumptions necessary in estimating body size from fossil remains, especially when isolated long bones are recovered and the global allometry is consequently unknown.

Contrasting levels of DNA polymorphism at the autosomal and X-linked visual color pigment loci in humans and squirrel monkeys,"['Shimmin, LC', 'Miller, J', 'Tran, HN', 'Li, WH']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,APR 1998,6,"The X-linked color pigment (opsin) locus is known to be highly polymorphic in the squirrel monkey and other New World monkeys. To see whether this is also the case for the autosomal (blue) opsin locus, we obtained 32 squirrel monkey and 30 human blue opsin gene sequences. No amino acid polymorphism was found in either the squirrel monkey sample or the human sample, contrary to the situation at the X-linked opsin locus. This sharp contrast in the level of polymorphism might be due to differences in gene expression between the autosomal and the X-linked loci. At the X-linked locus, heterozygote advantage can occur because, owing to X-inactivation, the two alleles in a heterozygote are expressed in different cone cells, producing two types of cone cell, whereas at the autosomal locus, heterozygote advantage cannot occur because the two alleles in a heterozygote are expressed in the same cone cells, producing only one type of cone cell (i.e., phenotypically a homozygote). From the sequence data, the levels of nucleotide diversity (pi, i.e., the number of nucleotide differences per site) are estimated: for the human sample, pi = 0.00% per nondegenerate site, 0.00% per twofold degenerate site, and 0.04% per fourfold degenerate site in the coding regions and 0.01% per site in intron 4; for the squirrel monkey sample, pi = 0.00% per nondegenerate site, 0.00% per twofold degenerate site, and 0.15% per fourfold degenerate site in the coding regions and 0.17% per site in intron 4. The blue opsin genes from the common and pygmy chimpanzees, the gorilla, the capuchin, and the howler monkey were also sequenced. Features critical to the function of the opsin are well conserved in all known mammalian sequences. However, the interhelical loops are, on average, actually more conservative than the transmembrane helical regions. In addition, these sequence data and those from some other genes indicate that the common and pygmy chimpanzees are not closely related, their divergence date being from one third to one half the date of the human-chimpanzee divergence."
A hominoid-specific nuclear insertion of the mitochondrial D-loop: Implications for reconstructing ancestral mitochondrial sequences,"['Zischler, H', 'Geisert, H', 'Castresana, J']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,APR 1998,30,"A nuclear integration of a mitochondrial control region sequence on human chromosome 9 has been isolated. PCR analyses with primers specific for the respective insertion-flanking nuclear regions showed that the insertion took place on the lineage leading to Hominoidea (gibbon, orangutan, gorilla, chimpanzee, and human) after the Old World monkey-Hominoidea split. The sequences of the control region integrations were determined for humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and siamangs. These sequences were then used to construct phylogenetic trees with different methods, relating them with several hominoid, Old World monkey, and New World monkey mitochondrial control region sequences. Applying maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony algorithms, the insertion clade was attached to the branch leading to the hominoid mitochondrial sequences as expected from the PCR-determined presence/absence of this integration. An unexpected long branch leading to the internal node that connects all insertion sequences was observed for the different phylogeny reconstruction procedures. This finding is not totally compatible with the lower evolutionary rate in the nucleus than in the mitochondrial compartment. We determined the unambiguous substitutions on the branch leading to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the mitochondrial inserts according to the parsimony criterium. We propose that they are unlikely to have been caused by damage of the transposing nucleic acid and that they are probably due to a change in the evolutionary mode after the transposition."

Gorillas found in the Kahuzi-Biega lowland-Kasese represent 86 per cent of the subspecies's total population. Further, approximately 67 per cent of known Grauer's gorillas inhabit Kahuzi-Biega, Maiko and Virunga National Parks. The eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) has an extremely high human population growth rate indicating that deforestation and wildlife use trends will continue to increase. Thus, in spite of the encouraging results of surveys to identify populations and characterize abundance, no Grauer's gorilla population should be considered safe from extirpation."

Parentage assignments were confirmed by excluding all except a single potential sire for each offspring with at least two loci. Sire-offspring relationships were verified in 12 of the 14 cases, and reassigned in the case of two gorilla offspring. The orangutan paternity typing was supplemented by DNA fingerprinting. Additionally, five of the eight microsatellite loci, in conjunction with behavioral data, were used for a non-exhaustive set of paternity exclusions for five wild mountain gorillas (Gorilla g. beringei). The eight loci described in this study should be useful additions to the tools available for the study of genetics in the great apes."

Elephants, buffaloes, gorillas, sitatungas, bongos, forest hogs, and giant forest hogs were the most common visitors. At the Maya Nord clearing, the rates of presence of buffaloes, elephants and gorillas were particularly high (71%, 37% and 34% of the observation time respectively) while a group of sitatungas was resident.

Differences in the rates of clearing frequentation was found to result from several factors including the past hunting pressure on elephants. Forest clearings constitute an important food source for large mammals which enter clearings for mineral salts contained in soil, water and herbaceous vegetation. They are of great value to maintain the population densities of mammals as well as to develop ecotourism. However, they are also ideal sites for ivory poaching. The richest clearings we explored are not included within the limits of the park: extending these boundaries is a priority."
Towards an all-round approach to Hominid evolution,"['Chaline, J']",COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES SERIE II FASCICULE A-SCIENCES DE LA TERRE ET DES PLANETES,10.1016/S1251-8050(98)80300-5,MAR 1998,8,"Two models of diversification of the common ancestor of gorillas, chimpanzees and men can be proposed on the basis of the distribution of chromosomal rearrangements in extant species and reconsideration of the role played by climate. The small genetic divergence between chimpanzees and humans is greatly amplified at the morphological level, this constituting the 'human paradox'. This paradox is resolved by the economical and flexible evolutionary mechanism of mutations in regulator genes and the heterochronies they control, which are the true internal clocks of evolution. Changes in cranial morphology are quantified and used to analyse and explain the steps in the transition from great ape to human morphology. By comparison at the various stages of development, it is suggested that from great apes to modern man numerous heterochronies have occurred during ontogeny (hypermorphosis, hypomorphosis and post-displacements).

Impact of global warming on the distribution and survival of the gelada baboon: a modelling approach,"['Dunbar, RIM']",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,10.1046/j.1365-2486.1998.00156.x,MAR 1998,25,"The gelada baboon is a graminivorous primate whose ecology is unusually sensitive to ambient temperature. A systems model of the socio-ecology of the gelada is used to predict the impact of global warming on the species' altitudinal distribution. The species' lower altitudinal limit will rise by approximate to 500 m for every 2 degrees C increase in global mean temperature. A 7 degrees C rise in temperature would be sufficient to result in the species being confined to a small number of isolated mountain peaks, where its chances of survival will be greatly reduced. Changes in local climate are also likely to have significant effects on agricultural practice on the Ethiopian highlands, and this in turn is likely to have repercussions for the distribution patterns of the gelada by further constraining the habitat available to them."
Mitochondrial DNA variability in Grauer's gorillas of Kahuzi-Biega National Park,"['Saltonstall, K', 'Amato, G', 'Powell, J']",JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,10.1093/jhered/89.2.129,MAR-APR 1998,22,"Eastern lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla graueri) are the least studied of the three gorilla subspecies, particularly at the molecular level. We sequenced an internal region of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) region and a hypervariable portion of the mitochondrial DNA control region (D-loop) from wild gorillas in both the montane and lowland habitats of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, Democratic Republic of Congo, All individuals (n = 38) were identical at the COII region; this sequence indicates that diagnostic sites previously suggested for gorilla subspecies may be valid. Low variability was found within the D-loop region from a subset of the individuals (n = 15) sequenced for COII. Haplotype frequencies differed between the two habitats, suggesting a level of population subdivision that may have demographic consequences. These results also support the distinction of two distinct clades of gorillas comprised of western populations (G, g. gorilla) and eastern populations (G. g. graueri and G. g. beringei). Future management of Kahuzi-Biega National Park should ensure that sufficient habitat remains to prevent further genetic isolation of gorillas in the montane section of the park."
Human endogenous retrovirus K homologous sequences and their coding capacity in old world primates,"['Mayer, J', 'Meese, E', 'Mueller-Lantzsch, N']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,NA,MAR 1998,30,"The coding capacity for retroviral Gag and Env proteins has been maintained in human endogenous retroviruses of the HERV-K family. HERV-K homologous sequences have been found in all Old world primates, Here, we examined Old World primate species for the presence of full-length HERV-K gag and env genes and the presence of gag and env open reading frames as determined by the protein truncation test. Full-length HERV-K env genes were found in DNAs of all Old World primate species, whereas open reading frames for Env protein were found solely in human, chimpanzee; and gorilla DNAs. The mutational event leading to two HERV-K types was found to have occurred after the separation of hominids from lower Old World primates and before the expansion of hominids. Full length HERV-K gag genes in hominids displayed a 96-bp deletion compared to those in lon-er Old World primates. The ancient gag variant has not been maintained during hominid evolution. Open reading frames for HERV-K Gag have been found in all Old World primates except chimpanzees. Our study of the HERV-K family during Old World primate evolution contributes to the understanding of their possible biological functions in the host genomes."
Figurative and spatial information and search behavior in dogs (Canis familiaris),"['Dumas, C']",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,10.1016/S0376-6357(97)00071-5,FEB 1998,12,"Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) were administered a variant of the delayed matching-to-sample task in which they had to recover a hidden object and in which both spatial and figurative information were kept constant at the outset of each trial. Thereafter, either spatial (i.e. spatial condition) or figurative cues (i.e. figurative condition) became relevant to solve the task. The results revealed that dogs rapidly associated a spatial cue with the recovery of the object. The discussion emphasizes the role of cognitive and ecological constraints to account for the fact that figurative information was not readily used as a cue to guide search behavior.

Differences in free AA between three types of human milk were small. Milks of pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) contained the highest levels of total free AA (8634-20862 mu mol/l), while the milks of cows and sheep had the lowest levels of total free AA (1061-1357 mu mol/l). The milks of human subjects, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), elephants (Elephas maximus), horses and pigs had intermediate levels of total free AA (3069-7381 mu mol/l). Glutamic acid was the most abundant free AA in milks of human subjects (1339-2157 mu mol/l), non-human primates (423-2528 mu mol/l), elephants (1332 mu mol/l), horses (1119 mu mol/l), and cows (349 mu mol/l). Taurine was the most abundant free AA in milks of pinnipeds (5776-13643 mu mol/l), pigs (1238 mu mol/l), goats (1150 mu mol/l) and sheep (341 mu mol/l). Taurine was the second most abundant free AA in milks of human subjects and non-human primates, while histidine was the second most abundant free AA in milks of pinnipeds. Milks of each species had a distinctive free AA pattern which may reflect the relative importance of the free AA during early postnatal development."
"Post-conflict behaviour of wild olive baboons. I. Reconciliation, redirection and consolation","['Castles, DL', 'Whiten, A']",ETHOLOGY,NA,FEB 1998,55,"Observations of post-conflict interactions have provided important insights into primate social organization. In this study, the nature and determinants of post-conflict behaviour in a troop of wild olive baboons, Papio annbis, were investigated. Reconciliation was observed among all age-sex classes, occurring at a rate consistent with a relatively intolerant dominance style. Reconciliation was more frequent when one of the combatants carried a dependent infant but rarely followed conflicts associated with food. Neither the directionality nor the decidedness of conflicts affected conciliatory tendency. In contrast, opponents that were close kin or of similar rank reconciled more often. Olive baboons did not affiliate with non-combatants more frequently following aggression than in control periods, although affiliation with supporters and the close kin of opponents increased. Absence of consolation follows the observed cercopithecine pattern, consistent with the hypothesis that con solation requires an ability to empathize with the victim's distress. Initiation of post-conflict attacks on third parties was not elevated in victims of aggression. The rarity of redirection is attributed to spatial dispersion, the frequent bidirectionality of baboon aggression and regular male intervention in female conflicts, all of which appear to limit the availability of 'safe' targets."
Hand preference in free-ranging white-throated capuchins (Cebus capucinus) in Costa Rica,"['Panger, MA']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1023/A:1020367229148,FEB 1998,19,"I studied the hand preference patterns of individuals in three troops of white-throated capuchins (C. capucinus) in Pale Verde, Costa Rica, during 11 months from February 1995 to January 1996. I used focal and ad libitum sampling techniques and tested several frameworks that seek to explain and to predict primate hand use patterns via a variety of spontaneous tasks that differ in manipulative difficulty and required postural regulation: reach, tap, grab, carry, and object-use. The monkeys showed symmetrical hand use patterns for the easy tasks, reach and tap; strongly asymmetrical patterns for the highly manipulative task object-use, at the individual level; and weak population-level biases for tasks requiring a degree of postural regulation, carry. The results for data on grab are inconclusive. These results do not support the available primate hand use frameworks and differ from most of the captive literature on hand preference in Cebus. The findings indicate that postural regulation may influence hand use patterns in nonhuman primates at the population level."
Secnidazole vs. paromomycin: Comparative antiprotozoan treatment in captive primates,"['Gracenea, M', 'Gomez, MS', 'Fernandez, J', 'Feliu, C']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,NA,FEB 1998,3,"The antiprotozoan activity of secnidazole was studied in Cercocebus t. torquatus, Cercopithecus campbelli, Erythrocebus patas (Cercopithecidae), and Gorilla gorilla (Pongidae) compared with that of paromomycin in Cercocebus t. lunulatus (Cercopithecidae), E. paras, and G. gorilla (Pongidae) by coprological analysis. The antiprotozoan activity of both drugs depended on the parasite species and the host species. The drugs acted in a similar way on Entamoeba coli parasitising C. t. torquatus, and E. paras. This activity was different from that observed on I. buestchlii from the same host species. Nevertheless, E. coli parasitising cercopithecids and pongids responded to drugs differently."
Cardiovascular evaluation of lowland gorillas,"['Junge, RE', 'Mezei, LE', 'Muhlbauer, MC', 'Weber, M']",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,NA,FEB 1 1998,16,"Objective-To design a diagnostic protocol that uses appropriate techniques, including ultrasonography, to assess cardiovascular health and detect primary cardiac diseases in gorillas and to establish a database of reference values for cardiac measurements in clinically normal gorillas.

Design-Prospective study.

Animals-5 adult male lowland gorillas from 11 to 18 years old.

Procedure-A complete cardiac evaluation was performed on anesthetized gorillas, including physical examination, thoracic radiography, electrocardiography, echocardiography, blood pressure determination, CBC, serum biochemical analyses, and serologic assay for viral diseases. Standard cardiac measurements were made from images collected during ultrasonography.

Results-Cardiac measurements derived from ultrasonographic images were consistent with those considered normal in human beings. Results of other diagnostic tests were also considered normal.

Clinical Implications-Cardiac disease is the primary cause of mortality in old captive gorillas. The technique used here provided excellent evaluation of cardiac function. Use of these techniques will allow early detection of cardiac disease, making treatment or medical management possible."
Evolutionary sequence comparisons using high-density oligonucleotide arrays,"['Hacia, JG', 'Makalowski, W', 'Edgemon, K', 'Erdos, MR', 'Robbins, CM', 'Fodor, SPA', 'Brody, LC', 'Collins, FS']",NATURE GENETICS,10.1038/ng0298-155,FEB 1998,83,"We explored the utility of high-density oligonucleotide arrays (DNA chips) for obtaining sequence information from homologous genes in closely related species. Orthologues of the human BRCA1 exon 11, all approximately 3.4 kb in length and ranging from 98.2% to 83.5% nucleotide identity, were subjected to hybridization-based and conventional dideoxysequencing analysis. Retrospective guidelines for identifying high-fidelity hybridization-based sequence calls were formulated based upon dideoxysequencing results. Prospective application of these rules yielded base-calling with at least 98.8% accuracy over orthologous sequence tracts shown to have approximately 99% identity. For higher primate sequences with greater than 97% nucleotide identity, base-calling was made with at least 99.91% accuracy covering a minimum of 97% of the sequence. Using a second-tier confirmatory hybridization chip strategy, shown in several cases to confirm the identity of predicted sequence changes, the complete sequence of the chimpanzee. gorilla and orangutan orthologues should be deducible solely through hybridization-based methodologies. Analysis of less highly conserved orthologues can still identify conserved nucleotide tracts of at least 15 nucleotides and can provide useful information for designing primers. DNA-chip based assays can be a valuable new technology for obtaining high-throughput cost-effective sequence information from related genomes."
Allelic diversity at the primate MHC-DMB locus: presence of a conserved tyrosine inhibitory motif in the cytoplasmic tail,"['Alvarez, M', 'Recio, MJ', 'Martinez-Laso, J', 'Perez-Blas, M', 'Garcia-de-la-Torre, C', 'Vargas-Alarcon, G', 'Alegre, R', 'Gomez-Casado, E', 'Arnaiz-Villena, A']",TISSUE ANTIGENS,NA,FEB 1998,2,"Ten new primate Mhc-DMB complete cDNA sequences have been obtained in chimpanzee (n=four), gorilla (,n=three) and orangutan (n=three); this gene has not been previously studied in these species, Exonic allelism has been recorded all along the molecule domains and also in the leader peptide, but not in the transmembrane segment. An analysis of the residues critical in the conformation of the Mhc-DR peptide-binding site was done in order to look for a Mhc-DR homologue site; synonymous substitutions are favoured in this homologous HLA-DM region. This is another finding that supports the possibility that DM could not be typically pn presenting molecules. The immunoreceptor inhibition motif Tyr 230-Thr/Ser 231-Pro 232-Leu 233 (ITIM) is invariantly present in apes for at least 15 million years, and may have a double function: 1) To direct DMB-DMA molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum or cell surface towards the endosomal/lysosomal class II compartment and 2) to send an inhibitory signal to the cell in order to stop synthesis of unnecessary HLA-DR molecules, once all available antigenic peptides are loaded. Other molecules, like NK-cell receptors and Fc receptors, bear this type of tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in order to switch off specific cell functions. DMB molecules (as previously shown in C4d molecules) do not present species-specific motifs in common chimpanzee, suggesting that this species is very close to gorilla or man, also, DMB, like C4d molecules, do not show a trans-species evolution pattern, suggesting the existence of extensive homogenization of DMB genes within each species or a recent generation of alleles. Finally, a clade grouping human and gorilla DMB cDNA sequences is obtained using a dendrogram (as for C4d nees); this is in contrast to others' results that obtain a human/chimpanzee clade using different DNA sequences."
Lowland gorillas and seed dispersal: The importance of nest sites,"['Rogers, ME', 'Voysey, BC', 'McDonald, KE', 'Parnell, RJ', 'Tutin, CEG']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1098-2345(1998)45:1<45::AID-AJP5>3.0.CO;2-W,1998,40,"Lowland gorillas eat the fruit and disperse the seeds of many tree species in the Lope Reserve, Gabon. This study aimed to show whether deposition of seeds at gorilla ground nest sites conferred any advantage for germination and seedling establishment as compared to the fate of seeds deposited in gorilla dung on trails or under parents, Four tree species were chosen for study, which had a range of fruit types and fruiting patterns but which were all important foods for gorillas. Data showed that gorillas removed significant quantities of seeds from all four species and deposited them in dung at nest sites or on trail. Nest sites were not always favorable for germination, but the most favorable sites permitted the best survival and growth of any of the seedlings, including those deposited in dung on trail or scatter-dispersed under or away from parent canopies. Initial performance in the first few weeks after deposition was not always indicative of long-term survival and growth, so data collection over 1-2 years was absolutely essential. The main factors affecting seedling fate at nest sites appeared to be vegetation cover and desiccation. It is suggested that the nesting habits of gorillas are an additional factor encouraging the successful establishment of seedlings over and above the obvious advantages of large body size, gut capacity, and extended day ranges.

Geophagy as a therapeutic mediator of endoparasitism in a free-ranging group of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta),"['Knezevich, M']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1098-2345(1998)44:1<71::AID-AJP6>3.0.CO;2-U,1998,43,"Parasite levels were determined for 141 members of a naturally formed social group of rhesus macaques living under free-ranging conditions. Results indicate that group members harbor Trichuris trichiura, Balantidium coli, and large numbers of Strongyloides fuelleborni. Parasite counts decrease significantly with age in this population. Females have significantly fewer parasites than males and a significantly lower prevalence of multiple infections. There were no rank effects regarding parasitosis. While 89% of the animals examined are infected with one or more species of enteric parasite, the prevalence of diarrhea is negligible (2%). The low prevalence of diarrhea in the presence of high parasite loads may be due to the practice of geophagy, which is engaged in by 76% of group members. Soil eaten by these monkeys contains large amounts of kaolinitic clays. Kaolin-based pharmaceuticals (i.e. Kaopectate(R)) are commonly used in human populations to treat diarrhea and intestinal upsets. The mechanical and pharmaceutical properties of the natural kaolinite-based clays may counteract the effects of parasitosis in this free-ranging population. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Effects of upright posture on hand preference for reaching vs. the use of probing tools by tufted capuchins (Cebus apella),"['Westergaard, GC', 'Kuhn, HE', 'Suomi, SJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/(SICI)1098-2345(1998)44:2<147::AID-AJP5>3.0.CO;2-W,1998,5,"This research examined the effects of task (reaching vs. tool use) and posture (quadrupedal vs. bipedal) on hand preference in tufted capuchins (Cebus apella). Regarding direction of hand preference, we found a significant main effect of posture, as the bipedal stance elicited greater use of the right hand than did the quadrupedal stance, and a significant posture x task interaction, as bipedal reaching elicited greater use of the right hand than did other postural and task conditions. Further, we found a significant main effect of task on strength of hand preference, as tool use elicited more consistent use of one hand over the other than did reaching. Our findings indicate that bipedal reaching facilitates a mild right-hand bias in intensely manipulative primates. We speculate that this moderate bias may have been pushed in the direction of nearly exclusive right-hand preference in most humans with the development of complex tool use.

Evolutionary and Functional Significance of Hominoid Tooth Enamel,"['Gantt, DG', 'Rafter, JA']",CONNECTIVE TISSUE RESEARCH,10.3109/03008209809023927,1998,6,"The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate enamel thickness in extant and extinct hominoids. The material used in this study spans the evolutionary history of this group, from 20 million years ago to the present. The objectives of this investigation are to test three hypotheses: (1) the Loading Hypothesis: loading areas of the crown have thicker enamel than non-loading areas; (2) the Phyletic Hypothesis: differences in enamel thickness provide a basis for determining evolutionary relationships; and (3) the Functional Hypothesis: differences among hominoids result from adaptations to differing dietary and ecological habitats, that is from folivory to frugivory to hard object feeding and from tropical to forest to savanna habitats. Thin sections were prepared and polished to approximately 100 mu m in thickness. Each section was then enlarged and digitally captured to the computer. Image processing and analysis software, SigmaImage (TM) (was used to measure the sections. Subsequent statistical analysis was conducted with SigmaStat (TM) and SPSS (TM) statistical software programs. The data provides statistical support for all hypotheses. In particular, the data support the proposal that ""thick"" enamel is the ancestral condition for the great apes and human clade. Therefore, Pongo would have retained its enamel thickness from the common ancestor of the great apes and Gorilla and Pun would have secondarily reduced enamel thickness to ""thin."" The common ancestor of the hominids, the australopithecines, would have ""thick"" enamel. The ""hyper-thick"" enamel of the australopithecines would be a derived character for this clade due to increased crushing and grinding and adaptation to savanna habitat. Homo would have secondarily reduced enamel thickness to ""thick"" Evolutionary biology of enamel differs markedly in hominids from that found in other hominoids and primates. Increased enamel thickness involved both increases in absolute thickness of enamel and crown size in response to increase masticatory loading."

Orthologous regions were found by FISH analysis of metaphase chromosomes from Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Pongo pygmaeus. Only one orthologous region was detected in chromosomes of P.pygmaeus, showing that the original locus was at 21q22.1 and that the duplication arose after the separation of Asian orangutans from the other hominoids. Surprisingly, the paralogous regions were more highly conserved in gorilla than in chimpanzee. PCR amplification of STSs derived from sequences of the chromosome 21 loci and low-stringency FISH analysis showed that this duplication occurred recently in the evolution of the genome. Different rates of sequence evolution through substitutions or deletions, after the duplication, may have resulted in diversity between closely related primates."

Only one specimen of western lowland gorilla investigated showed an additional hybridization site at the telomeric short arm of one chromosome 1, From our own results and those in the literature, it is clear that the additional rDNA site on chromosome 1 must be regarded as a rare polymorphism in the subspecies of western lowland gorilla, possibly going back to a founder translocation event."

Analyses of cross species polymerase chain reaction products to infer the ancestral state of human polymorphisms,"['Iyengar, S', 'Seaman, M', 'Deinard, AS', 'Rosenbaum, HC', 'Sirugo, G', 'Castiglione, CM', 'Kidd, JR', 'Kidd, KK']",DNA SEQUENCE,10.3109/10425179809034076,1998,30,"In numerous population genetic and disease association studies decisions about the ancestry of polymorphic alleles are often made based on the relative frequency of the alleles in the extant populations with the most frequent allele being deemed as ancestral. However, the frequency of an allele in a population is generally not a perfect indicator of its ancestral status. A more accurate method to assess ancestral/derived status of polymorphic alleles involves identification of shared alleles between species. We used this strategy to examine genomic regions homologous to several human polymorphisms in four species of non-human primates. Cross species polymerase chain reaction (CS-PCR), with primers designed from human sequence, was used to investigate regions of interest. Nineteen polymorphisms at six loci (DRD2, HOXB@, PAH, D4S10, RBP3 and RET) were examined either by restriction fragment length analysis of PCR products (PCR-RFLP) or by direct sequencing. At seventeen of the eighteen PCR-RFLPs, non-human primates were monomorphic and identical to each other for either lack of restriction enzyme site or presence of the site. Thus, at these seventeen polymorphic sites the shared alleles are most likely to be the ancestral ones in humans. In several cases we have used sequence data to further demonstrate that the nucleotide at the site of the polymorphism is conserved between species confirming the hypothesis of a single ancestral allele. However, not all human alleles can be simply resolved into ancestral and derived; sequence data from one PCR-RFLP (in an intron of the PAH locus) and a single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the DRD2 gene illustrate this point."
The effects of a change in leadership in a breeding group of western lowland gorillas Gorilla g. gorilla at the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust,"['Johnstone-Scott, RA']",DODO-JOURNAL OF THE WILDLIFE PRESERVATION TRUSTS,NA,1998,0,"This paper presents a descriptive summary of the significant events which took place during a change in leadership of the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust's group of western lowland gorillas Gorilla g. gorilla. Following the death of the founder male in 1992, the group experienced a partial breakdown of its social structure. This was temporarily rectified under female leadership, prior to the introduction of a new male in 1993. The integration of the blackbacked male into an established breeding group, although initially problematic, influenced change within the female hierarchy, and subsequently led to the siring of a male infant from the youngest female. Whilst certain social relationships with the maturing male improved, others deteriorated, to the extent that the removal by transfer of two sexually mature females became necessary. Problems incurred at that time, both behavioural and medical, are described. Despite a marked improvement in group compatibility, the level of sexual activity among higher ranking females remained poor, and consequently a reproductive research project was initiated to investigate this problem. Details of the latter are given, along with observations on change in behavioural response to the new male, management strategies, maturation, dominance related behaviour, female transfer, sexual behaviour and oestrous cyclicity."

Part of the difficulty can be attributed to the changing nature of our views about the course of hominoid evolution. In the 1950s and 1960s, individual Miocene taxa were commonly viewed as the direct ancestors of specific living ape species, suggesting an early divergence of the modern lineages.(1-5) However, in most cases, the Miocene forms were essentially ""dental apes,"" resembling extant species in dental and a few cranial features, but possessing more primitive postcranial features that suggested arboreal quadrupedalism rather than suspensory habits. With the introduction of molecular methods of phylogenetic reconstruction and the increasing use of cladistic analysis, it has become apparent that the radiation leading to the modern hominoids was somewhat more recent than had been believed, and that most of the Miocene hominoid species had little to do with the evolutionary history of the living apes.(6)"

Gorilla ecology and behavior","['Doran, DM', 'McNeilage, A']",EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY,NA,1998,95,"Many factors influence the evolution of primate grouping patterns, including phylogeny, demographic and life-history variables, and ecological factors such as access to food, predation pressure, and avoidance of infanticide. The interaction between these factors determines social organization.(1) Because western lowland and mountain gorillas differ so dramatically in their habitats and foraging strategies, they provide a valuable opportunity to assess how changes in ecology influence this balance. Mountain gorillas live in high-altitude montane forests, are herbivorous, and live in stable and cohesive groups. Western lowland gorillas live in lowland rainforest and are much more frugivorous than mountain gorillas. It is not yet clear to what extent incorporating significant quantities of fruit in the diet influences western lowland gorilla sociality because they have been studied much less than have mountain gorillas. However, what is known about their behavior hints that there may also be considerable differences in their social organization, including changes in group size and cohesion and in the frequency and type of intergroup encounters. Gorillas thus provide a unique opportunity to reevaluate proposed models of ecological influences on social organization in African apes."
Members of the olfactory receptor gene family are contained in large blocks of DNA duplicated polymorphically near the ends of human chromosomes,"['Trask, BJ', 'Friedman, C', 'Martin-Gallardo, A', 'Rowen, L', 'Akinbami, C', 'Blankenship, J', 'Collins, C', 'Giorgi, D', 'Iadonato, S', 'Johnson, F', 'Kuo, WL', 'Massa, H', 'Morrish, T', 'Naylor, S', 'Nguyen, OTH', 'Rouquier, S', 'Smith, T', 'Wong, DJ', 'Youngblom, J', 'van den Engh, G']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/7.1.13,JAN 1998,153,"We have identified three new members of the olfactory receptor (OR) gene family within a large segment of DNA that is duplicated with high similarity near many human telomeres, This segment is present at 3q, 15q, and 19p in each of 45 unrelated humans sampled from various populations, Additional copies are present polymorphically at 11 other subtelomeric locations, The frequency with which the block is present at some locations varies among populations, While humans carry seven to 11 copies of the OR-containing block, it is located in chimpanzee and gorilla predominantly at a single site, which is not orthologous to any of the locations in the human genome, The observation that sequences flanking the OR-containing segment are duplicated on larger and different sets of chromosomes than the OR block itself demonstrates that the segment is part of a much larger, complex patchwork of subtelomeric duplications, The population analyses and structural results suggest the types of processes that have shaped these regions during evolution. From its sequence, one of the OR genes in this duplicated block appears to be potentially functional, Our findings raise the possibility that functional diversity in the OR family is generated in part through duplications and inter-chromosomal rearrangements of the DNA near human telomeres."
Characterization of chimpanzee TCRV gene polymorphism: how old are human TCRV alleles?,"['Jaeger, EEM', 'Bontrop, RE', 'Parham, P', 'Wickings, EJ', 'Kadwell, M', 'Lanchbury, JS']",IMMUNOGENETICS,NA,JAN 1998,10,"The functional relevance of the majority of human T-cell receptor A and B variable region gene polymorphisms is controversial. Studies of human and nonhuman primate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II polymorphisms show that allelic lineages predate human speciation and indicate that selection favors the long-term maintenance of these advantageous mutations. We investigated at the DNA level whether 15 human TCRA and B polymorphisms exist in contemporary chimpanzee populations. Polymorphisms consisted of variable region replacements, a recombination signal sequence base change, and silent mutations. With one exception, none of these human TCR polymorphisms were observed in contemporary chimpanzees. Investigation of the same polymorphisms in a range of other nonhuman primates showed little evidence of the existence of human polymorphism prespeciation. Chimpanzee TCRAV and BV regions were however polymorphic for variation so far not observed in human groups. Levels of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence variation in contemporary chimpanzees suggest that population bottlenecks have not been a feature of chimpanzee evolution and it is therefore probable that most human TCR polymorphisms have evolved in the estimated five million years since the speciation of human and chimpanzees. Thus, over the evolutionary time period studied, ancient TCRA and B polymorphisms have not been maintained by selection to the same degree as postulated for MHC polymorphisms."
Effects of selected behavioral enrichment devices on behavior of Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla).,"['Rooney, M B', 'Sleeman, J']",Journal of applied animal welfare science : JAAWS,10.1207/s15327604jaws0104_2,1998,8,"Environmental complexity plays an integral role in the activity and psychological well-being of primates. The experiment described in this article evaluates the effects of nonintrusive, inexpensive, and easily managed behavioral enrichment devices on the behavior of a group of captive Western lowland gorillas. Devices used included cardboard boxes containing food items, paper bags containing food items, burlap rags, and willow and maple browse. The enrichment devices increased foraging, social play, and solitary play behaviors. Sedentary behaviors decreased. Rags, bags, browse, and boxes did not statistically decrease the incidence of regurgitation/reingestation or coprophagy. Depending on the type of enrichment item used, the effects on agonism and manipulation of enrichment item were variable. To make informed management decisions about the psychological well-being of captive animals, it is important to objectively quantify and examine the influences on their behavior."
"Variation in tooth morphology of Gorilla gorilla
","['Uchida, A']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1006/jhev.1997.0186,JAN 1998,36,"Gorilla gorilla exemplifies a species that shows considerable variation in habitat, behaviour, genetic structure and morphology. This study examines variation of dental morphology in gorillas. Despite the marked size dimorphism, there are no significant shape differences between the sexes within subspecies. Differences in dental morphology, including tooth cusp proportions between the western G. g. gorilla and the eastern G. g. beringei are considerable. Although more similar to G. g. beringei than to the western G. g. gorilla, G. g. graueri also shows distinct morphological features. This indicates that the morphology of G. g. graueri is not merely intermediate, and genetic isolation between the two eastern subspecies could have had a substantial influence. Such extensive variation in dental morphology in Gorilla gorilla can be considered to be the result of an interesting combination of factors, including local dietary adaptations.

Molecular phylogenetics of the hominoid Y chromosome,"['Samonte, RV', 'Conte, RA', 'Verma, RS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS,10.1007/s100380050066,1998,2,"The Human Y-chromosome plays a central role in sex determination, and is composed of DNA sequences homologous to the Y-chromosome, families of Y-specific repetitive DNA sequences, and single copy sequences. We investigated the chromosomal location of Y-specific DNA sequences, in the chimpanzee (Prm troglodytes), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique. The Yq subtelomeric DNA sequences (DYS427) have been observed to be intact at the presumed loci. Also, the amelogenin gene (AMELY, Yp11.2) revealed sequence homology and positional conservation in the higher primates, except in gorilla where positional divergence was observed."
Concerted evolution of members of the multisequence family chAB4 located on various nonhomologous chromosomes,"['Assum, G', 'Pasantes, J', 'Glaser, B', 'Schempp, W', 'Wohr, G']",MAMMALIAN GENOME,10.1007/s003359900680,JAN 1998,5,"During the last years it became obvious that a lot of families of long-range repetitive DNA elements are located within the genomes of mammals. The principles underlying the evolution of such families, therefore, may have a greater impact than anticipated on the evolution of the mammalian genome as a whole. One of these families, called chAB4, is represented with about 50 copies within the human and the chimpanzee genomes and with only a few copies in the genomes of gorilla, orang-utan, and gibbon. Members of chAB4 are located on 10 different human chromosomes. FISH of chAB4-specific probes to chromosome preparations of the great apes showed that chAB4 is located, with only one exception, at orthologous places in the human and the chimpanzee genome. About half the copies in the human genome belong to two species-specific subfamilies that evolved after the divergence of the human and the chimpanzee lineages. The analysis of chAB4-specific PCR-products derived from DNA of rodent/human cell hybrids showed that members of the two human-specific subfamilies can be found on 9 of the 10 chAB4-carrying chromosomes. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the members of DNA sequence families can evolve as a unit despite their location at multiple sites on different chromosomes. The concerted evolution of the family members is a result of frequent exchanges of DNA sequences between copies located on different chromosomes. Interchromosomal exchanges apparently take place without greater alterations in chromosome structure."
A preliminary study of selective visual attention in female mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei),"['Watts, DP']",PRIMATES,10.1007/BF02557744,JAN 1998,19,"Visually attending to conspecifics can give group-living primates important ecological information, help them to anticipate the behavior of others and to regulate interactions with them, and provide other valuable social information. Variation in the importance and quality of social relationships should influence the way individuals selectively attend to fellow group members. Preliminary data on visual monitoring of conspecifics by wild female mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) show that selective attention mirrors variation in social relationships. Social bonds between males and females are central to gorilla society; correspondingly, females are more likely to stop feeding and focus their attention on males who walk into view than on females, especially when males give displays. Females are more likely to focus on other females with whom they have antagonistic relationships than those (mostly close relatives) with whom they have affiliative, cooperative ones. Further research on the context and consequences of visual monitoring could help to address questions about the regulation of social relationships and about social cognition in gorillas."
Characterization of a macaque anti-Rh17-like monoclonal antibody,"['Blancher, A', 'Roubinet, F', 'Reid, ME', 'Socha, WW', 'Bailly, P', 'Benard, P']",VOX SANGUINIS,NA,1998,6,"In order to produce macaque monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human red blood cell (RBC) antigens, macaques were immunized with human and gorilla RBCs and their spleen lymphocytes were fused with man-mouse heteromyeloma cells. One macaque-mouse heterohybridoma produced a macaque IgGx, (Cyn2-4D5) which agglutinated all human RBCs but not rare human variants Dc-, D--, and Rh-null. Thus, Cyn2-4D5 exhibited RH17-like reactivity. The specificity of Cyn2-4D5 for RHCE-encoded polypeptides was confirmed by specific immunoprecipitation of RhcE and RhCe polypeptides from human RBCs and the absence of immunoprecipitation of the RhD polypeptides extracted from D-- RBCs. This study demonstrates that it is possible to produce macaque mAbs against human RBC blood group antigens."
