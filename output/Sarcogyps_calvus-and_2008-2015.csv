Have population declines in Egyptian Vulture and Red-headed Vulture in India slowed since the 2006 ban on veterinary diclofenac?,"['Galligan, TH', 'Amano, T', 'Prakash, VM', 'Kulkarni, M', 'Shringarpure, R', 'Prakash, N', 'Ranade, S', 'Green, RE', 'Cuthbert, RJ']",BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL,10.1017/S0959270913000580,SEP 2014,3,"Populations of three vulture species of the genus Gyps, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus and Red-headed Vulture Sarcogyps calvus have declined markedly on the Indian subcontinent since the mid-1990s and all are now Critically Endangered or Endangered. Gyps vultures have been killed by the widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, ingested when they feed on carcasses of domesticated ungulates treated with the drug shortly before death. However, it is not known whether Egyptian Vulture and Red-headed Vulture are also sensitive to diclofenac. Veterinary use of diclofenac was banned in India in 2006. Since then, the prevalence and concentration of diclofenac in domesticated ungulates carcasses has decreased and population declines of Gyps vultures have slowed or reversed. Here, we examine counts of Egyptian and Red-headed Vultures obtained on road transects in and near protected areas between 1992 and 2011. We found indications that the declines in both species appear to have slowed and possibly increased after the ban was introduced, though the small numbers of birds counted make this conclusion less robust than that for the Gyps species. These results suggest that both species may have been adversely impacted by diclofenac and that government bans on this drug, which are beginning to take effect, may benefit a wider range of vulture species in the Indian subcontinent than was previously thought."
"Development of microsatellite markers and a restriction endonuclease digest assay for non-invasive sampling of endangered White-rumped, Slender-billed and Red-headed vultures","['Kapetanakos, YA', 'Lovette, IJ', 'Katzner, TE']",CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES,10.1007/s12686-014-0186-8,SEP 2014,0,"Southeast Asian vultures have been greatly reduced in range and population numbers, but it is challenging to use traditional tagging and monitoring techniques to track changes in their populations. Genotypes derived from non-invasively collected feather samples provide an alternative and effective means to 'capture' individual vultures for mark-recapture analyses. We describe a restriction endonuclease digest assay that distinguishes the visually similar feathers of three species of critically endangered Asian vultures (Gyps bengalensis, G. tenuirostris, and Sarcogyps calvus). In addition, we describe a panel of eight polymorphic microsatellite loci. In combination, the restriction endonuclease assay and microsatellite marker set developed here are powerful molecular tools for investigating the genetic and demographic status of these Asian vultures species."
"Birds of Mondulkiri, Cambodia: distribution, status and conservation","['Gray, TNE', 'Pollard, EHB', 'Evans, TD', 'Goes, F', 'Grindley, M', 'Omaliss, K', 'Nielsen, PH', 'Sambovannak, O', 'Channa, P', 'Sophoan, S']",FORKTAIL,NA,2014,0,"Since the late 1990s conservation activities have been carried out in a protected area complex centred on Mondulkiri province, eastern Cambodia. We provide a comprehensive bird list for this area and information on the status and distribution of all globally threatened, near threatened and restricted-range species. The total of 374 species includes 5 Critically Endangered, 3 Endangered, 7 Vulnerable and 16 Near Threatened species as well as five species recorded for the first time in Cambodia. Three main forest types-deciduous dipterocarp, lowland evergreen and semi-evergreen, and hill evergreen-each have distinctive avian communities. Evergreen forests on the Vietnam border comprise probably the largest least-disturbed lowland forests in the southern Annamites. There are important populations of several restricted-range and biome-restricted species. The area's populations of Green Peafowl Pavo muticus, White-rumped Vulture Gyps bengalensis, Slender-billed Vulture G. Tenuirostris, Red-headed Vulture Sarcogyps calvus, White-shouldered Ibis Pseudibis davisoni and Giant Ibis Thaumatibis gigantea are evidently of high global conservation importance. Further surveys are required to clarify the status of a number of other potentially important species, including Masked Finfoot Heliopais personata, White-winged Duck Cairina scutulata and Sarus Crane Grus antigone. Major threats to the area include habitat loss, both unplanned encroachment and large-scale plantations, infrastructure development and hunting. Active conservation management is reducing these threats."
"Vultures in Cambodia: population, threats and conservation","['Clements, T', 'Gilbert, M', 'Rainey, HJ', 'Cuthbert, R', 'Eames, JC', 'Bunnat, P', 'Teak, S', 'Chansocheat, S', 'Setha, T']",BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL,10.1017/S0959270912000093,MAR 2013,3,"Asian vultures have undergone dramatic declines of 90-99% in the Indian Subcontinent, as a consequence of poisoning by veterinary use of the drug diclofenac, and are at a high risk of extinction. Cambodia supports one of the only populations of three species (White-rumped Vulture Gyps bengalensis, Slender-billed Vulture G. tenuirostris and Red-headed Vulture Sarcogyps calvus) outside of South Asia where diclofenac use is not widespread. Conservation of the Cambodian sub-populations is therefore a global priority. This study analyses the results of a long-term research programme into Cambodian vultures that was initiated in 2004. Population sizes of each species are estimated at 50-200+ individuals, ranging across an area of approximately 300 km by 250 km, including adjacent areas in Laos and Vietnam. The principal causes of vulture mortality were poisoning (73%), probably as an accidental consequence of local hunting and fishing practices, and hunting or capture for traditional medicine (15%). This represents a significant loss from such a small population of long-lived, slow breeding, species such as vultures. Cambodian vultures are severely food limited and are primarily dependent on domestic ungulate carcasses, as wild ungulate populations have been severely depleted over the past 20 years. Local people across the vulture range still follow traditional animal husbandry practices, including releasing livestock into the open deciduous dipterocarp forest areas when they are not needed for work, providing the food source. Reducing threats through limiting the use of poisons (which are also harmful for human health) and supplementary food provisioning in the short to medium-term through 'vulture restaurants' is critical if Cambodian vultures are to be conserved."
