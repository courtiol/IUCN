Clotting profiles and selected hematology of captive Speke's gazelles (Gazella spekei),"['Travis, EK', 'Eby, C']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/05-007.1,MAR 2006,3,"Manual restraint and jugular venipuncture were used to obtain blood for hematology and coagulation tests for 18 captive Speke's gazelles (Gazella spekei). The hematocrit and hemoglobin values were slightly higher in Speke's gazelles than in domestic ruminants. The Speke's gazelles had a mean prothrombin time of 15.1 sec and a mean activated partial thromboplastin time of 24.2 sec. The pregnant female Speke's gazelles had shorter activated partial thromboplastin times than the males, but the difference was not significant. Ideally, prothrombin times and activated partial thromboplastin times would be compared to a healthy conspecific during a suspected bleeding crisis. Baseline prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times are presented here for Speke's gazelles because clotting times for exotic hoofstock are quite limited."
Serum biochemistry parameters in captive gazelle species,"['Hammer, S', 'Hammer, C', 'Schulz, J', 'Wernery, U', 'Clauss, M']",TIERAERZTLICHE PRAXIS AUSGABE GROSSTIERE NUTZTIERE,NA,2006,3,"Objective: This study aimed at comparing serum parameters of clinically healthy gazelles of Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation (AWWP), Qatar, with reference ranges of domestic and other wild ruminants, in order to gain, on the one hand, insight into the nutritional status of the animals, and, on the other hand, to establish reference ranges for the investigated species. Material and methods: Serum biochemistry parameters and mineral levels were measured in 250 clinically healthy individuals of the species Soemmering's gazelle (Gazella soemmerringii), Speke's gazelle (Gazella spekei), Dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), Saudi gazelle (Gazella saudiya), Mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), Arabian goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa marica) and Chinkara Pakistani gazelle (Gazella benetti). Results: With respect to the nutritional status, the supplementation with trace elements (selenium, copper, zinc, iron) was adequate at AWWP according to measured serum levels. In contrast, serum levels of phosphorus, total protein and albumin indicated a suboptimal feeding situation, most likely due to the low quality of the roughage available in the region. The levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, choride, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, ALT- as well as GGT avtivity were -as in other wild ruminants-within the reference range of domestic ruminants, which therefore should be applicable to ruminants in general. The contents of glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase and ALP, in contrast, seem to be generally elevated in wild ruminants. While other wild ruminants display an AST activity comparable to those of domestic ruminants, gazelles of both this and other studies had elevated values of this enzyme. Conclusion and clinical relevance: These peculiarities need to be accounted for when interpreting blood values."
Hypophosphatemia associated with hypovitaminosis-D in Speke's gazelles (Gazella spekei),"['Weber, MA', 'Junge, RE']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,SEP 2001,1,"Two juvenile male Speke's gazelles (Gazella spekei) at the St. Louis Zoo showed poor body condition, slowed growth, hunched stance, rough hair coat, and profound hypophosphatemia. The first gazelle was treated with parenteral phosphorous supplements but continued to deteriorate clinically and was euthanatized. The second gazelle had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of 0 nmol/L and was treated with i.m. injections of vitamin D. It died shortly after starting therapy. The only significant necropsy finding was multiple rib fractures in various stages of healing. Hypovitaminosis D has been confirmed in multiple Speke's gazelles in this collection, indicating possible deficiencies in the diet or in the amount of ultraviolet light available to the gazelles."
Inbreeding depression in the Speke's gazelle captive breeding program,"['Kalinowski, ST', 'Hedrick, PW', 'Miller, PS']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.98209.x,OCT 2000,39,"The Speke's gazelle (Gazella spekei) captive breeding program has been presented as one of the few examples of selection reducing the genetic load of a population and as a potential model for the captive breeding of endangered species founded from a small number of individuals. In this breeding program, three generations of mate selection apparently increased the viability of inbred individuals. We reanalyzed the Speke's gazelle studbook and examined potential causes for the reduction of inbreeding depression. Our analysis indicates that the decrease in inbreeding depression is not consistent with any model of genetic improvement in the herd. Instead, we found that the effect of inbreeding decreased from severe to moderate during the first generation of inbreeding, and that this change is responsible for almost all of the decline in inbreeding depression observed during the breeding program, This eliminates selection as a potential explanation for the decrease in inbreeding depression and suggests that inbreeding depression may be more sensitive to environmental influences than is usually thought."
