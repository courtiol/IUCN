"The breeding biology of the southern barred minnow Opsaridium peringueyi (Gilchrist and Thompson 1913) in the Incomati and Luvuvhu river systems, South Africa","['Fouche, PSO', 'Venter, JA']",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE,10.2989/16085914.2011.589110,2011,0,"Data collected at two sites in the Luvuvhu and Sabie rivers show that, based on the gonadosomatic index, Opsaridium peringueyi has one major annual breeding event that occurs in early summer, following a period during which the general condition of fish improves. Visual observation and microscopic measurement of oocyte sizes show that females reached sexual maturity at a fork length of c. 70 mm. Males were mature at a fork length of c. 60 mm. Measured ovum diameters showed ova up to a maximum of 1.8 mm in diameter, while egg counts showed that the species has a relatively low total fecundity."
"An investigation into the factors affecting the natural reproduction of Opsaridium peringueyi
","['Moyo, NAG']",PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH,10.1016/j.pce.2011.07.056,2011,1,"An endangered freshwater fish, Opsaridium peringueyi, was studied from January, 2009 to December, 2009. The analysis of the environmental conditions indicated that the fish is found in streams with moderate to fast flow, high oxygen levels, a depth greater than 0.6 m and temperatures between 10 and 24 degrees C.

O. peringueyi is sexually dimorphic with males growing at a faster rate and attaining a larger size than females. The breeding biology of this species was investigated in glass aquarium tanks. The spawning behaviour is described for the first time. The breeding colour of the male is deep red on the operculum, ventral part, caudal and ventral fins. The breeding colour in the female is the same as the male except the red colour is lighter. The breeding of O. peringueyi is a four stage process which begins with the appearance of breeding colour culminating in the laying of eggs after courtship. Temperature, flow-rate, conductivity and substrate were identified as the environmental cues important in the reproduction of this species. All these factors had a significant effect on the breeding activity of O. peringueyi. The possible effect of climate change on O. peringueyi is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Current distribution of the southern barred minnow, Opsaridium peringueyi (Pisces: Cyprinidae), in South Africa: Is there reason for concern?","['Venter, JA', 'Fouche, PSO', 'Vlok, W']",AFRICAN ZOOLOGY,10.3377/004.045.0203,OCT 2010,1,"In South Africa, relatively small, but healthy populations of Opsaridium peringueyi remain in the middle reaches of the Luvuvhu, Blyde, Sabie and Pongolo Rivers. The species may be extinct in some rivers like the Shingwedzi and lower-Olifants and its status is uncertain in the Crocodile and lower Komati/Mlumati Rivers. In many cases the rivers are transformed by the combined impact of alien species, dams and weirs, water abstraction, water regulation, pollution from industrial, agricultural, mining, forestry and urban areas as well as by sedimentation. These factors have caused the species distribution to become fragmented and have made it vulnerable to possible extinction. Because of the transformed nature of river systems in South Africa, the use of older historical data for biodiversity planning and conservation assessments might increase the risk of underrating conservation status and risks."
