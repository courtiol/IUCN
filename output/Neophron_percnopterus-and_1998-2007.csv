"Geographical variation in cloacal microflora and bacterial antibiotic resistance in a threatened avian scavenger in relation to diet and livestock farming practices (Retracted article. See vol. 14, pg. 3289, 2012)","['Blanco, G', 'Lemus, JA', 'Grande, J', 'Gangoso, L', 'Grande, JM', 'Donazar, JA', 'Arroyo, B', 'Frias, O', 'Hiraldo, F']",ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01291.x,JUL 2007,29,"The impact on wildlife health of the increase in the use of antimicrobial agents with the intensification of livestock production remains unknown. The composition, richness and prevalence of cloacal microflora as well as bacterial resistance to antibiotics in nestlings and full-grown Egyptian vultures Neophron percnopterus were assessed in four areas of Spain in which the degree of farming intensification differs. Differences in diet composition, especially the role of stabled livestock carrion, appear to govern the similarities of bacterial flora composition among continental populations, while the insular vulture population (Fuerteventura, Canary Islands) showed differences attributed to isolation. Evidence of a positive relationship between the consumption of stabled livestock carrion and bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics was found. Bacterial resistance was high for semisynthetic penicillins and enrofloxacin, especially in the area with the most intensive stabled livestock production. The pattern of antibiotic resistance was similar for the different bacterial species within each area. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics may be determined by resistance of bacteria present in the livestock meat remains that constituted the food of this species, as indicated by the fact that resistance to each antibiotic was correlated in Escherichia coli isolated from swine carrion and Egyptian vulture nestlings. In addition, resistance in normal faecal bacteria (present in the microflora of both livestock and vultures) was higher than in Staphylococcus epidermidis, a species indicator of the transient flora acquired presumably through the consumption of wild rabbits. Potential negative effects of the use of antimicrobials in livestock farming included the direct ingestion of these drug residues and the effects of bacterial antibiotic resistance on the health of scavengers."
Safety of meloxicam to critically endangered Gyps vultures and other scavenging birds in India,"['Swarup, D', 'Patra, RC', 'Prakash, V', 'Cuthbert, R', 'Das, D', 'Avari, P', 'Pain, DJ', 'Green, RE', 'Sharma, AK', 'Saini, M', 'Das, D', 'Taggart, M']",ANIMAL CONSERVATION,10.1111/j.1469-1795.2006.00086.x,MAY 2007,28,"Widespread veterinary use of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac is responsible for the population collapse of three species of Gyps vulture in south Asia; these species are now critically endangered. Vultures die when they consume carcasses of livestock that contain lethal residues of diclofenac. National and international conservation organizations have urgently recommended that diclofenac be banned and replaced with alternative drugs that are relatively safe to Gyps vultures and other scavenging birds. We tested the safety of the NSAID meloxicam on the oriental white-backed vulture, long-billed vulture and a range of other scavenging birds in India (Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, cattle egret Bubulcus ibis, house crow Corvus splendens, large-billed crow Corvus machrorhynchos and common mynah Acridotheres tristis). Meloxicam was administered by oral intubation [at 0.5 and 2.0 mg kg(-1) vulture body weight (bw)], or through feeding with muscle or liver tissue (at 0.3 to 2.1 mg kg(-1) vulture bw) from meloxicam-treated buffalo Bubalus bubalis. We estimate that 2.0 mg kg(-1) bw is the maximum likely exposure in the wild. All 31 Gyps vultures and the 20 other scavenging birds given meloxicam survived. Feeding behaviour remained normal and there were no significant differences between the treated and control groups in body mass, or the blood haematology and biochemistry parameters monitored, including those known to be affected by diclofenac (uric acid levels and alanine transferase activity). Meloxicam is used to treat a wide range of livestock ailments and is licensed and manufactured in India. We recommend that meloxicam be introduced as rapidly as possible across the Indian sub-continent as an alternative to diclofenac."
"Habitat, human pressure, and social behavior: Partialling out factors affecting large-scale territory extinction in an endangered vulture","['Carrete, M', 'Grande, JM', 'Tella, JL', 'Sanchez-Zapata, JA', 'Donazar, JA', 'Diaz-Delgadoa, R', 'Romo, A']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2006.11.025,APR 2007,58,"Extinctions are often the result of multiple factors that are difficult to disentangle and so methods for identifying simple and combined types of extinctions are valuable for both basic and applied ecology. We applied a modification of variance partitioning and a hierarchical partitioning analysis to test several hypotheses that attempt to explain the recent large-scale disappearance of Egyptian Vulture breeding territories in Spain. Our aim was to identify and then separate the simple (or pure) from the combined effects of habitat features, human pressure, and the social behavior of the species on the risk of extinction from a territory while controlling for spatial autocorrelation. Deviance partitioning showed that a complex mix of factors is significantly related to the disappearance of more than 400 territories throughout Spain. Abandoned territories were located in areas that are isolated from other conspecific territories and far from communal roost sites. In addition, these territories were found in places where there is a lack of natural habitats, high habitat fragmentation and reduced habitat diversity, and where food availability seems to be low and the illegal use of poison to control predators is a common practice. Deviance partitioning also showed an important spatial component in the probability of extinction. Abandoned territories were not randomly distributed; rather, they were aggregated in extinction 'hotspots', mainly related to food availability and human pressure. Deviance partitioning turned out to be an useful tool for identifying the relative contribution of a variety of factors - and their combined effects - associated with an extinction process. The deviance explained by each factor must be interpreted, however, in the context of a good knowledge of the life history of the species. Hierarchical partitioning can help rank conservation priorities and, by using as an objective criterion the relative weight of each independent variable that could be effectively managed for conservation, may provide wildlife managers with a means of saving funds and optimizing action plans.

Population size and breeding performance of Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) in eastern Iberian Peninsula,"['Garcia-Ripolles, C', 'Lopez-Lopez, P']",JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH,10.3356/0892-1016(2006)40[217:PSABPO]2.0.CO;2,SEP 2006,14,"The Iberian Peninsula, and primarily Spain, includes about 50% of the Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus) population in the western Palearctic. This endangered species has experienced a sharp decline in southern Europe since the end of the nineteenth century and has become extinct in most of its former distribution area. In this paper we report the Egyptian Vulture population trend between 1988-2005, and the number of breeding pairs and reproductive performance, 2003-2005, in Castellon province of eastern Spain. The number of breeding pairs increased from one pair in 1989 to 12 in 2005, probably due to the absence of poisoning and direct persecution in the Castellon province. From 2003-2005, we observed 34 breeding attempts at 23 different breeding sites. Mean chicks fledged per occupied territory was 0.91 +/- 0.08, mean chicks fledged per successful pair was 1.20 +/- 0.09, and mean breeding success was 0.76 +/- 0.07 successful pairs per breeding pair."

Rapid population declines of Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus) in India,"['Cuthbert, R', 'Green, RE', 'Ranade, S', 'Saravanan, S', 'Pain, DJ', 'Prakash, V', 'Cunningham, AA']",ANIMAL CONSERVATION,10.1111/j.1469-1795.2006.00041.x,AUG 2006,32,"Since the early 1990s, large and rapid population declines of three species of vulture (Gyps spp.) endemic to south Asia have occurred on the Indian subcontinent and have led to these species being listed by IUCN as critically endangered. Evidence of rates of population decline, cause of death and toxicity is consistent with these declines being caused by poisoning of vultures through the ingestion of tissues from livestock treated with the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac. In this paper, analysis of repeated surveys in and near protected areas widely spread across India shows that populations of two other vulture species, Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus and red-headed vulture Sarcogyps calvus, have also declined markedly and rapidly, but probably with a later onset than Gyps vultures in the same region. The declines continued at least up to 2003. It is recommended that these two species are considered for inclusion in the IUCN Red List and for urgent remedial conservation measures. Research is needed to determine whether or not the principal cause of these declines is diclofenac poisoning and to establish population trends in other scavenging birds in the Indian subcontinent."
"MtDNA genetic diversity and population history of a dwindling raptorial bird, the red kite (Milvus milvus)","['Roques, S', 'Negro, JJ']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2005.04.020,NOV 2005,27,"The red kite (Milvus milvus) occurs in a relatively small area in the southwestern Palearctic region, with population strongholds in Central Europe. Following strong human persecutions at the beginning of the 20th century, populations have receded, particularly in peripheral areas and islands. In order to describe and compare levels of genetic diversity and phylogeographic patterns throughout its entire distribution in Europe, sequence variation of a 357 bps part of the mitochondrial DNA control region was assessed in eight populations and 105 individuals. Overall, results indicate that population declines have affected red kite mtDNA variation. We found low levels of genetic diversity (values of nucleotide diversity ranging from 0 in Majorca island to 0.0062 in Central Europe), with only 10 distinct haplotypes, separated by low levels of genetic divergence (mean sequence divergence = 0.75%). Highest haplotype and nucleotide diversities match with demographic expectations, and were found in Central European and Central Spanish samples, where present strongholds occur, and lowest values in the declining southern Spanish and insular samples. Phi st estimates indicated moderate gene flow between populations. Phylogeographic patterns and mismatch distributions analyses suggest central European regions may have been colonized from southern glacial refugia (in the Italian or Iberian peninsulas). Interspecific phylogenetic comparisons and divergence date estimates indicated the genetic split between the red kite and its closely related species, the black kite (Milvus migrans), might be relatively recent. The low level of genetic variation found in the red kite mitochondrial control region, compared to the black kite, is likely the result of relatively recent divergence (associated with founder events), successive bottlenecks and small population sizes. As there are several ongoing projects aimed at reinforcing populations in countries such as the United Kingdom, Italy or Spain, our results may prove useful for the genetic management of the species.

Ground nesting by Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) in the Canary Islands,"['Gangoso, L', 'Palacios, CJ']",JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH,NA,JUN 2005,5,NA
Plasma B-esterase activities in European raptors,"['Roy, C', 'Grolleau, G', 'Chamoulaud, S', 'Riviere, JL']",JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES,NA,JAN 2005,21,"B-esterases are serine hydrolases composed of cholinesterases, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and carboxylesterase (CbE). These esterases, found in blood plasma, are inhibited by organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate (CB) insecticides and can be used as nondestructive biomarkers of exposure to anticholinesterase insecticides. Furthermore, B-esterases are involved in detoxification of these insecticides. In order to establish the level of these enzymes and to have reference values for their normal activities, total plasma cholinesterase (ChE), AChE and BChE activities, and plasma CbE activity were determined in 729 European raptors representing 20 species, four families, and two orders. The diurnal families of the Falconiforme order were represented by Accipitridae and Falconidae and the nocturnal families of the Strigiforme order by Tytonidae and Strigidae. Intraspecies differences in cholinesterase activities according to sex and/or age were investigated in buzzards (Buteo buteo), sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus), kestrels (Falco tinnunculus), barn owls (Tyto alba), and tawny owls (Strix aluco). Sex-related differences affecting ChE and AChE activities were observed in young kestrels (2-3-mo-old) and age-related differences in kestrels (ChE and AChE), sparrowhawks (AChE), and tawny owls (ChE, AChE, and BChE). The interspecies analysis yielded a negative correlation between ChE activity and body mass taking into account the relative contribution of AChE and BChE to ChE activity, with the exception of the honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus). The lowest ChE activities were found in the two largest species, Bonelli's eagle (Hieraaetus fasciatus) and Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) belonging to the Accipitridae family. The highest ChE activities were found in the relatively small species belonging to the Tytonidae and Strigidae families and in honey buzzard of the Accipitridae family. Species of the Accipitridae, Tytonidae, and Strigidae families were characterized by a BChE contribution that dominated the total ChE activity, while in the species of the Falconidae family, AChE activity dominated. With the exception of the barn owl, CbE activity (eserine-insensitive alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase [alpha-NAE] activity) in all species was almost absent or very low. The values obtained in this study for ChE, AChE, and BChE activities and the AChE:BChE ratios for buzzard, kestrel, barn owl, and tawny owl provide a good estimate of the normal values in free-living individuals of these European species. They can be used as a baseline to evaluate the effect of anticholinesterase insecticides in the field."
Migrations and sojourn in Africa of Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) tracked by satellite,"['Meyburg, BU', 'Gallardo, M', 'Meyburg, C', 'Dimitrova, E']",JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY,10.1007/s10336-004-0037-6,OCT 2004,28,"By means of satellite telemetry, the migrations of three young Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) from France and Bulgaria were studied and data obtained (over 4,300 Argos locations) to describe movement patterns, timing of migration, routes followed, speed of flight and ranging behaviour in Africa. Two French vultures migrated at almost the same time and, after travelling ca. 3,570 km, remained in the Sahelian zone, in southern Mauritania. The Bulgarian bird, after travelling 5,340 km, ended in south-east Chad, in the Sudano-Sahelian zone. It was possible to determine two remarkably long daily flight distances of this bird of over 500 km on two successive days (1,017 km in total) when crossing the Sahara. In January and February, the Bulgarian bird wandered extensively over 2,600 km, even as far as north-east Nigeria. Both French vultures remained in their home ranges in Mauritania once they had adopted them, which extended to 69,000 km(2) and 50,000 km(2)p, respectively. One continuously-tracked vulture from France first left its African home range when 3 years old (probably in its fourth plumage type)."
Current status and distribution of birds of prey in the Canary Islands,"['Palacios, CJ']",BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL,10.1017/S0959270904000255,SEP 2004,8,"I analyse recent trends in the status and distribution of breeding birds of prey in the Canary Islands (Spain). Populations of Barbary Falcon Falco peregrinus pelegrinoides, Eleonora's Falcon Falco eleonorae, Sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus granti, Buzzard Buteo buteo insularum and Osprey Pandion haliaetus recovered throughout the 1990s. Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus majorensis continues to be seriously threatened, with a total population of only around 130 birds. There is a lack of information on status of nocturnal birds of prey, especially of the Canary subspecies of Barn Owl Tyto alba gracilirostris, whose numbers seem to have decreased. Genetic studies should be carried out to clarify the taxonomic status of the birds of prey of the Canary Islands."
"Organization and variation of the mitochondrial control region in two vulture species, Gypaetus barbatus and Neophron percnopterus
","['Roques, S', 'Godoy, JA', 'Negro, JJ', 'Hiraldo, F']",JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,10.1093/jhered/esh047,JUL 2004,14,"We report the first entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences in two endangered vulture species, the bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) and the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus). Results showed that the general organization of vulture control regions was very similar to other birds, with three distinct domains: a left variable domain (DI), a central conserved one (DII) including the F, E, D, and C boxes, and a right domain (DIII) containing the CSB1 sequence. However, due to the presence of long tandem repeats, vulture control regions differed from other avian control regions both in size and nucleotide composition. The Egyptian vulture control region was found to be the largest sequenced so far (2031 bp), due to the simultaneous presence of repeats in both DI (80 bp) and DIII (77 bp). Low variation was found in vulture control regions, particularly in G. barbatus, as the probable result of populations declines in the last few centuries."
Molecular phylogeny and biogeography of Honey-buzzards (genera Pernis and Henicopernis),"['Gamauf, A', 'Haring, E']",JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH,10.1111/j.1439-0469.2004.00250.x,MAY 2004,16,"A partial sequence of the cytb gene (382 bp) was amplified and sequenced from 35 individuals (mainly museum specimens) of the genus Pernis representing all valid taxa (10) and two taxa (P. p. gurneyi, P. p. japonicus) with questionable validity as well as representatives of the Old World Perninae, namely Henicopernis and Aviceda, to assess their relationships to the genus Pernis. Furthermore, Gypaetus barbatus, Neophron percnopterus, and Buteo buteo were included as outgroup taxa. In the trees derived from the sequence data, Aviceda represents the sister group of the genus Pernis. The genus Henicopernis and the Old World vultures Gypaetus andNeophron appear rather distantly related to Pernis. Within the genus Pernis, two of the described species (Pernis apivorus, Pernis ptilorhyncus) form monophyletic groups, whereas the relationships of the two clades representing three subspecies of Pernis celebensis are still uncertain. Although this study is based on comparatively short DNA-sections, the trees deduced from these sequences can be considered as a first approach for inferring the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Pernis and related genera and for addressing questions concerning the evolutionary history, biogeography, and systematics of this group."

SigmaPCB concentrations were found to be in the range 3.2-97 ng/ml, while those of SigmaDDTs ranged from 0.93 to 38 ng/ml. p,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDE ratios higher than one were only found in the Segovia population, which could be an indication of recent use of p,p'-DDT in the area. In all cases, PCB profiles were dominated by congeners 52, 132 + 105, 138, 153 and 180. However, some differences among the five populations studied became evident when their profiles were compared with those of technical PCB mixtures by principal components analysis. The DDT and PCB levels detected in the serums analysed were lower than those previously reported for similar avian species and those reported to have deleterious effects on survival or reproduction of birds.

"Factors influencing the distribution, abundance and nest-site selection of an endangered Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) population in Sicily","['Sara, M', 'Di Vittori, M']",ANIMAL CONSERVATION,10.1017/S1367943003003391,NOV 2003,21,"The Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) breeds in Sicily and, in 22 years of monitoring, has shown a decline followed by a slight recovery. We used Generalised Linear Models to predict: (1) the distribution range, (2) the habitat selection within the range, (3) the quality (i.e., occupation rate, breeding success) of breeding sites. Some 60% of Sicily proved to be unsuitable, being either too densely forested and without cliffs for nesting, or too densely populated, along with intensive agriculture. The models converged, indicating that the pairs select a precise upland habitat where low cliffs, distant from urban areas, are surrounded by arboreal crops and Mediterranean vegetation. The variables predicting the quality of a site are also related to human disturbance, including the distance from a road or the presence of heavy traffic. Natural restocking, in the last 3 years, is occurring in quiet sites and in proximity to extensive grazing land rich in sheep and goat herds. These results focused on short-term programmes for local management of the species aimed at protracting the natural restocking: namely, the activation of (1) a stable system of artificial feeding stations, (2) nest site protection with joint activities for increasing public awareness, (3) a reintroduction project, by hacking, of juveniles born in captivity in Italian and European breeding centres."

Genetically distinct island populations of the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus),"['Kretzmann, MB', 'Capote, N', 'Gautschi, B', 'Godoy, JA', 'Donazar, JA', 'Negro, JJ']",CONSERVATION GENETICS,10.1023/B:COGE.0000006123.67128.86,2003,18,"The Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) is a species in decline throughout Europe, with the largest remaining breeding populations found in northern Spain. Iberian Peninsula populations of this species (about 1000 pairs) migrate to Africa in winter, while small populations in both the Canary and Balearic Islands (less than 40 pairs in each case) are apparently sedentary. We found that Egyptian vultures from both of these island groups were significantly differentiated from Iberian Peninsula populations (R-ST = 0.065-0.129, p = 0.000-0.007), using nine microsatellite loci isolated in a related species, the bearded vulture. The greatest degree of genetic differentiation was observed between the two island groups (R-ST = 0.279, p = 0.000). These island populations were more distinct from mainland groups than was a small sample of a well-defined separate subspecies from India (N. p. ginginianus; R-ST = 0.083-0.091, p = 0.023-0.024). This implies that these two island populations have been isolated from peninsular populations for many generations, despite the long-distance migration capabilities of the species. In constrast, populations within the Peninsula were not differentiated from one another at these microsatellite loci (R-ST = -0.004-0.007, p = 0.442-0.675). Introductions of Egyptian vultures from the larger northern breeding groups might therefore be appropriate in southern Spain, if necessary, but mainland birds should not be introduced to the islands if the genetic distinctiveness of these groups is to be preserved. Independent conservation plans are urgently required to protect these two island populations from extinction."

In the Canary archipelago, the species only survives in the islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. During 1998-2001 we examined population parameters and evaluated some potential limiting factors for this isolated and sedentary population. The total population (breeding and non-breeding birds) was monitored annually. In addition, 26 fledglings and 33 immatures (< 6 years old) and adult birds were captured for individual marking with plastic rings. Twenty-three/twenty-four occupied territories were located in the island and the total population estimated at around 130 birds. Breeding success was lower than recorded elsewhere in the species' distribution area: only 0.43 fledglings/pair/year were produced. Adult (> 6 years old birds) and immature annual survival rates were similar, around 90%. Adult Survival was lower than expected as territorial birds seem more susceptible to poisoning. Immature survival could be favoured by the existence of regular feeding places. Casualties from power lines was the main cause of mortality (12 cases during the study period). Blood sampling revealed high frequencies of lead poisoning: 13.5 and 2.7% of individuals showed sub-clinical and clinical intoxication levels, respectively, probably caused by the ingestion of lead shot. Priority conservation measures should be directed to reduce electrocution risks, illegal poisoning, arid lead contamination. Population reinforcement with birds coining from other populations is not recommended as previous information reveals morphological and genetic differentiation of Canarian Egyptian vultures compared with continental populations.

We provided food to Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) in the Negev Desert, Israel, under 2 regimes. A regular feeding station (RFS) was stocked daily with 5-10 kg of chicken carcasses, and an irregular feeding station (IFS) was stocked approximately twice monthly with 20-350 kg of livestock carcasses. At the RFS, numbers peaked at 20-30 birds; flock size at the IFS peaked at 30-40 birds. Adults feeding on chickens could dominate individual carcasses and fed in higher proportions than younger birds. Large carcasses and scattered scraps at the IFS could not be defended by individuals, and adults did not feed preferentially Small, daily food deliveries favored adults and resulted in higher proportions of flocks feeding. Large, infrequent deliveries did not favor any age class; however, infrequent food deliveries may not provide sufficiently regular food for adults feeding young. Smaller competing scavengers at the RFS did not exclude Egyptian vultures from food. At the IFS, large mammals briefly excluded vultures but often improved access to food by tearing open carcasses. Eurasian griffons (Gyps fulvus) at the IFS excluded Egyptian vultures and consumed most of the available food. Eurasian griffons did not feed. on chicken carcasses; hence, small carcasses can be used to feed small vulture species preferentially when species that specialize on large carcasses are also present."
Effects of age and captivity on plasma chemistry values of the Egyptian Vulture,"['Dobado-Berrios, PM', 'Tella, JL', 'Ceballos, O', 'Donazar, JA']",CONDOR,10.2307/1369754,NOV 1998,33,"Despite the interest in blood chemistry for studying ecological and pathological characteristics of birds, sources of variability such as age and captivity are poorly understood, and reference values usually are obtained from adult captive birds. We determined 15 plasma chemical variables for 164 free-living Egyptian Vultures (Neophron percnopterus) of three age groups (nestlings, subadults, and adults), and for 9 captive adults. Free-living subadults and adults exhibited identical plasma chemistry values. Nestlings had significantly higher levels of creatinine, urate, urea, triglycerides, calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase (AP) than both free-living subadults and adults, but lower values of glucose and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Captive adults had significantly higher levels of total protein, albumin, creatinine, urate, cholesterol, calcium, phosphorus, and AST than free-living adults, which we attribute to differences in diet quality and physical activity. We conclude that future studies should consider age as a major source of variability in avian plasma chemistry, and that results obtained from captivity should be used cautiously to interpret plasma chemistry in the study and rehabilitation of wild birds."
