"Metabolic rates of three gazelle species (Nanger soemmerringii, Gazella gazella, Gazella spekei) adapted to arid habitats","['Dittmann, MT', 'Hebel, C', 'Arif, A', 'Kreuzer, M', 'Clauss, M']",MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.mambio.2015.05.008,SEP 2015,0,"The basal metabolic rate of mammals correlates with body mass, but deviations from this regression have been observed and explanations comprise ecological adaptations, reproductive strategies or phylogeny. Certain mammalian groups, adapted to arid environments, show comparatively lower metabolic rates. To expand existing datasets and to investigate metabolic rates in ruminants adapted to arid environments, we conducted respiration measurements with three gazelle species (Gazella spekei, G. gazella and N. soemmerringii, total n = 16). After an adaptation period to a diet of fresh lucerne offered ad libitum, subjects were put separately into respiration boxes for 24 h where they had free access to food and water. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were measured with a modular system of gas analyzers and pumps. Mean and resting metabolic rate (RMR) were calculated by accounting for the entire measurement phase or the lowest 20 oxygen measurements, respectively. N. soemmerringii had the lowest relative RMR values and the highest respiratory coefficients compared to the other species. Measured values were compared to expected RMR values calculated based on body mass. Gazella spekei and G. gazella showed higher RMR values than expected, while the RMR of N. soemmerringii was in the range of expected values. Our results indicate that not all mammals adapted to aridity have lower metabolic rates under conditions of unlimited resources and that in these cases other physiological adaptations might be of higher importance. Further extensions of the datasets could allow explaining which deviations of metabolic rate from the body mass regressions result from convergent adaptations.

Digesta kinetics in gazelles in comparison to other ruminants: Evidence for taxon-specific rumen fluid throughput to adjust digesta washing to the natural diet,"['Dittmann, MT', 'Hummel, J', 'Hammer, S', 'Arif, A', 'Hebel, C', 'Muller, DWH', 'Fritz, J', 'Steuer, P', 'Schwarm, A', 'Kreuzer, M', 'Clauss, M']",COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cbpa.2015.01.013,JUL 2015,3,"Digesta flow plays an important role in ruminant digestive physiology. We measured the mean retention time (MRT) of a solute and a particle marker in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the reticulorumen (RR) of five gazelles and one dikdik species. Species-specific differences were independent from body mass (BM) or food intake. Comparative evaluations (including up to 31 other ruminant species) indicate that MRT GIT relate positively to BM, and are less related to feeding type (the percentage of grass in the natural diet, %grass) than MRT RR. The MRTparticleRR is related to BM and (as a trend) %grass, matching a higher RR capacity with increasing BM in grazers compared to browsers. MRTsoluteRR is neither linked to BM nor to %grass but shows a consistent phylogenetic signal. Selectivity factors (SF; MRTparticle/MRTsolute, proxies for the degree of digesta washing) are positively related to %grass, with a threshold effect, where species with >20% grass have higher SF. These findings suggest that in different ruminant taxa, morphophysiological adaptations controlling MRTsoluteRR evolved to achieve a similar SF RR in relation to a %grass threshold. A high SF could facilitate an increased microbial yield from the forestomach. Reasons for variation in SF above the %grass threshold might represent important drivers of ruminant diversification and await closer investigation. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc."
