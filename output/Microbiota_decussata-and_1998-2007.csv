"Total synthesis of (+/-)-beta-microbiotene, (+/-)-microbiotol, (+/-)-cyclocuparanol and (+/-)-beta-cuparenones","['Srikrishna, A', 'Ramachary, DB']",INDIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY SECTION B-ORGANIC CHEMISTRY INCLUDING MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY,NA,MAY 2007,2,"Total synthesis of (+/-)-beta-microbiotene, (+/-)-microbiotol, (+/-)-cyclocuparanol and their epirners along with (+/-)-beta-cuparenone has been described. A combination of orthoester Claisen rearrangement, an acid catalysed rearrangement of a diazoketone for the generation of bicyclo[4.2.1]nonanedione, a retro-Claisen condensation and an intramolecular diazoketone cyclopropanation reaction have been employed for the construction of three contiguous quaternary atoms present in cyclocuparanes."

"The chemical composition of Microbiota decussata
","['Krauze-Baranowska, M', 'Mardarowicz, M', 'Wiwart, M']",ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG C-A JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES,NA,NOV-DEC 2002,13,"From the leaves of Microbiota decussata (Cupressaceae) biflavones: cupressuflavone, amentoflavone and 7-O-methylamentoflavone were isolated and identified. The amount of cupressuflavone in Microbiota decussata and xCupressocyparis leylandii (Leyland cypress) (Cupressaceae) was determined by HPLC (1.82% and 0.83%, respectively). The chemical composition of essential oils from bark and leaves of Microbiota decussata was established by GC-MS (GC-FID) analysis. As a major component thujopsene (39.2% and 45.9%, respectively) was identified. Wiridiflorol (3.0%) and tau-muurolol (0.3%) were present only in leaves but globulol (1.5%) exclusively in bark. The content of essential oils in M. decussata was high -5.4% in bark and 12.6% in leaves. The essential oils from M. decussata and xC. leylandii were bioassayed towards different fungi of the genus Fusarium. Leyland cypress essential oil at 2% concentration fully inhibited the growth of all fungi."
Natural occurrence of alpha- and beta-microbiotene,"['Melching, S', 'Blume, A', 'Konig, WA', 'Muhle, H']",PHYTOCHEMISTRY,10.1016/S0031-9422(98)00152-6,JUN 1998,13,"(-)-alpha-Microbiotene {(-)-(1S,5S)-2-methyl-5[(1S)-1,2,2-trimemethylcyclopentyl]-bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-ene} (+)-beta-microbiotene {(+)-(1S,2S)-2-methyl-5[(1S)-1,2,2-tri-methyl-cyclopentyl]-bicyclo[3.1.0.]hex-2(7)-ene} and (-)-cyclocupar-9-en-2-one have been isolated and identified from the essential oil of the liverwort Mannia fragrans and correlated with constituents of opposite configuration from Microbiota decussata (Cupressaceae).

Phylogenetic age and relationship between Far East conifers as revealed by the comparison of their seed proteins,"['Orekhova, TP']",RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY,NA,MAY-JUN 1998,0,"The protein complex in the seeds of eight species of Far East conifers (Pinaceae, Taxaceae, and Cupressaceae) was studied to estimate their phylogenetic age and relationship. Total protein content and the ratio between readily (RSP), moderately (MSP), and hardly (HSP) soluble proteins in the seeds were used as a criterion for phylogenetic advancement. Protein content in seeds varied from 10% of dry wt in Pinus koraiensis to 34% in Taxus cuspidata. Seeds of Pinus densiflora contained the greatest fraction of HSP (87%), which might indicate the ancient origin of this species; seeds of Abies holophilla had the greatest fraction of RSP (74%), which characterizes this species as the youngest. Relict bradytelic conifers (Taxus cuspidata, Microbiota decussata, and Pinus koraiensis) had a specific protein composition, which does not reflect their phylogenetic age. The narrow protein spectrum in Taxus cuspidata and Microbiota decussata might indicate their ancient origin. Common proteins in the seeds of Taxus cuspidata and other Pinaceae seem to indicate their relationship. Protein components found in the seeds of all the Pinaceae studied probably represent the phylogonetically old proteins typical of this family. It is concluded that the pattern and amount of protein in the seeds of Far East conifers are appropriate biochemical indicators of the relative phylogenetic age of particular genera. Relict species require additional morphological, anatomical, and biochemical criteria."
