"Distribution and genetic diversity of the Endangered Abbott's duiker Cephalophus spadix in the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania","['Bowkett, AE', 'Jones, T', 'Rovero, F', 'Nielsen, MR', 'Davenport, TRB', 'Hawkins, DM', 'Plowman, AB', 'Stevens, JR']",ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH,10.3354/esr00587,2014,0,"Abbott's duiker Cephalophus spadix is a forest antelope endemic to a very few highland forests in Tanzania. Apparently extinct over much of its historical range, the species is listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature based on its rarity and its known current distribution in only 5 isolated upland areas: Kilimanjaro, Southern Highlands, West Usambara, Rubeho and Udzungwa Mountains. In contrast to the situation in the rest of its range, Abbott's duiker is relatively well documented and locally abundant in parts of the Udzungwa Mountains, which may now be the only stronghold for the species. We review the distribution of Abbott's duiker within the Udzungwa Mountains and present new information based on the non-invasive genetic identification of dung piles collected from the majority of forest blocks between 2006 and 2010 ( 73 confirmed dung samples). Our results include new records from outlying forest blocks where the presence of Abbott's duiker was previously unknown. Moreover, we present the first population-level analysis of genetic structure and diversity in this endangered species based on nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial sequence data. While these genetic results are limited due to small sample sizes, they indicate differentiation from other Abbott's duiker populations, as well as low genetic diversity relative to sympatric antelope species. Finally, we discuss threats to Abbott's duiker and identify broad trends within the differently managed Udzungwa Mountain forests, and elsewhere, that suggest potentially successful conservation strategies for this neglected species."
Can molecular data validate morphometric identification of faecal pellets in Tanzanian forest antelope species?,"['Bowkett, AE', 'Jones, T', 'Laizzer, RL', 'Plowman, AB', 'Stevens, JR']",CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES,10.1007/s12686-013-9935-3,DEC 2013,4,"Forest-dwelling antelope species are often difficult to detect during surveys due to their cryptic behaviour and densely vegetated habitats. Dung counts have traditionally been used to infer forest antelope abundance but genetic identification has shown that visual identification of ungulate dung to species is often unreliable. This study attempted to use easily obtained morphometric data from faecal pellets to statistically assign antelope dung piles to species. We measured pellets from 238 dung piles collected from the Udzungwa Mountains, south-central Tanzania, a largely forested landscape with five forest-associated antelope species including the endangered Abbott's duiker Cephalophus spadix. The species identity of sampled dung piles was determined by amplifying a c. 600 bp fragment of the mitochondrial control region and aligning DNA sequences with published references. We found no diagnostic differences in faecal pellet size between antelope species although there were significant differences in mean pellet length and width. We employed a single variable linear discriminant analysis to predict the species of dung piles based on pellet length. Despite significant differentiation between species we obtained an overall accuracy of 58.8 % that did not meet our specified probability threshold (P < 0.05). Abbott's duiker dung piles were correctly assigned in the majority of cases (74 %). Overall, morphometric assignment of dung piles to species was not accurate enough to validate dung counts as a survey method for forest antelope although our results do not preclude the development of alternative field identification methods using additional non-molecular characters."
