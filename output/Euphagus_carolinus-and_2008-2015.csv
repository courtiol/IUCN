"Habitat selection, nest survival, and nest predators of Rusty Blackbirds in northern New England, USA","['Luepold, SHB', 'Hodgman, TP', 'McNulty, SA', 'Cohen, J', 'Foss, CR']",CONDOR,10.1650/CONDOR-14-215.1,NOV 2015,0,"Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) populations have plummeted since the mid-20th century. Recent research in New England, USA, suggests that an ecological trap, created through timber harvesting on the breeding grounds, may be responsible. Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were hypothesized to be the primary nest predator, but definitive identification was lacking. The potential for mast cone crops to affect Rusty Blackbird nest predation via trophic interactions also remains unexamined. Our objectives were to identify the mechanisms by which an ecological trap may be operating in New England through a multiscale analysis of Rusty Blackbird habitat selection and nest survival, as well as predator identification and quantification. We located 72 Rusty Blackbird nests in Maine and New Hampshire in 2011 and 2012, and modeled habitat selection and nest survival as a function of habitat characteristics at the nest patch (5 m) and home range (500 m) scale. We placed camera traps at 29 nests to identify nest predators, and conducted ground surveys to obtain an index of squirrel abundance each year. We found that Rusty Blackbirds selected nest patches with a high basal area of small conifers and low canopy closure. Nest survival was not reduced in harvested stands, but increased with increasing basal area. Percent cover of wetlands and young softwood stands were the best predictors of Rusty Blackbird selection at the home range scale. At the home range scale, we found that nests that were closer to a road were less successful in 2011, but not in 2012. Red squirrels were the most frequent predator of Rusty Blackbird nests in 2012, when they were abundant following a mast year in 2011. These results suggest that dense cover of small softwoods is important for habitat selection and survival of Rusty Blackbird nests, and that precommercial thinning and possibly road-building could reduce habitat quality for this species."
Competition and Habitat Quality Influence Age and Sex Distribution in Wintering Rusty Blackbirds,"['Mettke-Hofmann, C', 'Hamel, PB', 'Hofmann, G', 'Zenzal, TJ', 'Pellegrini, A', 'Malpass, J', 'Garfinkel, M', 'Schiff, N', 'Greenberg, R']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0123775,MAY 6 2015,1,"Bird habitat quality is often inferred from species abundance measures during the breeding and non-breeding season and used for conservation management decisions. However, during the non-breeding season age and sex classes often occupy different habitats which suggest a need for more habitat-specific data. Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) is a forested wetland specialist wintering in bottomland hardwood forests in the south-eastern U.S. and belongs to the most steeply declining songbirds in the U.S. Little information is available to support priority birds such as the Rusty Blackbird wintering in this threatened habitat. We assessed age and sex distribution and body condition of Rusty Blackbirds among the three major habitats used by this species in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley and also measured food availability. Overall, pecan groves had the highest biomass mainly driven by the amount of nuts. Invertebrate biomass was highest in forests but contributed only a small percentage to overall biomass. Age and sex classes were unevenly distributed among habitats with adult males primarily occupying pecan groves containing the highest nut biomass, females being found in forests which had the lowest nut biomass and young males primarily staying in forest fragments along creeks which had intermediate nut biomass. Males were in better body condition than females and were in slightly better condition in pecan groves. The results suggest that adult males occupy the highest quality habitat and may competitively exclude the other age and sex classes."
"Habitat occupancy of Rusty Blackbirds (Euphagus carolinus) breeding in northern New England, USA","['Powell, LL', 'Hodgman, TP', 'Fiske, IJ', 'Glanz, WE']",CONDOR,10.1650/CONDOR-13-033-R1.1,FEB 2014,0,"The Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus), an uncommon songbird often associated with northern coniferous wetlands, has experienced a precipitous population decline since at least the early 20th century. Here, we provide the first analysis of breeding-habitat occupancy at the wetland scale and make recommendations for streamlined monitoring. We modeled occupancy and detectability as a function of site (i.e. habitat-based) and sampling (i.e. visit-specific) variables collected at 546 wetlands in northern New England, USA. Wetland occupancy (mean +/- SE = 0.07 +/- 0.02 in randomly selected wetlands, and 0.12 +/- 0.02 in all wetlands surveyed) was best explained by variables describing Rusty Blackbird foraging habitat (PUDDLES: a proxy for shallow water), nesting habitat (coniferous adjacent uplands), and evidence of beavers. In contrast to Rusty Blackbirds' selection of pole-stage conifers at the nest-site scale, stand age did not affect occupancy at the wetland scale. It appears that most wetlands in northern coniferous forest landscapes, regardless of stand age, offer dense conifer patches nearby and provide suitable breeding habitat if quality foraging sites (e.g., areas of shallow water) also are available. Detectability (0.29 +/- 0.04) decreased with increasing wind speed, and decreased about fourfold over the course of the breeding season. Rusty Blackbirds responded to broadcast of conspecific vocalizations by flying toward the observer and perching more often than prior to broadcast, demonstrating that broadcasts can be a useful tool to enhance visual detectability. Given our results, observers can now focus site selection on wetlands and sampling conditions most likely to maximize detections of Rusty Blackbirds."
IDENTIFYING MIGRATORY PATHWAYS USED BY RUSTY BLACKBIRDS BREEDING IN SOUTHCENTRAL ALASKA,"['Johnson, JA', 'Matsuoka, SM', 'Tessler, DF', 'Greenberg, R', 'Fox, JW']",WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY,NA,DEC 2012,1,"We placed light-level geolocators on 17 Rusty Blackbirds (Euphagus carolinus) in 2009 to track their migrations from nest sites near Anchorage, Alaska to wintering areas and back. We recaptured three of these birds in 2010 and found they departed breeding areas during the first half of September, spent 72-84 days migrating to overwintering areas, but only 16-30 days on their northward migration to Alaska. Birds took similar Central Flyway routes on southward and northward migrations, which were not previously described for this species. The birds used a series of stopover sites across the prairie region from southern Saskatchewan to Iowa over a 4 to 5 week period on their southward migration to wintering areas that spanned from South Dakota to northern Louisiana. We found upon recapture in 2010, the geolocator attachment harnesses had abraded the surrounding feathers on all three birds. This coupled with the low return rate (18%) for instrumented birds indicates a better harness method must be developed before this technology is more widely used on Rusty Blackbirds.

Climate change and the decline of a once common bird,"['McClure, CJW', 'Rolek, BW', 'McDonald, K', 'Hill, GE']",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1002/ece3.95,FEB 2012,5,"Climate change is predicted to negatively impact wildlife through a variety of mechanisms including retraction of range. We used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey and regional and global climate indices to examine the effects of climate change on the breeding distribution of the Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus), a formerly common species that is rapidly declining. We found that the range of the Rusty Blackbird retracted northward by 143 km since the 1960s and that the probability of local extinction was highest at the southern range margin. Furthermore, we found that the mean breeding latitude of the Rusty Blackbird was significant and positively correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation with a lag of six years. Because the annual distribution of the Rusty Blackbird is affected by annual weather patterns produced by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, our results support the hypothesis that directional climate change over the past 40 years is contributing to the decline of the Rusty Blackbird. Our study is the first to implicate climate change, acting through range retraction, in a major decline of a formerly common bird species."
Exploratory analysis of correlates of the abundance of rusty blackbirds (Euphagus carolinus) during fall migration,"['Savard, JPL', 'Cousineau, M', 'Drolet, B']",ECOSCIENCE,10.2980/18-4-3401,2011,3,"The rusty blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) has received much attention during the last decade, in part due to drastic population declines. We analyzed data from 15 y of fall migration monitoring at the Observatoire d'oiseaux de Tadoussac (OOT), located at the mouth of the Saguenay River on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River estuary in Quebec, Canada. The trend observed suggest an ongoing decline. Numbers of rusty blackbirds varied considerably between years, with peak movements occurring at 5-y intervals and possibly reflecting high reproductive success for those years. The numbers of adult boreal owls caught and banded at the OOT, and the proportion of juveniles, were negatively and positively correlated with rusty blackbird numbers, respectively. Peaks in rusty blackbird abundance occurred when red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi) were abundant in the eastern boreal forest. Also, rusty blackbird numbers were positively correlated to the annual and winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices and negatively to the combined precipitation for June, July, and August, suggesting that environmental factors may have contributed both directly and indirectly (through food web processes) to the cyclic variations in abundance observed. Current declines may be exacerbated by NAO fluctuation patterns, that is, more frequent negative indices may negatively affect reproductive success and possibly winter survival."
SPECIAL SECTION: RANGEWIDE ECOLOGY OF THE DECLINING RUSTY BLACKBIRD RUSTY BLACKBIRD: MYSTERIES OF A SPECIES IN DECLINE,"['Greenberg, R', 'Matsuoka, SM']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100153,NOV 2010,11,"The Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) breeds across the boreal forest zone of North America and winters throughout the eastern United States. Over the past four decades, the North American Breeding Bird Survey and the Christmas Bird Count have shown high rates of population decline ranging from approximately 5 to 12% per year. Regional surveys suggest declines and range retractions in the southern boreal zone. Analyses of historical accounts suggest that the Rusty Blackbird's abundance has been dropping steadily for over a century. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the decline. The species relies on wooded wetlands throughout the year, so loss and degradation of these habitats-particularly in the winter range-is a prime suspect. Blackbird-control programs may have contributed. In recent decades, habitat disturbance, global warming, and environmental contamination in the boreal zone may have taken their toll on breeding populations. In 2005, the International Rusty Blackbird Working Group was formed to develop research efforts toward understanding the mysterious decline. This special section presents the group's research findings-the first on the species' use of breeding and winter habitat, reproductive success, parasite prevalence, patterns of molt, and migratory connectivity. Data on the levels of methylmercury in tissues and the role of timber management on reproductive success are intriguing. We outline research needed for assessment of the roles of various factors in causing the decline of the Rusty Blackbird."
MIGRATORY CONNECTIVITY IN THE RUSTY BLACKBIRD: ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE FROM FEATHERS OF HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY SPECIMENS,"['Hobson, KA', 'Greenberg, R', 'Van Wilgenburg, SL', 'Mettke-Hofmann, C']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100146,NOV 2010,15,"The Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) has declined dramatically across its range in North America since at least the 1960s, but the causes for this decline are unknown. We measured ratios of stable hydrogen isotopes (delta D) in feathers collected from Rusty Blackbirds wintering in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (n = 255 birds) and the coastal plain of South Carolina and Virginia (n = 281 birds), 2005-2009, to estimate the region of origin of birds wintering west and east of the Appalachians, respectively. We also measured delta D values in feathers from all available museum specimens collected from 1879 to 1990 in these same two regions (n = 190 birds). Isotopic values support migratory connectivity in this species with breeding populations in the western and central boreal forest migrating through a central or Mississippi flyway and those breeding in the eastern boreal forest migrating to a winter range east of the Appalachians. We detected little long-term change in the breeding origins of modern and historical populations wintering east and west of the Appalachians. However, we found short-term temporal variability in the breeding origins of birds wintering on the coastal plain from 2007 to 2009. The migratory divide suggests that efforts at management should be tailored to at least eastern and western subpopulations on both the breeding and wintering grounds. Our approach can be applied to a broad range of migratory species in North America and on other continents."
NEST-SITE SELECTION AND NEST SURVIVAL OF THE RUSTY BLACKBIRD: DOES TIMBER MANAGEMENT ADJACENT TO WETLANDS CREATE ECOLOGICAL TRAPS?,"['Powell, LL', 'Hodgman, TP', 'Glanz, WE', 'Osenton, JD', 'Fisher, CM']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100152,NOV 2010,15,"Animals are subject to ecological traps when anthropogenic changes create habitat that appears suitable but when selected results in decreased fitness. The Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) breeds in boreal wetlands and has declined by 85-95% over the last half century. We studied nest-site selection and daily nest-survival rate (DSR) of 43 Rusty Blackbird nests in northern New England and evaluated whether regenerating logged areas adjacent to wetlands created ecological traps. Although nesting adults avoided high-canopied forests and selected areas with dense balsam fir (Abies balasmea) I to 3 m high, those characteristics were not associated with DSR. Conversely, the frequency of speckled alder (Alnus incana) and sedges (Cyperaceae) in the nest plot varied with DSR, suggesting that the risk of predation of nests within wetlands was lower. DSR also varied with past logging; nests in plots not harvested recently were 2.3x more likely to fledge young than nests in plots harvested within 20 years. When logging extends to the edges of or into wetlands, the subsequent dense regenerating conifers appear to attract Rusty Blackbirds to nest closer to or within these human-altered uplands, exposing their nests to increased predation not typical of unaltered wetlands. Three surrogates for habitat preference did not differ by timber-management history, suggesting that the birds do not prefer habitats that increase their fitness. Rusty Blackbirds nesting in harvested wetlands may be subject to ""equal preference"" ecological traps, and we suggest that buffers 75 m wide around the perimeter of suitable wetlands should increase DSR."
NESTING ECOLOGY OF THE RUSTY BLACKBIRD IN ALASKA AND CANADA,"['Matsuoka, SM', 'Shaw, D', 'Sinclair, PH', 'Johnson, JA', 'Corcoran, RM', 'Dau, NC', 'Meyers, PM', 'Rojek, NA']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100149,NOV 2010,8,"We examined the nesting ecology of the Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) from 162 nests monitored for nest survival in Alaska and 252 incidental records from Alaska and Canada to identify important habitats for nesting and to test whether low rates of nest success are contributing to populations declines in Alaska. In coastal Alaska and throughout Canada, nests were primarily in conifers (85% of 212 nests). All conifer nests in Alaska and 80% of those in Canada were placed in spruce (Picea spp.), primarily black spruce (P. mariana). In Alaska use of small spruces (<8 cm dbh) was selective and resulted in high reproductive success-nest survival increased with black spruce density, and success of nests in spruce (79%) was higher than that of nests in deciduous vegetation (52%). Survival of nests in taller spruce declined, possibly from predation by red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). Rusty Blackbirds nested near water in interior (<(x)over bar> = 8 m) and south-central Alaska ((x) over bar = 30 m), and small spruces near water appear to be important over much of the species' range. In interior Alaska, however, most nests were in willows (78%), which dominated the vegetation near water. Nest success in Alaska averaged 56%, similar to rates over the same period in New England but higher than those of other North American blackbirds (30-39%). Studies are needed to verify whether nest survival is also high in Canada and to investigate where and why deficits in survival of adults or juveniles may be limiting population growth."
ESTIMATING THE ABUNDANCE OF NESTING RUSTY BLACKBIRDS IN RELATION TO WETLAND HABITATS IN ALASKA,"['Matsuoka, SM', 'Shaw, D', 'Johnson, JA']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100148,NOV 2010,5,"We used double sampling to estimate densities of Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) nests among boreal wetlands in Anchorage and Tanana Flats, Alaska, 2007-2008. We also assessed habitat selection by examining the number and location of nests relative to the availability of various wetland types. We rapidly surveyed 78 sample units for adult Rusty Blackbirds and intensively searched for nests in a subset of 55 units to determine actual numbers of nests. Rapid surveys detected 97% of the 75 nests when we restricted counts to pairs and lone females. They overestimated nest numbers by 17% when we included in the counts lone males, which sometimes made long flights within and between sample units. Nest densities in sampled wetlands averaged 2.2 and 3.4 nests km(-2) in Anchorage and Tanana Flats, respectively, surprisingly similar despite wetlands being rare in Anchorage. An abundance of wetlands made identifying important breeding habitats difficult on the Tanana Flats, where blackbirds used most wetland types in relation to their availability and avoided wetlands with low shrubs. Habitat selection was clearer in Anchorage, where ponds, lakes, and wetlands with emergent vegetation were positive predictors of nest abundance. In this area blackbirds also selected forested wetlands and avoided upland habitats for nest sites. An affinity for open water has been noted throughout the Rusty Blackbird's breeding range. Research is needed to understand whether this affinity is due to specialized food requirements and to assess whether this species is vulnerable to widespread drying of wetlands across boreal Alaska."
HOME RANGES OF RUSTY BLACKBIRDS BREEDING IN WETLANDS: HOW MUCH WOULD BUFFERS FROM TIMBER HARVEST PROTECT HABITAT?,"['Powell, LL', 'Hodgman, TP', 'Glanz, WE']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100151,NOV 2010,5,"We calculated the home ranges and core areas of 13 adult Rusty Blackbirds (Euphagus carolinus) in Maine to determine (1) the area requirements of breeding adults, (2) whether area requirements of the sexes and of colonial and noncolonial individuals differ, and (3) the proportion of the home range and core area that would be protected by a buffer of no logging of 50-100 m around occupied wetlands. Mean home ranges (37.5 +/- 12.6 ha) and core areas (11.1 +/- 2.8 ha) were large in comparison to those of other breeding icterids, and adults often foraged in multiple unconnected wetlands. Rusty Blackbirds that were part of a loose colony had home ranges and core areas three times larger than those of pairs that nested solitarily, which we speculate may be due to adults following one other to feed on unpredictable emergences of aquatic insects. Home ranges and core areas included a surprisingly small amount of wetland habitat, only 12% and 19% respectively, but adults often foraged in small wet patches (<16 m(2)) in otherwise upland habitat. The 75-m buffers around wetlands that we recommended in a concurrent study may help protect the Rusty Blackbird's nesting habitat, but such buffers contained less than half the average home range, suggesting that they may be of only limited benefit as a conservation strategy for protecting foraging habitat."
HABITAT OCCUPANCY BY RUSTY BLACKBIRDS WINTERING IN THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI ALLUVIAL VALLEY,"['Luscier, JD', 'Lehnen, SE', 'Smith, KG']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100147,NOV 2010,6,"The Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) has declined by 90% since the 1960s, possibly from conversions of forested wetlands in the southeastern U.S. to agriculture. Because its habitat use during the nonbreeding season had not been quantified, we estimated occupancy rates of Rusty Blackbirds wintering in the lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley in relation to habitat type (four types of bottomland forest and adjacent agricultural fields), tree density, canopy cover, and water cover. In January and February, we surveyed 89 sites eight times during 2006, 117 and 109 sites 10 times during 2007 and 2008, respectively. Occupancy of individual birds, estimated from their presence or absence at a site, was generally high and greater in 2006 (0.71) than during either 2007 (0.43) or 2008 (0.37). Occupancy of flocks, estimated from presence or absence of >= 20 individuals, was highest in 2006 (0.46), lowest in 2007 (0.17), and intermediate in 2008 (0.30), possibly because of water levels fluctuating from year to year. Rusty Blackbirds were not as specialized in habitat use as expected; habitat characteristics did not consistently predict occupancy of either individuals or flocks. Occupancy of individuals increased with canopy cover during 2007, and occupancy of flocks decreased with tree density during 2006. In 2008, occupancy of individuals increased with tree density and was higher in wet bottomland forest (0.51) than in other habitats (0.31-0.35). Further research is needed to determine whether this lack of habitat specificity is widespread and possibly the result of diverse food requirements during the nonbreeding season."
IMPLICATIONS OF PREBASIC AND A PREVIOUSLY UNDESCRIBED PREALTERNATE MOLT FOR AGING RUSTY BLACKBIRDS,"['Mettke-Hofmann, C', 'Sinclair, PH', 'Hamel, PB', 'Greenberg, R']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100150,NOV 2010,4,"Aging birds often relies on differences in plumage between immatures and adults, and understanding these patterns can improve our ability to discern demographic patterns within populations. We investigated patterns of prebasic molt of the Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) in fall at Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, and developed a new technique for aging based on characteristics of the head plumage acquired during prebasic molt. Furthermore, we investigated the possibility of a prealternate molt among wintering Rusty Blackbirds on the basis of captures in Mississippi and museum specimens from across the species' winter range. Finally, we examined how a prealternate molt might affect the aging of winter birds by plumage. Rusty Blackbirds completed their prebasic molt by the end of September, and immature birds had a more prominent eye ring and a paler chin than adults, allowing a reliable age determination. Previously, the Rusty Blackbird was thought to attain its breeding plumage through feather wear exclusively, but we discovered a partial prealternate molt in our examinations of live captures (76% molting) and museum specimens (59% molting). The prealternate molt was observed in all age and sex classes, was concentrated along the feather tracts of the head, and peaked in occurrence from mid-February to mid-March, when nearly 90% of birds were molting. Between mid-December and mid-February, the prealternate molt did not appear to interfere with aging birds in the hand by the pattern of the eye ring and chin in basic plumage. Age determination later in the spring, however, remains to be investigated."
GEOGRAPHIC AND SEASONAL VARIATION IN MERCURY EXPOSURE OF THE DECLINING RUSTY BLACKBIRD,"['Edmonds, ST', 'Evers, DC', 'Cristol, DA', 'Mettke-Hofmann, C', 'Powell, LL', 'McGann, AJ', 'Armiger, JW', 'Lane, OP', 'Tessler, DF', 'Newell, P', 'Heyden, K', ""O'Driscoll, NJ""]",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100145,NOV 2010,32,"Recent evidence suggests that mercury exposure has negative effects on the health of songbirds, and species that forage in wetlands may be at a greater risk of bioaccumulation of mercury than are those of other habitats. We examined mercury concentrations in blood and feathers from the wetland obligate and rapidly declining Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) from five regions across North America: three wintering areas in the contiguous United States and breeding areas in the western boreal forests of Alaska and the Acadian forests of northeastern North America. In blood, mercury concentrations in Rusty Blackbirds from the Acadian forest (geometric mean 0.94 mu g g(-1); n = 59) were >3x than in those from Alaska (0.26 mu g g(-1); 107). Wintering birds had blood mercury levels approximately an order of magnitude lower than those of breeding birds (0.07 mu g g(-1); 332). In feathers, mercury concentrations in samples from the Acadian forests exceeded published minimum levels for adverse effects on birds (8.26 mu g g(-1); 45) and were 3x to 7x those observed from the other regions. The mercury concentrations we report in blood and feathers of the Acadian forest population of the Rusty Blackbird are among the highest reported for wild populations of passerines at sites without a known local source of mercury. Mercury should be considered as a potential contributor to the species' dramatic population decline in New England and the Maritime provinces and in other areas where bioavailability of mercury is high."
A Loose Colony of Rusty Blackbirds Nesting in Northern Maine,"['Powell, LL', 'Hodgman, TP', 'Glanz, WE', 'Osenton, JD', 'Ellis, DM']",NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST,10.1656/045.017.0409,2010,0,"Euphagus carolinus (Rusty Blackbird) has suffered a steep population decline over the past 40 years, yet we still understand little of the basic biology of the species, particularly its social organization. During the spring of 2007, we located a loose colony of Rusty Blackbirds breeding in Piscataquis County, ME. The core colony consisted of six nests within 6.9 ha. These nests were located within a 70-ha clearcut dominated by regenerating Picea rubens (Red Spruce), P mariana (Black Spruce), and Ales balsamea (Balsam Fir). Within 1500 m of the core colony, we located two ""satellite"" nests in young forests regenerating from heavy partial harvests. We observed mobbing behavior by multiple individuals from different pairs, suggesting that coloniality in this species may be an antipredator strategy."
