New and notable records of Odonata from Texas,"['Abbott, JC']",SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST,NA,SEP 2005,1,"A dramatic increase in interest in the North American Odonata (dragonfly and damselfly) fauna in the last few years has lead to many new discoveries, particularly in southern areas where subtropical species seem to be expanding their range northward. I report the occurrence of eight Odonata species previously unknown from Texas: Argia oenea Hagen in Selys [Coenagrionidae], Enallagma antennaturn (Say) [Coenagrionidae], Leptobasis melinogaster Gonzales-Soriano [Coenagrionidae], Aeshna persephone Donnelly [Aeshnidae), Anax concolor Bauer [Aeshnidael, Phyllocycla breviphylla Belle [Gomphidae], Erythemis attala (Selys) [Libellulidael, and Erythemis mithroides (Brauer) [Libellulidael. These discoveries include four species previously unknown from the United States and the first occurrence of the genus Leptobasis in the country. Additionally, I discuss recent records of several other species rarely reported from Texas."
