"Retrospective Comparison of the Occurrence and Abundance of Rusty Blackbird in the Mackenzie Valley, Northwest Territories","['Machtans, CS', 'Van Wilgenburg, SL', 'Armer, LA', 'Hobson, KA']",AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY,NA,JUN 2007,7,"Rusty Blackbird is listed as a species of ""special concern"" by the Committee On the Status of Endangered Wildlife In Canada, and has shown steep population declines in recent decades. Forty-five locations with historical survey data from the 1970s in the Mackenzie Valley, Northwest Territories, Canada were revisited in 2006 to check for changes in the occurrence or abundance of Rusty Blackbird. Our retrospective analysis revealed a number of analytical challenges for such comparisons that we describe. The number of lakes on which this species occurred does not appear to have declined significantly in the past three decades when a correction for survey duration was applied. The range-wide decline of 5.1%/yr based on Christmas Bird Count data would have resulted in 2006 occupancy at approximate to 5 lakes. We estimate that with correction this would have increased to approximate to 26. However, naive or unadjusted analyses with a Chi-squared test showed a significant decline. A simulated resampling of the historical data was performed using a repeatability factor of 62% that was derived from a subset of historical lakes that was visited twice in the 1970s. Only 8 of 13 lakes resurveyed had the same results on both historical visits. Our unadjusted 2006 results are a likely outcome, i.e., a 14.9% chance of finding this result, when this repeatability factor is considered, and the likelihood of no change is higher when our corrected data are considered. The possibility of double counting in the historical data further reduced the likelihood of a large decline in relative abundance. Therefore, Rusty Blackbird occurrence does not appear to have changed significantly in the past 33 yr in the Mackenzie Valley. We conclude with a qualitative discussion that supports the notion that declines in the southern parts of their range may be a large factor in the observed rates of population decline."
"Important bird and mammal records in the Thelon River valley, Northwest Territories: Range expansions and possible causes","['Norment, CJ', 'Hall, A', 'Hendricks, P']",CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST,NA,JUL-SEP 1999,8,"Included in information on the status of 50 bird species and five mammal species in the Thelon River valley, Northwest Territories are nine northward and three southward breeding range extensions for birds, along with 16 species not previously recorded in the Thelon Wildlife Sanctuary. Thirty of the bird species, along with Red Squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), Moose (Alces alces), Porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), River Otter (Lutra canadensis), and Beaver (Castor canadensis) were not reported by either J. C. Critchell-Bullock or C. H. D. Clarke during reconnaisances of the Thelon River area during the 1920s and 1930s. Although recent, increased search effort may explain many of these differences, it is likely that the Common Loon (Gavia immer), Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), American Widgeon (Anas americana), Surf Scoter (Melanitta perspicillata), Gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), Yellow-rumped Warbler (Dendroica coronata), Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus), Moose, and Red Squirrel have established breeding populations in the Thelon River area since the 1930s. Several hypotheses may explain northward range expansions, including a recent warming trend at the northern treeline during the 1970s and 1980s. Although apparent changes in the mammalian and avian faunas are consistent with an hypothesis linked to climate change, correlational studies are probably inadequate to link climate change causally with changes in species distribution."
