"Xantusiid ""night"" lizards: a puzzling phylogenetic problem revisited using likelihood-based Bayesian methods on mtDNA sequences","['Vicario, S', 'Caccone, A', 'Gauthier, J']",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/S1055-7903(02)00313-5,FEB 2003,34,"Contentious issues in Night Lizard (Xantusiidae) evolution are revisited using Maximum Likelihood-based Bayesian methods and compared with results from Neighbor-Joining and Maximum Parsimony analyses. Fragments of three mitochondrial genes, the 12S and 16S ribosomal genes, and the cytochrome b gene, are sampled across an ingroup composed of seven xantusiid species and a 12-species outgroup chosen to bracket ancestral states for six additional clades of scleroglossan lizards. Our phylogenetic analyses afford robust support for the following conclusions: Xantusiidae is part of Scincomorpha, rather than being allied with Gekkota; Lepidophyma is sister to Xantusia, rather than to Cricosaura; Xantusia riversiana is imbedded within, rather than being sister to, other Xantusia species; and rock-morph Xantusia are not closely related to one another. Convergence related to retarded rates of growth and development, or to physical constraints imposed by living in rock crevices, may be responsible for much of the character discordance underlying conflicts in xantusiid phylogeny. Fossil-calibrated Maximum Likelihood-based divergence time estimates suggest that although the xantusiid stem may have originated in the Mesozoic, the crown clade is exclusively Tertiary in age. Thus, the clade including extant Cricosaura does not appear to have been extant during the K-T boundary bolide impact, as has been suggested. Moreover, our divergence-time estimates indicate that the xantusiid island endemics, Cricosaura typica on Cuba and Xantusia riversiana on the California Channel Islands, arrived via dispersal rather than vicariance, as previously proposed.

"Xantusiid lizards have low energy, water, and food requirements","['Mautz, WJ', 'Nagy, KA']",PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY,10.1086/317742,JUL-AUG 2000,10,"Lizards in the family Xantusiidae (the night lizards) are known to have resting metabolic rates that are only half those of other lizards of comparable size. We evaluated whether xantusiids also have low field metabolic rates (FMR) and food requirements by measuring FMR and water flux rates with doubly labeled water in three xantusiid species in their natural habitats. Free-living Xantusia vigilis, Xantusia henshawi, and Xantusia riversiana processed energy and water very slowly, about one-third as fast as do other reptiles of similar size. Xantusiid lizards have a distinctive life history that is characterized by very slow growth and low reproductive rates, and they are intensely reclusive. This general lifestyle is also found in some species that live in environments with scarce food resources, such as in caves and in arid habitats, and these species may also have relatively low energy requirements."
