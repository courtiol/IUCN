Soil-plant hydrology of indigenous and exotic trees in an Ethiopian montane forest,"['Fritzsche, F', 'Abate, A', 'Fetene, M', 'Beck, E', 'Weise, S', 'Guggenberger, G', 'HYDRAULIC REDISTRIBUTION', 'NORTHERN AUSTRALIA']",TREE PHYSIOLOGY,NA,AUG 2006,26,"Fast-growing exotic trees are widely planted in the tropics to counteract deforestation; however, their patterns of water use could be detrimental to overall ecosystem productivity through their impact on ecosystem water budget. In a comparative field study on seasonal soil-plant water dynamics of two exotic species (Cupressus lisitanica Mill. and Eucalyptus globulus Labill.) and the indigenous Podocarpus falcatus (Thunb.) Mirb. in south Ethiopia, we combined a 2.5-year record for climate and soil water availability, natural-abundance oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) of soil and xylem water, destructive root sampling and transpiration measurements. Soil was generally driest under C. lusitanica with its dense canopy and shallow root system, particularly following a relatively low-rainfall wet season, with the wettest soil under E. globulus. Wet season transpiration of C lusitanica was twice that of the other species. In the dry season, P.falcatus and C. lusitanica reduced transpiration by a factor of six and two, respectively, whereas E. globulus showed a fivefold increase. In all species, there was a shift in water uptake to deeper soil layers as the dry season progressed, accompanied by relocation of live fine root biomass (LFR) of C lusitanica and P. falcatus to deeper layers. Under R falcatus, variability in soil matric potential, narrow delta O-18 depth gradients and high LFR indicated fast water redistribution. Subsoil water uptake was important only for E. globulus, which had low topsoil LFR and tap roots exploiting deep water. Although P.falcatus appeared better adapted to varying soil water availability than the exotic species, both conifers decreased growth substantially during dry weather. Growth of L globulus was largely independent of topsoil water content, giving it the potential to cause substantial dry-season groundwater depletion."
"Transformation of a Podocarpus falcatus dominated natural forest into a monoculture Eucalyptus globulus plantation at Munesa, Ethiopia: soil organic C, N and S dynamics in primary particle and aggregate-size fractions","['Ashagrie, Y', 'Zech, W', 'Guggenberger, G']",AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,10.1016/j.agee.2004.07.015,MAR 30 2005,35,"Changes in land use and management can affect soil structure, soil organic carbon (SOC) and other nutrients reserve (such as N, P, S). We analyzed organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (N), and total sulfur (S) in particle-size, aggregate-size and size/density fractions of soil organic matter (SOM) in order to identify the SOM pools most affected by the conversion of a Podocarpus falcatus dominated mixed natural forest into a monoculture Eucalyptus globulus plantation 21 years ago on a reddish brown Nitisol at Munesa, Ethiopia. Bulk soil OC, N, and S concentrations and stocks in soil to 20 cm depth were not significantly changed after the conversion of the natural forest into Eucalyptus plantation, but C/N ratio narrowed significantly. Soil organic C, N and S concentrations, and C/N and C/S ratios in sand and silt separates from the plantation samples were significantly reduced, while clay N and S concentrations had slightly increased. The losses of SOC, N and S in the sand fraction were more pronounced than that in the silt. Aggregate stability and total SOC, N and S concentrations of the aggregates were not significantly different in samples from the Eucalyptus plantation and the natural forest. In the plantation samples, both the free light fraction (LF) and the intra-particulate organic matter (iPOM) C, N and S concentrations associated with the macro-aggregates were significantly reduced. Differences in the total amount of the free LF (on the basis of water-stable aggregates proportion) between the two forest types were not apparent, suggesting that SOM quality is more prone to changes in land use and soil management strategies than the total amount of SOM. The loss of iPOM was higher than that of free LF probably due to gaseous losses of organic matter (OM) inside the aggregates caused by high fire temperatures during clearing and site preparation. In both forest types, the LF OM comprised the highest percentage of whole soil OM and the loss of particulate organic matter (POM) accounted for much of the losses of OM. Overall, the results showed that analysis of OC, N and S concentrations in soil particle and aggregate-sizes, and size/density fraction of SOM allowed sensitive detection of changes in SOM dynamics and soil fertility resulting from changes in land use.

"Water relations of indigenous versus exotic tree species, growing at the same site in a tropical montane forest in southern Ethiopia","['Fetene, M', 'Beck, EH']",TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,10.1007/s00468-004-0321-3,JUL 2004,22,"The objective of the study was to compare the water relations of two indigenous [Podocarpus falcatus (Thunb.) Endl., Croton macrostachys Hochst. ex. Del.] and two exotic tree species (Eucalyptus globulus Labille., Cupressus lusitanica Miller) growing in the same location in the montane Munessa State Forest, southern Ethiopia. Stem flow was measured with Granier type thermal dissipation probes. Sap flux, normalized per unit sapwood area, and the total sapwood areas of the particular trees were used to estimate daily transpiration. Maximum daily transpiration values (60 kg water) were recorded for Croton when at full foliage. After shedding most of its leaves in the dry season transpiration was reduced to 8 kg per day. Eucalyptus had the next highest transpiration (55 kg), in this case at the peak of the dry season. It transpired 4-5 times more than Podocarpus and Cupressus trees of similar size. Maximum stem flux density was tree-size dependent only in Croton. Diurnal patterns of stem flux indicated that Croton, Eucalyptus and Podocarpus, in contrast to Cupressus, responded more directly to light than to atmospheric water pressure deficit. At high VPD (>1.0 kPa) stem flux reached a plateau in Croton and Podocarpus indicating stomatal limitation. Per unit leaf area Croton had the highest and Podocarpus and Cupressus the lowest daily transpiration rates. In summary, the pioneer tree Croton had the lowest and Podocarpus the highest water use efficiency. The contribution of the study to the understanding of the role of each tree species in the hydrology of the natural forest and the plantations is discussed."
Comparative characterization of photosynthetic performance and water relations of native trees and exotic plantation trees in an Ethiopian forest,"['Luttge, U', 'Berg, A', 'Fetene, M', 'Nauke, P', 'Peter, D', 'Beck, E']",TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,10.1007/s00468-002-0201-7,JAN 2003,18,"Comparative ecophysiological studies by measurements of photosystem 11 chlorophyll a fluorescence, porometry and stable isotope analyses were performed on regrowth of trees in a plantation of Eucalyptus saligna in Ethiopia. In the Shashemene-Munessa State Forest of the eastern escarpment of the Great Rift Valley, young plants of E. saligna and the native tree Podocarpus falcatus were compared under the canopy of an established E. saligna plantation, and the native tree Bersama abyssinica was also included. For further comparison fully sun-exposed plants of Eucalyptus globulus in a young newly established plantation, and trees of P. falcatus and the native pioneer tree Croton macrostachys in a remnant natural forest were examined. Photosynthetic yield measurements and light response curves suggested a gradation of sun-adapted to shade-adapted behaviour of E. globulus (exposed) > C. macrostachys much greater than E. saligna (understorey) greater than or equal to P falcatus similar or equal to B. abyssinica. As indicated by carbon isotope discrimination, long-term water-use efficiency (WUE) tended to be higher in P. falcatus than in E. saligna in the understorey of the plantation. Transpiration measurements showed that Eucalyptus spp had the highest and P. falcatus the lowest instant leaf conductance for water vapour. Thus, P. falcatus competes well photosynthetically and by a more favourable WUE. These measurements support the expectation that the E. saligna plantation has a nurse effect for regrowth of native trees. With the management practice of regularly coppicing E. saligna in a 7-year rhythm a native R falcatus forest may regenerate."
