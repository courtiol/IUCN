New records and a status assessment of a rare dwarf brocket deer from the montane forests of Bolivia,"['Rumiz, DI', 'Pardo, E', 'Eulert, CF', 'Arispe, R', 'Wallace, RB', 'Gomez, H', 'Rios-Uzeda, B']",JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00226.x,APR 2007,1,"Two skeletons, tracks, faecal pellets, photographs and local reports are described and compared with the few previous records of dwarf Andean deer from Bolivia and Peru. Tarsal bones and incisor teeth were diagnostic traits for Mazama and not for Pudu, while skull measurements, ear shape, body colour and facial patterns were consistent with descriptions of Mazama chunyi. Twenty-five new localities (including more than 60 sites in La Paz and Cochabamba) extended significantly the previously known range for M. chunyi in Bolivia. It occurs in Madidi, Apolobamba, Pilon Lajas, Cotapata, Carrasco and probably Isiboro Secure protected areas, in habitats ranging from grasslands and Polylepis elfin forests of the 'ceja de Yungas' at 3600 m to sub-Andean forests at 1000 m. A geographical information system modelled geographic distribution area based on altitude and ecological zone estimates a potential range of about 45 717 km(2) in Bolivia. About 36% of this range (or 41% of the extent of occurrence) is degraded and fragmented, but the rest seems to be in relatively good conservation status. Habitat decline and a limited area of occupancy estimated for Bolivia (and suspected for Peru) suggest that M. chunyi's conservation status should be updated from Data Deficient to Vulnerable VU A4c; B2a+b(iii)."
Latin American deer diversity and conservation: A review of status and distribution,"['Weber, M', 'Gonzalez, S']",ECOSCIENCE,NA,2003,27,"We reviewed the scientific literature published from 1940 to 2002 on Latin American (Mexican and Central and South American) deer (Mammalia: Cervidae), focusing on conservation status and prediction of geographic distributions. The extant Latin American deer are the most diverse deer assemblage in the world (Cervinae: one genus, one species: Elk [Cervus elaphus]; Odocoilineae: six genera, 18 species: White-tailed deer [Odocoileus virginianus], mule deer [O. hemionus], marsh deer [Blastocerus dochotomus], pampas deer [Ozotoceros bezoarticus], huemul [Hippocamelus bisulcus], taruca [Hippocamelus antisensis], greater pudu [Pudu mephistophiles], lesser pudu [Pudu pudu], and six recognized species of brocket deer [Mazama americana, M. gouazoubira, M. nana, M. bricenni, M. chunyi, and M. rufina] as well as three recently proposed species [M. pandora, M. rondoni, and M. bororo]). Within this group, three genera (Odocoileus, Hippocamelus, and Blastocerus) have been well studied, whereas the genus Mazama, P. puda, P. mephistophiles, and H. antisensis have received little attention. The marsh deer, pampas deer, taruca, huemul, lesser pudu, and two Mazama species (Mazama nana and M. bororo) are the most endangered species. They are each listed as Convention International for the Trade of Endangered Species Appendix I and are considered by the International Union for Nature Conservation to be near threatened or endangered. We updated or created distribution maps for these species. Current research predominantly centres on easily available species (e.g., white-tailed deer in Mexico) or endangered species (e.g., marsh deer in Brazil). In contrast, the ecology and conservation status of the pudu, taruca, and Mazama sp. remain largely unknown."
