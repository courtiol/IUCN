Optimal sampling frequency and timing of threatened tropical bird populations: A modeling approach,"['Banks, JE', 'Banks, HT', 'Rinnovatore, K', 'Jackson, CM']",ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.02.005,MAY 10 2015,0,"Conservation of threatened or endangered species relies critically on accurate population counts over time. In practice, many population censuses are conducted by non-governmental organizations or volunteer citizen scientists who are constrained by fiscal and temporal resources. Less than optimal sampling regimens (characterized by infrequent and/or irregular schedules) for conducting population censuses can result in woefully misleading population estimates and thus have dire consequences for management and conservation. We illustrate this using an East African case study in which 14 years of bird data was collected in the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest in coastal Kenya. We first estimate life history parameters in a discrete matrix model. Desiring a data collection protocol which would lessen observation error and lend to a deeper understanding of population projections and dynamics of a threatened species, we carry out mathematical and statistical modeling efforts with an adaptation of a Leslie model for simulated population estimates stemming from different population sampling schemes. We illustrate how resource managers might take a strategic approach, using simple quantitative models, to develop an optimal sampling scheme that considers important species traits, such as breeding season, and balances the tradeoff between resources and accuracy.

"Forest-type preference of an Afrotropical thrush (East Coast Akalat Sheppardia gunningi sokokensis) in Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, Kenya","['Banks, JE', 'Jackson, C', 'Baya, A', 'Minnella, H', 'Nitz, M', 'Hitchcock, J', 'Bruinsma, D']",OSTRICH,10.2989/00306525.2012.710271,2012,1,NA
Threatened bird species on two little-known mountains (Chiperone and Mabu) in northern Mozambique,"['Spottiswoode, CN', 'Patel, IH', 'Herrmann, E', 'Timberlake, J', 'Bayliss, J']",OSTRICH,10.2989/OSTRICH.2008.79.1.1.359,APR 2008,5,"The montane forests of northern Mozambique and southern Malawi support several bird species of global conservation concern, and particularly in Malawi are seriously threatened by deforestation. However, the status of these in northern Mozambique remains poorly known. We report that some 1 600 ha of mid-altitude and montane evergreen forest still exists on Mt Chiperone, and that two globally threatened bird species last reported from this locality in 1950, Thyolo Alethe Alethe choloensis (IUCN status Endangered) and White-winged Apalis Apalis chariessa (Vulnerable), still occur there. Mt Mabu, which to the best of our knowledge was previously biologically undescribed, also has extensive evergreen forest (possibly > 5000 ha) and also supports two globally threatened bird species, Thyolo Alethe and East Coast Akalat Sheppardia gunningi (Vulnerable). Range extensions of several forest bird taxa of lesser conservation concern are also reported. The evergreen forests on both mountains appear not to have suffered from any substantial human encroachment and do not seem to be under imminent threat, although more extensive surveys are needed. Our records of Thyolo Alethe suggest that its global population is substantially larger than previously thought and that uplisting to Critically Endangered might not be warranted."
