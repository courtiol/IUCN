Evidence for placing the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) into the family Gavialidae: Inferences from nuclear gene sequences,"['Willis, RE', 'McAliley, LR', 'Neeley, ED', 'Densmore, LD']",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.ympev.2007.02.005,JUN 2007,20,"The extant crocodylians comprise 23 species divided among three families, Alligatoridae, Crocodylidae, and Gavialidae. Currently, based on morphological data sets, Tomistoma schlegelii (false gharial) is placed within the family Crocodylidae. Molecular data sets consistently support a sister-taxon relationship of T schlegelii with Gavialis gangeticus (Indian Gharial), which is the sole species in Gavialidae. To elucidate the placement of T schlegelii within the extant crocodylians, we have sequenced 352 bp of the dentin matrix protein I (DMPI) nuclear gene in 30 individuals and 424 bp of the nuclear gene C-mos in 74 individuals. Molecular analysis of the DMPI data set indicates that it is highly conserved within the Crocodylia. Of special note is a seven base-pair indel (GTGCTTT) shared by T schlegelii and G. gangeticus, that is absent in the genus Crocodylus, Osteolaemus, and Mecistops. To date, C-mos is the largest molecular data set analyzed for any crocodylian study including multiple samples from all representatives of the eight extant genera. Analysis of these molecular data sets, both as individual gene sequences and concatenated sequences, support the hypothesis that T. schlegelii should be placed within the family Gavialidae.

A gharial from the Oligocene of Puerto Rico: transoceanic dispersal in the history of a non-marine reptile,"['Velez-Juarbe, J', 'Brochu, CA', 'Santos, H']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rspb.2006.0455,MAY 22 2007,20,"The Indian gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) is not found in saltwater, but the geographical distribution of fossil relatives suggests a derivation from ancestors that lived in, or were at least able to withstand, saline conditions. Here, we describe a new Oligocene gharial, Aktiogavialis puertoricensis, from deltaic - coastal deposits of northern Puerto Rico. It is related to a clade of Neogene gharials otherwise restricted to South America. Its geological and geographical settings, along with its phylogenetic relationships, are consistent with two scenarios: (i) that a single trans-Atlantic dispersal event during the Tertiary explains the South American Neogene gharial assemblage and (ii) that stem gharials were coastal animals and their current restriction to freshwater settings is a comparatively recent environmental shift for the group. This discovery highlights the importance of including fossil information in a phylogenetic context when assessing the ecological history of modern organisms."
The complete mitochondrial genome of salt-water crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) and phylogeny of crocodilians.,"['Li, Yan', 'Wu, Xiaobing', 'Ji, Xuefeng', 'Yan, Peng', 'Amato, George']",Journal of genetics and genomics = Yi chuan xue bao,10.1016/S1673-8527(07)60013-7,2007-Feb,14,"The nucleotide sequence of the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule of the salt-water crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) was determined in this article. The molecule is 16,917 base pairs (bp) in length, and codes for 22 tRNAs, 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs, as well as a control region (D-loop), as is characteristic for mitochondrial genomes of other metazoans. The gene order conforms to that of other crocodilians sequenced, but the arrangement of some tRNA genes differs from other vertebrates. It shows that the gene order of crocodilians is remarkably conserved. In this study, the relationships among crocodilians were examined in the phylogenetic analysis based on the control conserved regions of 17 crocodilians. The results suggest that the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) joins the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) on a common branch, and then constitutes a sister group to traditional Crocodylidae. Thus, the result supports that G. gangeticus belongs to Crocodylidae. The analyses also suggest that the African slender-snouted crocodile (Crocodylus cataphractus) can be treated as an isolated genus, and constitutes a sister group to Crocodylus."
New material of Argochampsa krebsi (Crocodylia : Gavialoidea) from the Lower Paleocene of the Oulad Abdoun Basin (Morocco): phylogenetic implications,"['Jouve, S', 'Iarochene, M', 'Bouya, B', 'Amaghzaz, M']",GEOBIOS,10.1016/j.geobios.2005.07.003,NOV-DEC 2006,10,"New material from the Lower Paleocene of the Oulad Abdoun Basin, Morocco, including postcranial material permits a new description of Argochampsa krebsi. The odontoid process of the axis bears a strong lateral apophysis, continuous on the anterolateral margin of the centrum. This process has never been observed such developed in other crocodylians. The single preserved posterior cervical vertebra exhibits a particularly short neural spine, much shorter than that is observed in Alligator mississippiensis, Crocodylus porosus, and Gavialis gangeticus. A phylogenetic analysis, including new coding of A. krebsi, provide a result that is globally congruent with previous works, but differs significantly in the relationships of the gavialoids. A. krebsi is more closely related to G. gangeticus than is Eogavialis africanum. The South American Ikanogavialis gameroi and Gryposuchus colombianus form a polytomy, and are more closely related to G. gangeticus than is Piscogavialis jugaliper-foratus, a gavialoid from Peru. The South American gavialoids may thus not be monophyletic. This result may indicate, contrary to previous result, a more complex paleobiogeographic history. Thus, a multiple invasion of South America by gavialoids from Africa is equally parsimonious with a single invasion, and an invasion from South American to Asia is equally parsimonious with an invasion froth Africa.

"Conservation and biomonitoring in the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, Bihar, India","['Choudhary, SK', 'Smith, BD', 'Dey, S', 'Dey, S', 'Prakash, S']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605306000664,APR 2006,5,"From March 2001 to December 2003 eight direct count surveys in an upstream direction were conducted for Ganges river dolphins Platanista gangetica gangetica in the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, a c. 60 km long segment of the middle Ganges River in Bihar, India. The mean number of dolphins recorded during upstream surveys was 119.4 +/- 31.8 (range 88-174), with an encounter rate of 1.8 dolphins km(-1) (range 1.4-2.8). During these surveys a rich diversity of other threatened aquatic wildlife was also documented, including the Indian smooth-coated otter Lutrogale perspicillata, gharial Gavialis gangeticus, a variety of freshwater turtles, and 135 water bird species. An assessment of fisheries documented 76 fish species of which 43% were caught exclusively in monofilament gill nets, a gear known to kill dolphins by entanglement. Eight new records of fishes preyed upon by Ganges river dolphins were identified from the stomach contents of two dolphin carcasses (Setipinna brevifilis, Osteobrama cotio cotio, Puntius sophore, Crosochelius latius, Mystus cavasius, Heteropneustus fossilis, Macrognathus pancalus, Sperata seenghala). These fishes and other species previously recorded in the diet of the dolphins composed 33.3% of the total catch sampled in 2001-2003. Interviews of 108 fishing households revealed that literacy rates were low (29.9%) and almost 50% earned less than USD 411 per year. The most important conservation actions that could be taken are for national and state governments to establish civil control and promote the development of community-based fishing cooperatives. These cooperatives could enjoy ownership rights to certain river segments in exchange for employing sustainable fishing techniques that are less injurious to dolphins."
A check-list of the pentastomid parasites of crocodilians and freshwater chelonians,"['Junker, K', 'Boomker, J']",ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH,NA,MAR 2006,10,"Based on published records and own data a summary is given of the geographical distribution of the currently known species of pentastomid parasites infecting crocodiles and alligators, as well as freshwater chelonians. A brief generic diagnosis is provided for each genus.

Fourteen out of the currently 23 living crocodilian species have been recorded as being host to one or more pentastomes. Out of the 32 pentastome species six are considered species inquirendae. Presently, six genera of crocodilian pentastomes, Agema, Alofia, Leiperia, Sebekia, Selfia and Subtriquetra are recognized. African crocodiles harbour eight pentastome species, six of which have been recorded from the Nile crocodile, Crocodylus niloticus. Three species belong to the genus Sebekia, Alofia being represented by two and Leiperia by only one species. Two species, Alofia parva and Agema silvae-palustris, occur in the dwarf crocodile, Osteolaemus tetraspis, and the slender-snouted crocodile, Crocodylus cataphractus, exclusively, but a single Sebekia species is shared with the Nile crocodile. The genus Agema is endemic to the African region. Infective stages of the pentastome Subtriquetra rileyi, thought to utilize Nile crocodiles as final hosts, have been recovered only from fishes. The largest number of pentastome species is found in the Australasian region. Of these, the Indo-Pacific crocodile, Crocodylus porosus, harbours seven, representing the genera Alofia, Sebekia, Leiperia and Selfia. Selfia is exclusive to the latter host. The genus Subtriquetra has been reported from ""Indian crocodiles"", a term possibly referring to either Crocodylus palustris, Crocodylus porosus or Gavialis gangeticus. Ten species of pentastomes parasitizing the crocodilian genera Alligator, Caiman, Crocodylus and Melanosuchus have been recorded from the Neotropical region including the southern states of the North American continent. The two most wide-spread pentastome genera, Alofia and Sebekia, have been recorded together with representatives of the genus Subtriquetra and immature and larval forms of Leiperia.

To date the two monospecific genera, Pelonia, from two terrapin species, Pelusios sinuatus and Pelomedusa subrufa, in South Africa, and Diesingia from Hydraspis geoffroyana and Hydromedusa tectifera in South America, are the only chelonian pentastomes recovered world-wide. A possible exception is the crocodilian pentastome Sebekia mississippiensis which can reach maturity in experimentally infected terrapins."
Chompy: An infestation of MITE-like repetitive elements in the crocodilian genome,"['Ray, DA', 'Hedges, DJ', 'Herke, SW', 'Fowlkes, JD', 'Barnes, EW', 'LaVie, DK', 'Goodwin, LM', 'Densmore, LD', 'Batzer, MA']",GENE,10.1016/j.gene.2005.07.010,DEC 5 2005,10,"Interspersed repeats are a major component Of Most eukaryotic genomes and have ail impact on genome size and stability, but the repetitive element landscape of crocodilian genomes has not yet been fully investigated. In this report, we provide the first detailed characterization of an interspersed repeat element in any crocodilian genome. Chompy is a putative miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) family initially recovered from the genome of Alligator mississippiensis (American alligator) but also present in the genomes of Crocodylus moreletii (Morelet's crocodile) and Gavialis gangeticus (Indian gharial). The element has all of the hallmarks of MITEs including terminal inverted repeats, possible target site duplications, and a tendency to form secondary structures. We estimate the copy number in the alligator genome to be similar to 46,000 copies. As a result of their size and unique properties, Chompy elements may provide a useful source of genomic variation for crocodilian comparative genomics. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Mitogenomic analyses place the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) on the crocodile tree and provide Pre-K/T divergence times for most crocodilians,"['Janke, A', 'Gullberg, A', 'Hughes, S', 'Aggarwal, RK', 'Arnason, U']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-004-0336-9,NOV 2005,46,"Based on morphological analyses, extant members of the order Crocodylia are divided into three families, Alligatoridae, Crocodylidae, and Gavialidae. Gavialidae includes one species, the gharial, Gavialis gangeticus. In this study we have examined crocodilian relationships in phylogenetic analyses of seven mitochondrial genomes that have been sequenced in their entirety. The analyses did not support the morphologically acknowledged separate position of the gharial in the crocodilian tree. Instead the gharial joined the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) on a common branch that was shown to constitute a sister group to traditional Crocodylidae (less Tomistoma). Thus, the analyses suggest the recognition of only two Crocodylia families, Alligatoridae and Crocodylidae, with the latter encompassing traditional Crocodylidae plus Gavialis/Tomistoma. A molecular dating of the divergence between Alligatoridae and Crocodylidae suggests that this basal split among recent crocodilians took place 140 million years before present, at the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary. The results suggest that at least five crocodillan lineages survived the mass extinction at the KT boundary."
Anatomy and phylogeny of the gavialoid crocodylian Eosuchus lerichei from the Paleocene of Europe,"['Delfino, M', 'Piras, P', 'Smith, T']",ACTA PALAEONTOLOGICA POLONICA,NA,SEP 2005,27,"Originally designated by Dollo in 1907, the holotype of Eosuchus lerichei has never been carefully described but simply cited and compared in a number of papers. This work is an attempt to fill this gap and to place this taxon in a cladistic phylogenetic context. E. lerichei can be considered a valid basal gavialoid from late Paleocene of North Western Europe, sharing the presence of extremely enlarged foramina aerea on quadrates with the coeval Eosuchus minor from eastern North America (formerly described as Gavialis minor). These two species can be considered sister taxa and, for priority reason, they should be both ascribed to genus Eosuchus. The results of the cladistic analysis show that the European species possess characters that can be considered as slightly derived if compared to those of its American relative, suggesting an eastward dispersion from North America before the Paleocene-Eocene boundary and before the full opening of the Atlantic Ocean or local evolution from a basal gavialoid stock similar to E. minor. Both species of Eosuchus come from marine outcrops and represent a further evidence for the salt-water tolerance of the earliest stages of Gavialoidea evolutionary history. Despite the present endemicity of the only living gharial, Gavialis gangeticus, the historical biogeography of gavialoids shows a lost global distribution and reveals several transoceanic dispersals."
True and false gharials: A nuclear gene phylogeny of Crocodylia,"['Harshman, J', 'Huddleston, CJ', 'Bollback, JP', 'Parsons, TJ', 'Braun, MJ']",SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY,10.1080/10635150390197028,JUN 2003,58,"The phylogeny of Crocodylia offers an unusual twist on the usual molecules versus morphology story. The true gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii), as their common names imply, have appeared in all cladistic morphological analyses as distantly related species, convergent upon a similar morphology. In contrast, all previous molecular studies have shown them to be sister taxa. We present the first phylogenetic study of Crocodylia using a nuclear gene. We cloned and sequenced the c-myc proto-oncogene from Alligator mississippiensis to facilitate primer design and then sequenced an 1,100-base pair fragment that includes both coding and noncoding regions and informative indels for one species in each extant crocodylian genus and six avian outgroups. Phylogenetic analyses using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference all strongly agreed on the same tree, which is identical to the tree found in previous molecular analyses: Gavialis and Tomistoma are sister taxa and together are the sister group of Crocodylidae. Kishino-Hasegawa tests rejected the morphological tree in favor of the molecular tree. We excluded long-branch attraction and variation in base composition among taxa as explanations for this topology. To explore the causes of discrepancy between molecular and morphological estimates of crocodylian phylogeny, we examined puzzling features of the morphological data using a priori partitions of the data based on anatomical regions and investigated the effects of different coding schemes for two obvious morphological similarities of the two gharials."
Phylogenetic approaches toward crocodylian history,"['Brochu, CA']",ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES,10.1146/annurev.earth.31.100901.141308,2003,154,"A review of crocodylian phylogeny reveals a more complex history than might have been anticipated. from a direct reading of the fossil record without consideration of phylogenetic relationships. The three main extant crocodylian lineages-Gavialoidea, Alligatoroidea, Crocodyloidea-are known from fossils in the Late Cretaceous, and the group is found nearly worldwide during the Cenozoic. Some groups have distributions that are best explained by the crossing of marine barriers during the Tertiary. Early Tertiary crocodylian faunas are phylogenetically composite, and clades tend to be morphologically uniform and geographically widespread. Later in the Tertiary, Old World crocodylian faunas are more endemic. Crocodylian phylogeneticists face numerous challenges, the most important being the phylogenetic relationships and time of divergence of the two living gharials (Gavialis gangeticus and Tomistoma schlegelii), the relationships among living true crocodiles (Crocodylus), and the relationships among caimans."
Comparative functional morphology of the masticatory apparatus in the long-snouted crocodiles,"['Endo, H', 'Aoki, R', 'Taru, H', 'Kimura, J', 'Sasaki, M', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Arishima, K', 'Hayashi, Y']",ANATOMIA HISTOLOGIA EMBRYOLOGIA-JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE SERIES C,10.1046/j.1439-0264.2002.00396.x,AUG 2002,29,"The masticatory muscles and their related structures of the skull were observed in the Indian gavial (Gavialis gangeticus ), the false gavial (Tomistoma schlegelii ), and the African slender-snouted crocodile (Mecistops cataphractus ) to detail some morphological differences in comparison with the other crocodile species, and to compare and elucidate the functional strategy of themasticatory apparatus in these long-snouted species. The Musculus pterygoideus posterior was relatively smaller in the three species compared with many short-snouted crocodiles. It suggests that the masticatory power in fish-eating long-snouted species is not so high as in the short-snouted crocodiles, while the masticatory muscles were morphologically different among the three long-snouted species as follows. The M. pterygoideus posterior of the false gavial was extended in the lateral side of the lower jaw unlike the Indian gavial. The M. pseudotemporalis and the Fenestra supratemporalis were largely developed in the Indian gavial, however we suggest that the other two species possess the weak bundles in this muscle. The false gavial and the African slender-snouted crocodile have the pterygoid bone well-developed extending dorso-ventrally and it is suggested that the M. adductor mandibulae posterior attached to the pterygoid bone may be much larger than the Indian gavial. These data morphologically clarify the masticatory mechanism in the long-snouted crocodiles different from the short-snouted species, and demonstrate that the evolutional strategy to share the functional role in the masticatory muscles have been differently established between the Indian gavial and the other two species. We also obtained the morphological data in the fossil skull of the Machikane crocodile (Toyotamaphymeia machikanense ) and concluded from the fossil characters that the considerable developments of the M.pterygoideus posterior and the M.pseudotemporalis in this species had not morphologically been consistent with both the Indian and false gavials."
"Reproductive success, hatchling survival and rate of increase of gharial Gavialis gangeticus in National Chambal Sanctuary, India","['Hussain, SA']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,NA,FEB 1999,8,"The gharial Gavialis gangeticus Gmelin is' endemic to the Indian subcontinent and was on the-verge of extinction in India by the mid-1970's. As a conservation measure, since 1979 captive reared gharials have been reintroduced in several protected areas. The reproductive success and hatchling survival in one of these managed populations was determined by monitoring 124 nests between 1987 and 1989. Population rate of increase in a 425 km stretch of the Chambal River, National Chambal Sanctuary, was determined by surveys every alternate year between 1988 and 1992. The mean clutch size (36.51 +/- 0.65 eggs) showed no significant variation between years (ANOVA, F = 0.821, p = 0.443). Number of infertile eggs per clutch was (2.99 +/- 1.160) and no significant difference in the mean number of infertile eggs per nest was found between years (ANOVA, F = 0.534, p = 0.588). The overall fertility was 91.8%. and it did not vary among years (ANOVA, F = 0.075, p = 0.927). A substantial number of eggs (32.1%) were lost between egg laying and hatching, largely due to eggs being damaged during nest searches, predation, desiccation and unknown reasons. Predation losses increased between 1987 and 1989, and varied significantly between years (ANOVA, F = 3.970, p = 0.021). During the study period the overall hatching success was 67.9%. Mean recruitment of 1-year old to the population was 7.7, 8.8 in 1987-1988 and 6.6% in 1989-1990. This indicates 92.3% hatchling mortality within the first year. The egg to post monsoon survivorship was 6.6% in 1987-1988 and 4.3% in 1989-1990; with a mean of 5.5% during the study period. The density of gharial increased from 1.93 gharial/river km in 1988 to 2.52 during 1992. The overall exponential rate of increase in the population was 0.179 (p = 0.012) or equivalent to 19.6% p.a between:1979 and 1992. The total number of nests increased from 45 in 1987 to 57 in 1989. The average annual exponential rate of increase in the nesting between 1979 and 1989 was 0.149 (p = 0.002) or equivalent to 16;1% p.a. Variations in egg and hatchling survivorship, inconsistency in the number of gharial released, the location and the time of release, and mortality in fishing nets are biases in the data.
