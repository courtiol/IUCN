Utilization of mangrove crab-burrow micro-habitats by the goby Redigobius dewaali: Evidence for dominance hierarchy,"['Kramer, R', 'McQuaid, CD', 'Vink, TJF', 'Mostert, BP', 'Wasserman, RJ']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,10.1016/j.jembe.2014.10.012,JAN 2015,0,"When a range of life-history groups within a population exploit similar niches, hierarchies are often established whereby optimal resources are capitalized by dominant individuals. The present study investigates the feeding and movement of a size structured population of gobies residing in crab burrow micro-habitats, within this context. All life-history stages of the goby Redigobius dewaali were found to utilize burrow-pools formed by the crab Scylla serrata in the mangrove intertidal zone of an estuary at low tide. Gut content analysis was therefore conducted to test for feeding overlap and potential intraspecific competition among various sizes of fish residing in these habitats. In addition, an exclosure experiment was conducted to determine whether these fish leave the burrow-pools at high tide to forage over the intertidal flats. While ontogenetic dietary shifts across size-classes occurred, copepods and amphipods comprised the most important components of the diet for most size-classes, resulting in a large degree of dietary overlap. Of the adult R. dewaali sampled from pools, a single large mature male was sampled from each burrow, suggesting territoriality, a trait well observed in males of many goby species. The experimental component of the study highlighted the movement of smaller individuals, but not larger individuals, from the burrow-pools at high tide. As all life-history stages occur in the same microhabitats, and forage on much of the same prey, we suggest that the existence of a competitive hierarchy resulted in the need for the smaller individuals to find alternate feeding areas, consistent with dominance hierarchy theory.

Intertidal crab burrows as a low-tide refuge habitat for a specific gobiid: preliminary evidence for commensalism,"['Wasserman, RJ', 'Mostert, BP', 'AUSTRALIA']",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,10.1071/MF13081,2014,1,"Mud crab (Scylla serrata) burrows in an estuarine mangrove intertidal zone were identified as potential microhabitats for small fishes. The pool-like habitats, created by these burrows, were sampled for fishes during nocturnal and diurnal low tide events, over the new moon period. A total of 1103 fish, comprising a single gobiid species (Redigobius dewaali), were collected from eight burrow-pools. The utilisation of these burrow-pools by large numbers of a single ichthyofaunal species suggests that there is a degree of commensalism between S. serrata and R. dewaali in these intertidal habitats."
Feeding ecology of the early life-history stages of two dominant gobiid species in the headwaters of a warm-temperate estuary,"['Wasserman, RJ']",ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,10.1016/j.ecss.2012.05.003,AUG 20 2012,11,"The diet and population structure of larval and early juvenile Glossogobius callidus and Redigobius dewaali (Gobiidae) were examined from the headwater region of the permanently open Great Fish Estuary along the south-east coast of southern Africa. Stomach contents of five selected size classes were sorted and identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level for each goby species. Using % Index of Relative Importance values, ontogenic shifts and dietary breadth were determined for each species as was dietary overlap between species. Numerically, both gobiid species showed similar temporal and spatial trends. Seasonal differences in catches were evident, although no numerical differences across sampled sites were found. A large degree of dietary overlap was found between the two species. The zooplanktonic diet showed a greater degree of ontogenic shift in R. dewaali than G. callidus, although similar trends were found for both. In both goby species, Calanoid sp. (Copepoda) generally decreased in importance across size classes, being the most important in the smallest size class whilst Corophium sp. (Amphipoda) increased in importance across size classes, being the least important at the smallest size classes. For both G. callidus and R. dewaali, Insecta contributed significantly to at least one of the five size classes. The larger size classes showed the least dietary overlap and the highest niche breadth. In addition, as is the case in many gobiids worldwide, the larger size classes of both sampled gobiid species consumed a broader prey size range. In conclusion, dietary overlap was largely similar between the young gobiids, suggesting that either food resources are not limiting, or niche separation is attributed to differences in foraging strategies. Ontogenic dietary shifts were however present for both gobiids with regard to prey items and prey size, suggesting a greater degree of foraging niche separation in adults of the species.
