"Biogeographic patterns, origin and speciation of the endemic birds from eastern Brazilian mountaintops: a review","['Chaves, AV', 'Freitas, GHS', 'Vasconcelos, MF', 'Santos, FR']",SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY,10.1080/14772000.2014.972477,JAN 2 2015,0,"We review the main biogeographic and phylogenetic hypotheses about the origin and distribution of the endemic birds from Brazilian mountaintops, a heterogeneous group composed of hummingbirds and passerines living in high-altitude open habitats of campos rupestres, campos de altitude and campos sulinos from southern to north-eastern Brazilian mountaintops (Espinhaco Range, Serra do Mar, Serra da Mantiqueira and Serra Geral). Some authors consider that these birds are probably closely related to other species distributed in cooler areas of South America. We used ranges of these birds, spatial pattern and discontinuities in the distribution of phytophysiognomies to determine potential geographic barriers to dispersal and centres of origin and speciation. We reanalysed biogeographical hypotheses regarding the evolution of the endemic birds from Brazilian mountaintops and their habitats in the light of recent phylogenetic reconstructions that included some of these species. The evolutionary histories of the species Augastes scutatus, Augastes lumachella, Formicivora grantsaui, Polystictus superciliaris and Embernagra longicauda are difficult to assess due to lack of phylogenies that establish their systematic position. For Asthenes luizae, Asthenes moreirae, Cinclodes pabsti and C. espinhacensis, the phylogenies estimate also their lineage divergence times, which allows for inferences concerning connections between the biota of eastern Brazil, southern South America and the Andean mountains. We also identified 26 lowland regions between the mountains that were potentially barriers to dispersal. Phylogenetic relationships strongly highlight the importance of connecting paths and speciation through the south, especially in the cooler areas in South America. These patterns show that eastern Brazil, southern South America and the central and northern Andes are four important centres of origin and radiation for the endemic birds from the eastern Brazilian mountains."
"A new species of Cinclodes from the Espinhaco Range, southeastern Brazil: insights into the biogeographical history of the South American highlands","['Freitas, GHS', 'Chaves, AV', 'Costa, LM', 'Santos, FR', 'Rodrigues, M']",IBIS,10.1111/j.1474-919X.2012.01268.x,OCT 2012,3,"We describe Cinclodes espinhacensis (Furnariidae), a new species discovered at high elevation in the southern portion of the Espinhaco Range, in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. This new taxon is closely related to the Long-tailed Cinclodes Cinclodes pabsti, endemic to Serra Geral, southern Brazil. We present diagnostic morphological, genetic and vocal characters that support the rank of species for this allopatric taxon. It is readily distinguishable from C. pabsti by its much darker back, chest and flanks, lower body mass, shorter tarsus-length, lower frequency of vocalizations, and longer duration of calls. DNA sequence data estimate that the divergence time between this new species and Cinclodes pabsti occurred c. 220 000 years ago, during the late Pleistocene. This discovery illustrates remarkable biogeographical connections among the cold regions of South America. The new species has a restricted range and we suggest it meets the criteria of the IUCN Red List category of Endangered."
