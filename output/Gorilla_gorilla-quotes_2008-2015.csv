Long-Term Spatial Memory and Learning Set Formation in Captive Capuchin Monkeys (Cebus libidinosus = Sapajus cay),"['Tujague, MP', 'Janson, CH', 'Lahitte, HB']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-015-9878-5,DEC 2015,0,"Researchers have long suspected that nonhuman primates have long-term spatial memory for locating food. However, few empirical studies have assessed spatial memory for a period longer than 1 day in nonhuman primates in a foraging context. We used a modified version of the radial maze to test long-term memory for periods of 2 days or longer in two groups of Cebus libidinosus = Sapajus cay (N = 10; N = 6) in captivity (environment completely human constructed) and semicaptivity (relatively natural environment with few human-made structures) at La Plata Zoo and Botanical Park, Buenos Aires, Argentina, between 2007 and 2010. The experimental design included a set of three accessible baited feeders interspersed among three nonaccessible baited feeders. We tested monkeys in one initial exposure period, four periods of long-term memory (2 days, 76 days, 76 + 2 days, and 4 months of delay), and one period of inversion of the experimental set location. We used the latter to analyze the monkeys' abilities to develop learning sets. Captive subjects appeared to remember sites with accessible and nonaccessible food for periods of 2 days, 76 days, and 4 months, and used learning sets to reduce relearning times when exposed to a change in the learned locations. Although semicaptive subjects also appeared to remember sites with accessible and nonaccessible food, their performance was less accurate. We conclude that capuchins used spatial memory to improve their foraging efficiency."
Implications of the Relationship Between Basicranial Flexion and Facial Orientation for the Evolution of Hominid Craniofacial Structures,"['Neaux, D', 'Gilissen, E', 'Coudyzer, W', 'Guy, F']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-015-9886-5,DEC 2015,0,"The basicranium and face have been linked through genetic, developmental, and functional relationships throughout their evolution. As a result, basicranial morphology most likely plays a major role in the evolution of facial structures. We describe the relationships between basicranial flexion and the face in Homo, Pan, and Gorilla to determine the role of cranial base angle reduction in the setup of the short and orthognathic face of Homo. We test the hypotheses that cranial base flexion plays a significant part in variation in facial orientation, length, and projection at the intraspecific level. The sample comprised 125 crania of adult specimens including 66 Homo sapiens, 32 Pan troglodytes, and 27 Gorilla gorilla. We described the cranial base and face using landmarks placed on scans of the surfaces and computed correlations between the cranial base angle and facial orientation, length, and projection. Our results support the hypotheses that cranial base flexion plays a significant part in facial orientation for Homo and Pan and in facial length for Pan. The hypothesis that basicranial flexion is related to a reduction of facial projection is not supported. The findings suggest that basicranial flexion can explain several anatomical specificities of hominins, including the reduction of prognathism and the reduction of the length of the nasopharynx. We found different patterns in the different genera, highlighting the fact that changes in the relationship between craniofacial structures may have occurred during hominid evolution."
"Forearm articular proportions and the antebrachial index in Homo sapiens, Australopithecus afarensis and the great apes","['Williams, FL', 'Cunningham, DL', 'Amaral, LQ']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jchb.2015.07.001,2015,0,"When hominin bipedality evolved, the forearms were free to adopt nonlocomotor tasks which may have resulted in changes to the articular surfaces of the ulna and the relative lengths of the forearm bones. Similarly, sex differences in forearm proportions may be more likely to emerge in bipeds than in the great apes given the locomotor constraints in Gorilla, Pan and Pongo. To test these assumptions, ulnar articular proportions and the antebrachial index (radius length/ulna length) in Homo sapiens (n=51), Gorilla gorilla (n=88), Pan troglodytes (n=49), Pongo pygrnaeus (n=36) and Australopithecus afarensis A.L. 288-1 and A.L. 438-1 are compared. Intercept-adjusted ratios are used to control for size and minimize the effects of allometry. Canonical scores axes show that the proximally broad and elongated trochlear notch with respect to size in H. sapiens and A. afarensis is largely distinct from G. gorilla, P. troglodytes and P. pygmaeus. A cluster analysis of scaled ulnar articular dimensions groups H. sapiens males with A.L. 438-1 ulna length estimates, while one A.L. 288-1 ulna length estimate groups with Pan and another clusters most closely with H. sapiens, G. gorilla and A.L. 438-1. The relatively low antebrachial index Characterizing H. sapiens and non-outlier estimates of A.L. 288-1 and A.L. 438-1 differs from those of the great apes. Unique sex differences in H. sapiens suggest a link between bipedality and forearm functional morphology. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."
"Cocirculation of Two env Molecular Variants, of Possible Recombinant Origin, in Gorilla and Chimpanzee Simian Foamy Virus Strains from Central Africa","['Richard, L', 'Rua, R', 'Betsem, E', 'Mouinga-Ondeme, A', 'Kazanji, M', 'Leroy, E', 'Njouom, R', 'Buseyne, F', 'Afonso, PV', 'Gessain, A']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.01798-15,DEC 2015,0,"Simian foamy virus (SFV) is a ubiquitous retrovirus in nonhuman primates (NHPs) that can be transmitted to humans, mostly through severe bites. In the past few years, our laboratory has identified more than 50 hunters from central Africa infected with zoonotic SFVs. Analysis of the complete sequences of five SFVs obtained from these individuals revealed that env was the most variable gene. Furthermore, recombinant SFV strains, some of which involve sequences in the env gene, were recently identified. Here, we investigated the variability of the env genes of zoonotic SFV strains and searched for possible recombinants. We sequenced the complete env gene or its surface glycoprotein region (SU) from DNA amplified from the blood of (i) a series of 40 individuals from Cameroon or Gabon infected with a gorilla or chimpanzee foamy virus (FV) strain and (ii) 1 gorilla and 3 infected chimpanzees living in the same areas as these hunters. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of two env variants among both the gorilla and chimpanzee FV strains that were present in zoonotic and NHP strains. These variants differ greatly (>30% variability) in a 753-bp-long region located in the receptor-binding domain of SU, whereas the rest of the gene is very conserved. Although the organizations of the Env protein sequences are similar, the potential glycosylation patterns differ between variants. Analysis of recombination suggests that the variants emerged through recombination between different strains, although all parental strains could not be identified.

IMPORTANCE

SFV infection in humans is a great example of a zoonotic retroviral infection that has not spread among human populations, in contrast to human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) and human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs). Recombination was a major mechanism leading to the emergence of HIV. Here, we show that two SFV molecular envelope gene variants circulate among ape populations in Central Africa and that both can be transmitted to humans. These variants differ greatly in the SU region that corresponds to the part of the Env protein in contact with the environment. These variants may have emerged through recombination between SFV strains infecting different NHP species."
"Audience effects, but not environmental influences, explain variation in gorilla close distance vocalizations-A test of the acoustic adaptation hypothesis","['Hedwig, D', 'Mundry, R', 'Robbins, MM', 'Boesch, C']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22462,DEC 2015,0,"Close distance vocalizations are an integral part of primate vocal communication. They exhibit large acoustic variation which has been suggested to constitute flexible responses to the highly variable social setting of group living animals. However, a recent study suggested that acoustic variation in close distance calls of baboons may also arise from acoustic adaptations to environmental factors in order to counteract sound degradation. We tested whether the variation in calling rate and acoustic structure of gorilla close distance vocalizations may serve to counteract distorting effects of vegetation during sound propagation. Using focal animal sampling we recorded the vocal behavior of 15 adult individuals living in two groups: one group of western lowland gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla and one group of mountain gorillas Gorilla beringei beringei. We considered the distance between the caller and its nearest neighbor as the minimum transmission distance of calls; while vegetation density was quantified through measures of visibility. Our analysis revealed vocal plasticity in gorilla close calls in relation to changes in visibility and nearest neighbor distance. However, the observed changes in fundamental frequency and calling rate are unlikely to counteract degrading effects of vegetation, but rather seem to reflect reactions to variation in spatial and visual separation from other group members, similar to the audience effects demonstrated in a range of other species. We propose that vocal plasticity to counteract distorting environmental effects may not be prevalent across taxa and perhaps confined to species living in heterogeneous habitats with highly variable transmission conditions.

"Age-related motor dysfunction: Manual slowing in Gorilla gorilla gorilla
","['Mahovetz, LM', 'Stoinski, TS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22484,DEC 2015,0,"Aging in humans and rhesus monkeys is commonly associated with motor function decrements including dexterity, speed, and strength. Despite their longevity and phylogenetic relatedness to humans, the effects of aging on motor function in non-human apes have been minimally studied. We conducted two experiments with western lowland gorillas (11-54 years of age) to determine whether aged gorillas exhibit motor deficits similar to those seen in other species. In experiment one, gorillas extracted up to 12 food rewards lodged in holes of a Lexan board. Extraction rates were calculated for eight test sessions. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed no main effects of session or sex on extraction rate, but a significant main effect of age. Comparisons between the first and last sessions showed that experience significantly improved extraction rates in young but not aged gorillas. In experiment two, gorillas retrieved a hex nut from three differently shaped rods with each hand for a reward. Latencies of retrieval were calculated for 16 test sessions. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant main effects of age class, sex, and session. There were significant interactions between session and sex, session and age, and session, sex, and age. These findings held when analyzing each rod shape separately. Post hoc comparisons revealed that young gorillas were significantly faster at the task than aged gorillas, and females were faster than males. This finding held only for the question mark shaped rod when analyzing each rod shape separately. Comparisons between the first and last sessions showed that experience did not significantly improve latencies in either age or sex class. The direction of these results are congruent with previous findings in humans and monkeys and suggest that aged gorillas experience deficits in bimanual coordination compared to younger gorillas and that age and sex influence fine motor ability in gorillas.

The recent development of non-invasive methods allowed re-exploration of plasmodial diversity in African apes. Although a large number of great ape populations have now been studied regarding Plasmodium infections in Africa, there are still vast areas of their distribution that remained unexplored. Gabon constitutes an important part of the range of western central African great ape subspecies (Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla), but has not been studied so far. In the present study, the diversity of Plasmodium species circulating in great apes in Gabon was analysed.

METHODS: The analysis of 1,261 faecal samples from 791 chimpanzees and 470 gorillas collected from 24 sites all over Gabon was performed. Plasmodium infections were characterized by amplification and sequencing of a portion of the Plasmodium cytochrome b gene.

RESULTS: The analysis of the 1,261 samples revealed that at least six Plasmodium species circulate in great apes in Gabon (Plasmodium praefalciparum, Plasmodium gorA (syn Plasmodium adleri), Plasmodium gorB (syn Plasmodium blacklocki) in gorillas and Plasmodium gaboni, P. reichenowi and Plasmodium billcollinsi in chimpanzees). No new phylogenetic lineages were discovered. The average infection rate was 21.3% for gorillas and 15.4% for chimpanzees. A logistic regression showed that the probability of infection was significantly dependent on the freshness of the droppings but not of the host species or of the average pluviometry of the months of collection."
Handedness for Unimanual Grasping in 564 Great Apes: The Effect on Grip Morphology and a Comparison with Hand Use for a Bimanual Coordinated Task,"['Meguerditchian, A', 'Phillips, KA', 'Chapelain, A', 'Mahovetz, LM', 'Milne, S', 'Stoinski, T', 'Bania, A', 'Lonsdorf, E', 'Schaeffer, J', 'Russell, J', 'Hopkins, WD']",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01794,NOV 23 2015,0,"A number of factors have been proposed to influence within and between species variation in handedness in non-human primates. In the initial study, we assessed the influence of grip morphology on hand use for simple reaching in a sample of 564 great apes including 49 orangutans Pongo pygmaeus, 66 gorillas Gorilla gorilla, 354 chimpanzees Pan troglodytes and 95 bonobos Pan paniscus. Overall, we found a significant right hand bias for reaching. We also found a significant effect of the grip morphology of hand use. Grasping with the thumb and index finger was more prevalent in the right compared to left hand in all four species. There was no significant sex effect on the patterns of handedness. In a subsample of apes, we also compared consistency in hand use for simple reaching with previously published data on a task that measures handedness for bimanual actions. We found that the ratio of subjects with consistent right compared to left hand use was more prevalent in bonobos, chimpanzees and gorillas but not orangutans. However, for all species, the proportion of subjects with inconsistent hand preferences between the tasks was relatively high suggesting some measures may be more sensitive in assessing handedness than others."
Western Lowland Gorilla (Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla) Birth Patterns and Human Presence in Zoological Settings,"['Kurtycz, LMB', 'Ross, SR']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21243,NOV-DEC 2015,0,"There is some evidence to suggest that zoo visitors may have a disruptive impact on zoo-housed animals, especially primates. While some consider western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) to be particularly reactive to large crowds, the evidence of these effects is mixed, and is likely highly influenced by exhibit design, and group composition. While the majority of studies have focused on behavioral responses to human presence, there is the potential for physiological effects as well, including the possibility of affecting the timing of parturition. Such effects have been demonstrated in laboratory-housed callitrichids and chimpanzees, but unlike laboratory settings where human presence is lowest during the weekends, human presence might peak during weekends in public zoo settings. However, in a study of zoo-housed chimpanzees, there were no significant differences between the number of chimpanzee births that occurred on weekdays compared to weekends [Wagner and Ross, 2008], and we sought to test these questions with gorillas. We analyzed the timing of 336 live gorilla births and 48 stillbirths at 53 accredited North American zoos from 1985-2014, and similarly to chimpanzees, found no weekend or weekday effect on number of births (live births: G = 0.000, p = 1; stillbirths: G = 0.166, p < 0.684). These data add to our understanding of the potential influence of human presence on primate behavior and physiology, and add to evidence suggesting that the effects of zoo visitors on exhibited species may be less profound than previously assumed.

Being a victim or an aggressor: Different functions of triadic post-conflict interactions in wolves (Canis lupus lupus),"['Cordoni, G', 'Palagi, E']",AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR,10.1002/ab.21590,NOV-DEC 2015,0,"Animals adopt different behavioral strategies to cope with the conflict of interests coming from the competition over limited resources. Starting from the study on chimpanzees, post-conflict third-party affiliation (the affiliative contact provided by a third-party toward the victimVTAor the aggressorATA) was investigated mainly in primates. Later, this post-conflict mechanism has been demonstrated also in other mammals, such as wallabies, horses, dolphins, domestic dogs, and wolves. Here, we present data on triadic post-conflict affiliation in wolves (Canis lupus lupus) by exploring some of the hypotheses already proposed for primates and never tested before in other social mammals. In this carnivore species, the study of VTA and ATA revealed that these strategies cannot be considered as a unique behavioral category since they differ in many functional aspects. VTA serves to protect the victim by reducing the likelihood of reiterated attacks from the previous aggressor and to reinforce the relationship shared by the third-party and the victim. On the other hand, ATA has a role in bystander protection by limiting the renewed attacks of the previous aggressor toward uninvolved group-members (potential third-parties). In conclusion, exploring VTA and ATA gives the opportunity to concurrently demonstrate some functional differences in triadic post-conflict affiliation according to the different targets of bystanders (victims or aggressors). The data comparison between primates and other social mammals should permit to open new lines of research. Aggr. Behav. 41:526-536, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Comparing humans and nonhuman great apes in the broken cloth problem: Is their knowledge causal or perceptual?,"['Albiach-Serrano, A', 'Sebastian-Enesco, C', 'Seed, A', 'Colmenares, F', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY,10.1016/j.jecp.2015.06.004,NOV 2015,0,"When presented with the broken cloth problem, both human children and nonhuman great apes prefer to pull a continuous cloth over a discontinuous cloth in order to obtain a desired object resting on top. This has been interpreted as evidence that they preferentially attend to the functionally relevant cues of the task (e.g., presence or absence of a gap along the cloth). However, there is controversy regarding whether great apes' behavior is underpinned by causal knowledge, involving abstract concepts (e.g., support, connection), or by perceptual knowledge, based on percepts (e.g., contact, continuity). We presented chimpanzees, orangutans, and 2-, 3-, and 4-year-old children with two versions of the broken cloth problem. The Real condition, made with paper strips, could be solved based on either perceptual cues or causal knowledge. The Painted condition, which looked very similar, could be solved only by attending to perceptual cues. All groups mastered the Real condition, in line with previous results. Older children (3- and 4-year-olds) performed significantly better in this condition than all other groups, but the performance of apes and children did not differ sharply, with 2-year-olds and apes obtaining similar results. In contrast, only 4-year-olds solved the Painted condition. We propose causal knowledge to explain the general good performance of apes and humans in the Real condition compared with the Painted condition. In addition, we suggest that symbolic knowledge might account for 4-year-olds' performance in the Painted condition. Our findings add to the growing literature supporting the idea that learning from arbitrary cues is not a good explanation for the performance of apes and humans on some kinds of physical task.

Social Learning Opportunities in Captive Orangutans (Pongo abelii) and Mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx),"['Bebko, AO', 'Russon, AE']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-015-9870-0,OCT 2015,0,"Social learning is important in the acquisition of many primate behaviors, including food acquisition, object use, and sociality. Social learning opportunities are social situations in which social learning could occur and provide a means of studying influences on social learning in observational research. Species-specific characteristics and individual relationships may influence the importance of social learning opportunities for some behaviors over others. We observed eight captive orangutans (Pongo abelii) and five mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) for > 60 h each at the Toronto Zoo to assess intra- and interspecies differences in social learning opportunities. We measured social learning opportunity quality using spatial proximity because this has been associated with high-quality social learning. Both species had similar captive diets and group structure; therefore observed differences were likely due to species and individual differences, rather than captive environment. We found species differences in the frequency of social learning opportunities, their quality, and the associated type of behavior (food vs. social behavior). Orangutans had more high-quality social learning opportunities relating to food behavior than mandrills, and mandrills had more high-quality social learning opportunities relating to social behavior than orangutans. Both species had more high-quality social learning opportunities in mother-infant vs. other dyads. Our results suggest that learning about food behavior may be more important for orangutans and learning about social behavior may be more important for mandrills. Overall, our results suggest that social learning may be constrained/fostered by differences in frequency and quality of social learning opportunities between species and individuals."
Phylogenomic evidence for recombination of adenoviruses in wild gorillas,"['Hoppe, E', 'Pauly, M', 'Robbins, M', 'Gray, M', 'Kujirakwinja, D', 'Nishuli, R', 'Mungu-Akonkwa, DDB', 'Leendertz, FH', 'Ehlers, B']",JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY,10.1099/jgv.0.000250,SEP 2015,0,"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) of species Human mastadenovirus B (HAdV-B) are genetically highly diverse and comprise several pathogenic types. AdVs closely related to members of HAdV-B infect African great apes and the evolutionary origin of HAdV-B has recently been determined in ancient gorillas. Genetic evidence for intra- and inter-species recombination has been obtained for Ad Vs of humans and captive great apes, but evidence from wild great apes is lacking. In this study, potential HAdV-B members of wild Eastern gorillas were analysed for evidence of recombination. One near-complete genome was amplified from primary sample material and sequenced, and from another six individuals genome fragments were obtained. In phylogenomic analysis, their penton base, pVII-pVI, hexon and fiber genes were compared with those of all publicly available HAdV-B full-genome sequences of humans and captive great apes. Evidence for intra-species recombination between different HAdV-B members of wild gorillas as well as between HAdV-B members of chimpanzees and gorillas was obtained. Since zoonotic Ad Vs have been reported. to cause respiratory outbreaks in both humans and monkeys, and humans in West and Central Africa frequently hunt and butcher primates thereby increasing the chance of zoonotic transmission, such HAdV-B recombinants might widen the pool of potential human pathogens."
Locating Chimpanzee Nests and Identifying Fruiting Trees With an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"['Van Andel, AC', 'Wich, SA', 'Boesch, C', 'Koh, LP', 'Robbins, MM', 'Kelly, J', 'Kuehl, HS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22446,OCT 2015,0,"Monitoring of animal populations is essential for conservation management. Various techniques are available to assess spatiotemporal patterns of species distribution and abundance. Nest surveys are often used for monitoring great apes. Quickly developing technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to complement these ground-based surveys, especially for covering large areas rapidly. Aerial surveys have been used successfully to detect the nests of orang-utans. It is unknown if such an approach is practical for African apes, which usually build their nests at lower heights, where they might be obscured by forest canopy. In this 2-month study, UAV-derived aerial imagery was used for two distinct purposes: testing the detectability of chimpanzee nests and identifying fruiting trees used by chimpanzees in Loango National Park (Gabon). Chimpanzee nest data were collected through two approaches: we located nests on the ground and then tried to detect them in UAV photos and vice versa. Ground surveys were conducted using line transects, reconnaissance trails, and opportunistic sampling during which we detected 116 individual nests in 28 nest groups. In complementary UAV images we detected 48% of the individual nests (68% of nest groups) in open coastal forests and 8% of individual nests (33% of nest groups) in closed canopy inland forests. The key factor for nest detectability in UAV imagery was canopy openness. Data on fruiting trees were collected from five line transects. In 122 UAV images 14 species of trees (N = 433) were identified, alongside 37 tree species (N = 205) in complementary ground surveys. Relative abundance of common tree species correlated between ground and UAV surveys. We conclude that UAVs have great potential as a rapid assessment tool for detecting chimpanzee presence in forest with open canopy and assessing fruit tree availability. UAVs may have limited applicability for nest detection in closed canopy forest. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Mirror self-recognition: a review and critique of attempts to promote and engineer self-recognition in primates,"['Anderson, JR', 'Gallup, GG']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-015-0488-9,OCT 2015,1,"We review research on reactions to mirrors and self-recognition in nonhuman primates, focusing on methodological issues. Starting with the initial demonstration in chimpanzees in 1970 and subsequent attempts to extend this to other species, self-recognition in great apes is discussed with emphasis on spontaneous manifestations of mirror-guided self-exploration as well as spontaneous use of the mirror to investigate foreign marks on otherwise nonvisible body parts-the mark test. Attempts to show self-recognition in other primates are examined with particular reference to the lack of convincing examples of spontaneous mirror-guided self-exploration, and efforts to engineer positive mark test responses by modifying the test or using conditioning techniques. Despite intensive efforts to demonstrate self-recognition in other primates, we conclude that to date there is no compelling evidence that prosimians, monkeys, or lesser apes-gibbons and siamangs-are capable of mirror self-recognition."
Evolutionary Characterization of the Retinitis Pigmentosa GTPase Regulator Gene,"['Raghupathy, RK', 'Gautier, P', 'Soares, DC', 'Wright, AF', 'Shu, XH']",INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE,10.1167/iovs.15-17726,OCT 2015,0,"PURPOSE. The evolutionary conservation of the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) gene was examined across vertebrate and invertebrate lineages to elucidate its function.

METHODS. Orthologous RPGR sequences from vertebrates and invertebrates were selected. Multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic analyses, synteny, and gene structure comparisons were carried out. Expression of the alternatively spliced constitutive (RPGR(const) or RPGR(ex1-19)) and RPGR(ORF15) isoforms was examined in developing and adult zebrafish.

RESULTS. Phylogenetic analyses and syntenic relationships were consistent with the selected sequences being true orthologues, although whole genome duplications in teleost fish resulted in a more complex picture. The splice form RPGR(const) was present in all vertebrate and invertebrate species but the defining carboxyl (C)-terminal exon of RPGR(ORF15) was absent from all invertebrates. The regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1)-like domain adopts a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, which was present in both major splice forms and strongly conserved across evolution. The repetitive acidic region of RPGR(ORF15) showed a high rate of in-frame deletions/insertions across nine primate species, compared with flanking sequences, consistent with an unstable and rapidly evolving region. In zebrafish, RPGR(const) transcripts were most strongly expressed in early development, while the RPGR(ORF15) isoform showed highest expression in adult eye.

CONCLUSIONS. The regulator of chromosome condensation 1-like domain of RPGR was conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates, but RPGR(ORF15) was unique to vertebrates, consistent with a proposed role in the ciliary-based transport of cargoes such as rhodopsin, which is similar to 10 times more abundant in vertebrate than invertebrate photoreceptors. The repetitive acidic region of RPGR(ORF15) shows a rapid rate of evolution, consistent with a mutation ""hot spot."""
The interplay between DNA methylation and sequence divergence in recent human evolution,"['Hernando-Herraez, I', 'Heyn, H', 'Fernandez-Callejo, M', 'Vidal, E', 'Fernandez-Bellon, H', 'Prado-Martinez, J', 'Sharp, AJ', 'Esteller, M', 'Marques-Bonet, T']",NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH,10.1093/nar/gkv693,SEP 30 2015,0,"Despite the increasing knowledge about DNA methylation, the understanding of human epigenome evolution is in its infancy. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing we identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in humans compared to non-human primates and estimated that similar to 25% of these regions were detectable throughout several human tissues. Human DMRs were enriched for specific histone modifications and the majority were located distal to transcription start sites, highlighting the importance of regions outside the direct regulatory context. We also found a significant excess of endogenous retrovirus elements in human-specific hypomethylated.

We reported for the first time a close interplay between inter-species genetic and epigenetic variation in regions of incomplete lineage sorting, transcription factor binding sites and human differentially hypermethylated regions. Specifically, we observed an excess of human-specific substitutions in transcription factor binding sites located within human DMRs, suggesting that alteration of regulatory motifs underlies some human-specific methylation patterns. We also found that the acquisition of DNA hypermethylation in the human lineage is frequently coupled with a rapid evolution at nucleotide level in the neighborhood of these CpG sites. Taken together, our results reveal new insights into the mechanistic basis of human-specific DNA methylation patterns and the interpretation of inter-species non-coding variation."
The role of great apes in seed dispersal of the tropical forest tree species Dacryodes normandii (Burseraceae) in Gabon,"['Haurez, B', 'Dainou, K', 'Tagg, N', 'Petre, CA', 'Doucet, JL']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,10.1017/S0266467415000322,SEP 2015,0,"The identification of seed dispersers and predators is essential to understand the effect of anthropogenic disturbances, and the associated defaunation process, on tropical forest dynamics in Central Africa. In this study, the animals involved in seed predation and dispersal of Dacryodes normandii (Burseraceae), an endozoochorously dispersed tree species endemic to Gabonese forests, were identified in a site in south-east Gabon using two complementary methods: direct observation and camera-trap monitoring of fruit piles. The combined sampling effort (172 h of direct observations and 796 d of camera trapping) led to the identification of six disperser and eight predator species of D. normandii seeds. With high frequency of consumption (88% and 57% of their visits, respectively) and long visit duration (83 and 23 min, respectively), the western lowland gorilla and central chimpanzee were identified as the main dispersers of this species. Seeds passed through the gorilla gut exhibited high germination success (68%). Rodents were identified as predators of D. normandii seeds, potentially displaying rare secondary dispersal through scatter-hoarding. The results of this study highlight the importance of great apes in the seed dispersal of this tree species."
Perception of available space during chimpanzee introductions: Number of accessible areas is more important than enclosure size,"['Herrelko, ES', 'Buchanan-Smith, HM', 'Vick, SJ']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21234,SEP-OCT 2015,0,"Restricting animals to different areas of their enclosure, for both brief and extended durations, is a key element of animal management practices. With such restrictions, available space decreases and the choices the animals can make are more limited, particularly in relation to social dynamics. When unfamiliar individuals are introduced to each other, group dynamics can be unpredictable and understanding space usage is important to facilitate successful introductions. We studied the behavioral, welfare-related responses of two groups of zoo-housed chimpanzees (n=22) as they were introduced to each other and experienced a variety of enclosure restrictions and group composition changes. Our analysis of available space while controlling for chimpanzee density, found that arousal-related scratching and yawning decreased as the number of enclosure areas (separate rooms) available increased, whereas only yawning decreased as the amount of available space (m(2)) increased. Allogrooming, rubbing, and regurgitation/reingestion rates remained constant as both the number of enclosure areas and amount of space changed. Enclosure space is important to zoo-housed chimpanzees, but during introductions, a decrease in arousal-related scratching indicates that the number of accessible areas is more important than the total amount of space available, suggesting that it is important to provide modular enclosures that provide choice and flexible usage, to minimize the welfare impact of short- and long-term husbandry needs.

Intestinal Flora Modification of Arthritis Pattern in Spondyloarthropathy,"['Rothschild, BM']",JCR-JOURNAL OF CLINICAL RHEUMATOLOGY,10.1097/RHU.0000000000000279,SEP 2015,0,"Background The reactive form of spondyloarthropathy appears inducible by exposure to agents of infectious diarrhea, but do those organisms represent the tip of the iceberg, as indicated by renewed interest in gastrointestinal flora? Prevalence of spondyloarthropathy (20% of chimpanzees [Pan] and 28% of gorillas) is independent of subspecies and species, respectively. However, there are major differences in arthritis patterns, a characteristic shared with humans.

Objectives Do patterns of arthritis correlate with gastrointestinal flora? Could such associated modifications be in the form of disease induction or represent protective effectors (at least against the extent of peripheral arthritis)?

Methods The skeletons of 2 chimpanzee subspecies (79 Pan troglodytes troglodytes and 26 Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) and 2 gorilla species (99 Gorilla gorilla and 38 Gorilla beringei) adults were examined, and arthritis pattern noted. Feces of Eastern (P. schweinfurthii and G. beringei) and Western (great apes collected in their normal ranges) apes were assessed for 16S rRNA c and its character.

Results Patterns of arthritis recognized on examination of skeletons showed geographic variation in skeletal distribution. East African apes (P. troglodytes schweinfurthii and G. beringei) had pauciarticular arthritis and frequent sacroiliac disease, whereas West African apes (P. troglodytes troglodytes and G. gorilla) had polyarticular peripheral joint disease with minimal sacroiliac involvement. DNA evidence revealed that Corynebactericeae were prominently represented in great apes with polyarticular disease, whereas Dietzia and Bifidobacterium exposure correlated with reduced peripheral joint arthritis distribution.

Conclusions Suggestions of a protective effect (in this case, limiting extent of peripheral arthritis, but not the disease itself) offered by these organisms are well represented by documented effects in other diseases (eg, tuberculosis) in the zoologic record. Perhaps it is this disease-modifying character that reduces the extent of the peripheral erosive disease, while increasing propensity to axial (sacroiliac) disease. A potential role for probiotic organisms in management of arthritis in humans is suggested, as has been documented for tuberculosis, gastrointestinal disorders, and food allergies."
The Geographic Distribution of Genetic Diversity within Gorillas,"['Funfstuck, T', 'Vigilant, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22427,SEP 2015,1,"Gorillas, like all non-human great apes, are endangered. Understanding the distribution of genetic diversity across their range is important because low diversity may arise in small populations through increased inbreeding, and, by reducing reproductive fitness, may lead to decreased chances of persistence of a given population. Previous studies found higher genetic diversity in the western (Gorilla gorilla) than in the eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei), but rarely employed individuals of known geographic origin to investigate the distribution of diversity across multiple populations. The present study fills that gap by analyzing 1,161 individuals from nine sites across all four currently recognized Gorilla subspecies. Genetic diversity at each site was estimated using published data from seven highly-variable microsatellite loci. We found that the small and fragmented populations of Cross River gorillas, eastern lowland gorillas and mountain gorillas were less diverse than any of the five analyzed western lowland gorilla populations. The higher levels of genetic variation within the western lowland gorillas might be best explained by the facts that they (i) exhibit larger present and past effective population sizes than the other subspecies and (ii) maintain higher rates of gene flow through the existence of largely continuous habitat within their range. With regard to conservation, the high genetic diversity within western lowland gorillas is encouraging and retention of dispersal corridors between already protected areas is essential.

Quantification acuity in spontaneous shoaling decisions of three-spined sticklebacks,"['Mehlis, M', 'Thunken, T', 'Bakker, T', 'Frommen, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-015-0884-y,SEP 2015,1,"The ability to discriminate between different quantities is widespread throughout the animal kingdom, and the underlying mechanisms of quantity discrimination are currently intensely discussed. In contrast, questions elucidating the limits of quantity estimation received rather little attention so far. Here, we examined fine-tuned quantity estimation in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in a natural context, i.e. during shoaling decisions. Wild-caught focal fish were given the spontaneous choice between two shoals which differed in group size by 1 fish (0 vs. 1, 1 vs. 2, 2 vs. 3, 3 vs. 4, 4 vs. 5, 5 vs. 6 and 6 vs. 7), based on visual assessment. The results show that sticklebacks generally prefer to shoal with the larger group. They discriminated numerical contrasts up to 6 versus 7, equalling a numerical ratio of 0.86. Preference patterns followed Weber's law, i.e. decreased with increasing numerical ratio. This pattern was found across all numerical conditions as well as within the small number range (ranging from 1 vs. 2 to 3 vs. 4). The results suggest that wild-caught three-spined sticklebacks are spontaneously able (i.e. without prior learning) to detect subtle differences in shoal sizes. Further, they confirm findings of previous studies highlighting the contribution of the analogue magnitude system to quantity estimation in fishes."
Primates' Socio-Cognitive Abilities: What Kind of Comparisons Makes Sense?,"['Byrnit, JT']",INTEGRATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE,10.1007/s12124-015-9312-8,SEP 2015,0,"Referential gestures are of pivotal importance to the human species. We effortlessly make use of each others' referential gestures to attend to the same things, and our ability to use these gestures show themselves from very early in life. Almost 20 years ago, James Anderson and colleagues presented an experimental paradigm with which to examine the use of referential gestures in non-human primates: the object-choice task. Since then, numerous object-choice studies have been made, not only with primates but also with a range of other animal taxa. Surprisingly, several non-primate species appear to perform better in the object-choice task than primates do. Different hypotheses have been offered to explain the results. Some of these have employed generalizations about primates or subsets of primate taxa that do not take into account the unparalleled diversity that exists between species within the primate order on parameters relevant to the requirements of the object-choice task, such as social structure, feeding ecology, and general morphology. To examine whether these broad primate generalizations offer a fruitful organizing framework within which to interpret the results, a review was made of all published primate results on the use of gazing and glancing cues with species ordered along the primate phylogenetic tree. It was concluded that differences between species may be larger than differences between ancestry taxa, and it is suggested that we need to start rethinking why we are testing animals on experimental paradigms that do not take into account what are the challenges of their natural habitat."
Molecular phylogeny of anoplocephalid tapeworms (Cestoda: Anoplocephalidae) infecting humans and non-human primates,"['Dolezalova, J', 'Vallo, P', 'Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Foitova, I', 'Nurcahyo, W', 'Mudakikwa, A', 'Hashimoto, C', 'Jirku, M', 'Lukes, J', 'Scholz, T', 'Modry, D']",PARASITOLOGY,10.1017/S003118201500058X,SEP 2015,0,"Anoplocephalid tapeworms of the genus Bertiella Stiles and Hassall, 1902 and Anoplocephala Blanchard, 1848, found in the Asian, African and American non-human primates are presumed to sporadic ape-to-man transmissions. Variable nuclear (5.8S-ITS2; 28S rRNA) and mitochondrial genes (cox1; nad1) of isolates of anoplocephalids originating from different primates (Callicebus oenanthe, Gorilla beringei, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes and Pongo abelii) and humans from various regions (South America, Africa, South-East Asia) were sequenced. In most analyses, Bertiella formed a monophyletic group within the subfamily Anoplocephalinae, however, the 28S rRNA sequence-based analysis indicated paraphyletic relationship between Bertiella from primates and Australian marsupials and rodents, which should thus be regarded as different taxa. Moreover, isolate determined as Anoplocephala cf. gorillae from mountain gorilla clustered within the Bertiella clade from primates. This either indicates that A. gorillae deserves to be included into the genus Bertiella, or, that an unknown Bertiella species infects also mountain gorillas. The analyses allowed the genetic differentiation of the isolates, albeit with no obvious geographical or host-related patterns. The unexpected genetic diversity of the isolates studied suggests the existence of several Bertiella species in primates and human and calls for revision of the whole group, based both on molecular and morphological data."
Genetic censusing identifies an unexpectedly sizeable population of an endangered large mammal in a fragmented forest landscape,"['McCarthy, MS', 'Lester, JD', 'Howe, EJ', 'Arandjelovic, M', 'Stanford, CB', 'Vigilant, L']",BMC ECOLOGY,10.1186/s12898-015-0052-x,AUG 25 2015,0,"Background: As habitat degradation and fragmentation continue to impact wildlife populations around the world, it is critical to understand the behavioral flexibility of species in these environments. In Uganda, the mostly unprotected forest fragment landscape between the Budongo and Bugoma Forests is a potential corridor for chimpanzees, yet little is known about the status of chimpanzee populations in these fragments.

Results: From 2011 through 2013, we noninvasively collected 865 chimpanzee fecal samples across 633 km2 and successfully genotyped 662 (77%) at up to 14 microsatellite loci. These genotypes corresponded to 182 chimpanzees, with a mean of 3.5 captures per individual. We obtained population size estimates of 256 (95% confidence interval 246-321) and 319 (288-357) chimpanzees using capture-with-replacement and spatially explicit capture-recapture models, respectively. The spatial clustering of associated genotypes suggests the presence of at least nine communities containing a minimum of 8-33 individuals each. Putative community distributions defined by the locations of associated genotypes correspond well with the distribution of 14 Y-chromosome haplotypes.

Conclusions: These census figures are more than three times greater than a previous estimate based on an extrapolation from small-scale nest count surveys that tend to underestimate population size. The distribution of genotype clusters and Y-chromosome haplotypes together indicate the presence of numerous male philopatric chimpanzee communities throughout the corridor habitat. Our findings demonstrate that, despite extensive habitat loss and fragmentation, chimpanzees remain widely distributed and exhibit distinct community home ranges. Our results further imply that elusive and rare species may adapt to degraded habitats more successfully than previously believed. Their long-term persistence is unlikely, however, if protection is not afforded to them and habitat loss continues unabated."
Electrocardiogram reference intervals for clinically normal wild- born chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Atencia, R', 'Revuelta, L', 'Somauroo, JD', 'Shave, RE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH,NA,AUG 2015,0,"OBJECTIVE

To generate reference intervals for ECG variables in clinically normal chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).

ANIMALS

100 clinically normal (51 young [< 10 years old] and 49 adult [>= 10 years old]) wild-born chimpanzees.

PROCEDURES

Electrocardiograms collected between 2009 and 2013 at the Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Centre were assessed to determine heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QRS axis, P axis, and T axis. Electrocardiographic characteristics for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and morphology of the ST segment, T wave, and QRS complex were identified. Reference intervals for young and old animals were calculated as mean +/- 1.96.SD for normally distributed data and as 5th to 95th percentiles for data not normally distributed. Differences between age groups were assessed by use of unpaired Student t tests.

RESULTS

Reference intervals were generated for young and adult wild-born chimpanzees. Most animals had sinus rhythm with small or normal P wave morphology; 24 of 51 (47%) young chimpanzees and 30 of 49 (61%) adult chimpanzees had evidence of LVH as determined on the basis of criteria for humans.

CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE

Cardiac disease has been implicated as the major cause of death in captive chimpanzees. Species-specific ECG reference intervals for chimpanzees may aid in the diagnosis and treatment of animals with, or at risk of developing, heart disease. Chimpanzees with ECG characteristics outside of these intervals should be considered for follow-up assessment and regular cardiac monitoring."
Western lowland gorilla seed dispersal: Are seeds adapted to long gut retention times?,"['Petre, CA', 'Tagg, N', 'Beudels-Jamar, RC', 'Haurez, B', 'Doucet, JL', 'DEFAUNATION']",ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,10.1016/j.actao.2015.06.003,AUG 2015,0,"The degree of seed scarification in the frugivore gut, partly dependent on gut retention time, is a key component in determining the extent to which gut passage alters germination performances. Another potential benefit of gut passage arises as a result of the removal of fruit pulp which otherwise may act as a germination inhibitor. Using experiments designed to disentangle the respective effects of pulp removal (germination deinhibition) and seed scarification, and gut retention time as an explanatory variable, we investigated the effect of gut passage on germination performances (percentage and latency) of five tropical tree species dispersed by the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla g. gorilla). The percentage of seeds germinating after gut passage increased for three species, respectively, through the effects of scarification only, deinhibition only, and scarification and deinhibition combined. A negative scarification effect was observed for one species, and no effect of gut passage for another. Passage through the gut led to a decrease in germination latency of three species, as a result of the depulping of seeds. However, seed scarification resulted in germination delays for another species. The gut retention time of the five species averaged 39-56 h and had no effect on intra-specific germination performances except for one species whose germination probability increased as gut retention time increased. As gut retention time often correlates with dispersal distance, the fact that gut retention time per se does not reduce seed viability of these tropical tree species may have positive implications for their population dynamics and maintenance of genetic diversity. If no detrimental effect of gut retention time on germination performance is a general trait among tropical species, the extirpation of large frugivores with long gut retention time, such as the western lowland gorilla, would likely have negative long-term implications for tropical forests.

Transposon-mediated death of an ancestral A-23-like allele: evolution of TCR-positioning motifs in the HLA-A lineage,"['Murray, JS']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s00251-015-0852-3,AUG 2015,0,"HLA-A alleles are characterized by tandem arginine and histidine/arginine motifs (i.e., R65 and H151R motifs) present on the alpha 1- and alpha 2-helix, respectively. In crystallographic structures, alpha/beta T-cell receptors (TCR) contact both motifs and appear to be geometrically positioned for alloreactivity. Herein, bioinformatics of ""dual-motif"" MHC A-like alleles were investigated across phylogeny. While A-like alleles with the R65 motif are widespread, the H151R motif has segregated out of most species. Surprisingly, an uncharacterized orf in tarsiers (Loc-103275158) encodes R151 within a truncated A-23-like gene, which is in frame with short footprints of Tc5 and Tigger transposons (TE); the extant tarsier A-23 allele is totally missing exon-3 and part of exon-4; together, suggesting TE-mediated inactivation of an intact/ancestral A-23 allele. Since the only other (non-human) dual-motif A-like alleles are in gorilla, chimpanzee, and the Florida manatee, we speculate that dual-motif A alleles first emerged in the Afrotherian lineage and reappeared during the evolution of higher primates."

The Influence of Seasonal Frugivory on Nutrient and Energy Intake in Wild Western Gorillas,"['Masi, S', 'Mundry, R', 'Ortmann, S', 'Cipolletta, C', 'Boitani, L', 'Robbins, MM']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0129254,JUL 8 2015,0,"The daily energy requirements of animals are determined by a combination of physical and physiological factors, but food availability may challenge the capacity to meet nutritional needs. Western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) are an interesting model for investigating this topic because they are folivore-frugivores that adjust their diet and activities to seasonal variation in fruit availability. Observations of one habituated group of western gorillas in Bai-Hokou, Central African Republic (December 2004-December 2005) were used to examine seasonal variation in diet quality and nutritional intake. We tested if during the high fruit season the food consumed by western gorillas was higher in quality (higher in energy, sugar, fat but lower in fibre and antifeedants) than during the low fruit season. Food consumed during the high fruit season was higher in digestible energy, but not any other macronutrients. Second, we investigated whether the gorillas increased their daily intake of carbohydrates, metabolizable energy (KCal/g OM), or other nutrients during the high fruit season. Intake of dry matter, fibers, fat, protein and the majority of minerals and phenols decreased with increased frugivory and there was some indication of seasonal variation in intake of energy (KCal/g OM), tannins, protein/fiber ratio, and iron. Intake of non-structural carbohydrates and sugars was not influenced by fruit availability. Gorillas are probably able to extract large quantities of energy via fermentation since they rely on proteinaceous leaves during the low fruit season. Macronutrients and micronutrients, but not digestible energy, may be limited for them during times of low fruit availability because they are hind-gut fermenters. We discuss the advantages of seasonal frugivores having large dietary breath and flexibility, significant characteristics to consider in the conservation strategies of endangered species."
"HIV-1 Group O Origin, Evolution, Pathogenesis, and Treatment: Unraveling the Complexity of an Outlier 25 Years Later","['Bush, S', 'Tebit, DM']",AIDS REVIEWS,NA,JUL-SEP 2015,0,"Twenty-five years ago, an aberrant HIV-1 (now classified as HIV-1 group O) was described from a Cameroonian HIV patient living in Belgium. The epicenter of group O was later found to be in Central Africa, overlapping with the geographical location of the central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), the likely original hosts of group a Although the prevalence of group O has remained low at 1-2% in Cameroon, some European countries (France, Spain, Belgium) with strong colonial ties to Central Africa have reported the highest prevalence out of Africa. The sequence diversity between HIV-1 group O and M strains is huge, reaching 50 and 30% in the envelope and pol, respectively. This diversity has hindered diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of group O-infected patients. Due to the intrinsic presence of the C181 mutation in group O, more than 60% of the approximately 30,000 individuals that live with this virus are faced with the challenge of drug resistance to some currently used antiretroviral therapies, notably the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Despite its susceptibility to most antiretroviral therapies, some group Os show a high variable baseline susceptibility to enfuvirtide (T20) and maraviroc. Group O strains are the least fit among all HIV-1 and -2 and restrict tetherin using their Nef but not Vpu as reported for group M. Although limited follow-up studies indicate that the natural course of group O is similar to that of M, these viruses are dominantly CCR5 tropic even late in infection, suggesting slow disease progression. This review summarizes important findings that marked the discovery, origin, spread, evolution, pathogenesis, and treatment of group O within the last 25 years."
The effects of group type and young silverbacks on wounding rates in western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) groups in North American zoos,"['Leeds, A', 'Boyer, D', 'Ross, SR', 'Lukas, KE']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21218,JUL-AUG 2015,0,"In North American zoos, male gorillas are often housed in all-male (bachelor) groups to provide socialization for males not managed in breeding groups. These groups exhibit long-term cohesion and stability and males in bachelor groups are no more aggressive than males in mixed-sex groups. Previous studies have shown that aggression in male gorillas is more directly related to age rather than group type, with young silverbacks (YSB; males 14-20 years of age) having higher rates of aggressive behavior than males of other age classes. Despite this, anecdotal reports have persisted that bachelor groups have higher wounding rates than mixed-sex groups. To assess wounding in zoo-housed gorillas, all instances of wounding across 28 zoos (180 gorillas, 45 social groups) were recorded over a 26 months period via a standardized data sheet. Similar to previous reports, we found age to be an important determinant in wounding. Bachelor groups that contained YSB's had significantly more wounds than bachelor groups without YSB's (U=14.0, z=-2.193, P=0.029). There was no difference in wounding rates between mixed-sex and bachelor groups without YSB's (U=69.5, z=-0.411, P=0.689). These data further demonstrate the importance of behavioral management of YSB's in zoos and the viability of bachelor groups as a long-term housing solution for male gorillas.

Social inhibitory control in five lemur species,"['Reddy, RB', 'MacLean, EL', 'Sandel, AA', 'Hare, B']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-015-0467-1,JUL 2015,0,"We tested five lemur species-ring-tailed lemurs, ruffed lemurs, mongoose lemurs, black lemurs, and Coquerel's sifakas-(N = 52) in an experiment that evaluated skills for inhibitory control in a social context. First, two human experimenters presented identical food rewards; the ""generous"" experimenter allowed the subject to eat from her hand, whereas the ""competitive"" experimenter always withheld the reward. Lemurs quickly learned to approach the generous experimenter and avoid the competitive one. In the inhibition test phase, we endowed the competitive experimenter with a more valuable food reward but the competitive experimenter continued to withhold food from the subject. Thus, lemurs were required to inhibit approaching the more desirable reward in favor of the lesser but obtainable reward presented by the generous experimenter. In test trials, lemurs' tendency to approach the competitive experimenter increased from the reputation phase, demonstrating sensitivity to the experimental manipulation. However, subjects approached the larger reward less frequently in test trials compared with pretest food-preference trials, evidencing some capacity for inhibitory control in this context. Despite differences in sociality and ecology, the five lemur species did not differ in this ability. Although the study did not uncover species differences, this experimental task may provide a useful measure of social inhibition in broader comparative studies."
Intentional gestural communication and discrimination of human attentional states in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta),"['Canteloup, C', 'Bovet, D', 'Meunier, H']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-015-0856-2,JUL 2015,0,"The present study tested intentionality of a learned begging gesture and attention-reading abilities in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Subjects were trained to produce a begging gesture towards a hidden food reward that could be delivered by a human experimenter. More specifically, we investigated which attentional cues-body, face and/or eyes orientation of a human partner-were taken into account by the macaques in order to communicate with her. Our results provide strong evidence of intentional communication: the monkeys adjusted their behaviour to that of the partner. The latter's attentional state influenced the monkeys' likelihood of performing begging gestures and showing gaze alternation between the partner and the hidden food. By contrast, we found no evidence of attention-getting behaviours, persistence or elaboration of new communicative behaviours. Our results also showed that rhesus macaques discriminated gross cues including the presence, body and face orientation of the human experimenter but not her eyes. However, the monkeys emitted more gaze alternation and monitored the human's attentional state more closely when she also displayed gaze alternation, suggesting an important role of joint attention in gestural communication."

Faecal biomarkers are proving to be a valuable tool in identifying relative proportions of plant and animal tissues in Palaeolithic diets. A limiting factor in the application of the faecal biomarker approach is the striking absence of data related to the occurrence of faecal biomarkers in non-human primate faeces. In this study we explored the nature and proportions of sterols and stanols excreted by our closest living relatives. This investigation reports the first faecal biomarker data for wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei). Our results suggest that the chemometric analysis of faecal biomarkers is a useful tool for distinguishing between NHP and human faecal matter, and hence, it could provide information for palaeodietary research and early human diets."
Infanticide as Sexual Conflict: Coevolution of Male Strategies and Female Counterstrategies,"['Palombit, RA']",COLD SPRING HARBOR PERSPECTIVES IN BIOLOGY,10.1101/cshperspect.a017640,JUN 2015,1,"One of the earliest recognized forms of sexual conflict was infanticide by males, which imposes serious costs on female reproductive success. Here I review two bodies of evidence addressing coevolved strategies of males and females. The original sexual selection hypothesis arguing that infanticide improves male mating success by accelerating the return of females to fertilizable condition has been generally supported in some taxa-notably, some primates, carnivores, rodents, and cetaceans-but not in other taxa. One result of recent research has been to implicate other selective benefits of infanticide by males in various taxa from insects to birds to mammals, such as acquisition of breeding status or improvement of the female breeding condition. In some cases, however, the adaptive significance of male infanticide remains obscure. The second body of data I review is arguably the most important result of recent research: clarifying the possible female counterstrategies to infanticide. These potential counterstrategies span diverse biological systems, ranging from sexual behavior (e.g., polyandrous mating), to physiology (e.g., the Bruce effect), to individual behavior (e.g., maternal aggression), to social strategies (e.g., association with coalitionary defenders of either sex). Although much remains to be studied, these current data provide compelling evidence of sexually antagonistic coevolution surrounding the phenomenon of infanticide."
The role of character displacement in the molarization of hominin mandibular premolars,"['Schroer, K', 'Wood, B']",EVOLUTION,10.1111/evo.12672,JUN 2015,1,"Closely related species are likely to experience resource competition in areas where their ranges overlap. Fossil evidence suggests that hominins in East Africa c. 2-1.5 million years ago may have lived synchronically and sympatrically, and that competition may have contributed to the different tooth sizes observed in Homo and Paranthropus. To assess the likelihood that these taxa overlapped, we applied a character displacement model to the postcanine tooth size of fossil hominins and validated this model in populations of living primates. Mandibular fourth premolar (P-4) crown size was measured from fossil taxa and from living primate species where dietary overlap is established. Dimensions of the P-4 crown were fitted to a character matrix and described as the response variables of a generalized linear model that took taxon and location as input variables. The model recovered significant divergence in samples of closely related, living primates. When applied to fossil hominins the same model detected strong indications of character displacement between early Homo and Paranthropus (P = 0.002) on the basis of their P-4 crown size. Our study is an example of how ecologically informed morphologies measured in appropriate extant referents can provide a comparative context for assessing community and ecological evolution in the fossil record."
Effect of preservation method on spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) fecal microbiota over 8 weeks,"['Hale, VL', 'Tan, CL', 'Knight, R', 'Amato, KR']",JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS,10.1016/j.mimet.2015.03.021,JUN 2015,1,"Studies of the gut microbiome have become increasingly common with recent technological advances. Gut microbes play an important role in human and animal Health, and gut microbiome analysis holds great potential for evaluating health in wildlife, as microbiota can be assessed from non-invasively collected fecal samples. However, many common fecal preservation protocols (e.g. freezing at -80 degrees C) are not suitable for field conditions, or have not been tested for long-term (greater than 2 weeks) storage. In this study, we collected fresh fecal samples from captive spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) at the Columbian Park Zoo (Lafayette, IN, USA). The samples were pooled, homogenized, and preserved for up to 8 weeks prior to DNA extraction and sequencing. Preservation methods included: freezing at -20 degrees C, freezing at -80 degrees C, immersion in 100% ethanol, application to FTA cards, and immersion in RNAlater. At 0 (fresh), 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks from fecal collection, DNA was extracted and microbial DNA was amplified and sequenced. DNA concentration, purity, microbial diversity, and microbial composition were compared across all methods and time points. DNA concentration and purity did not correlate with microbial diversity or composition. Microbial composition of frozen and ethanol samples were most similar to fresh samples. FTA card and RNAlater-preserved samples had the least similar microbial composition and abundance compared to fresh samples. Microbial composition and diversity were relatively stable over time within each preservation method. Based on these results, if freezers are not available, we recommend preserving fecal samples in ethanol (for up to 8 weeks) prior to microbial extraction and analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Habitat use of bonobos (Pan paniscus) at Wamba: Selection of vegetation types for ranging, feeding, and night-sleeping","['Terada, S', 'Nackoney, J', 'Sakamaki, T', 'Mulavwa, MN', 'Yumoto, T', 'Furuichi, T']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22392,JUN 2015,1,"Understanding the habitat requirements of great apes is essential for effective conservation strategies. We examined annual habitat use of a bonobo group in the Wamba field site within the Luo Scientific Reserve, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Using satellite imagery, we categorized the group's ranging area into three forest types: (1) primary and old secondary forest (P/OS), (2) young secondary forest and agriculture (YS/Ag), and (3) swamp forest (Sw). We tracked the group for 1 year (2007-2008) and compared usage of the three forest types for ranging, feeding, and night-sleeping. We also recorded what the bonobos ate and monitored monthly fruit availability in each forest type. The group ranged and fed more often in P/OS and less often in YS/Ag and Sw than expected based on habitat availability. Also, the group slept mostly in P/OS (94% of nights monitored), but also in YS/Ag (1%), and Sw (5%). Fruit availability in P/OS had no significant effect on habitat selection, but the group fed in YS/Ag most often during the two months when fruits in P/OS were least abundant. In June, when fruit of Uapaca spp. (selectively eaten by bonobos) was generally abundant in Sw, the group mostly ranged and slept there. The bonobos fed most often on herbaceous plants in all three forest types. In Sw, the bonobos frequently ate mushrooms. Our results show that semi-open forest with abundant herbaceous plants such as YS/Ag could be an important feeding habitat and may provide fallback food for bonobos when fruits are scarce. Furthermore, Sw can serve seasonally as a main habitat to complement P/OS if adequate food resources and tree nesting opportunities are available. We conclude that bonobos use diverse habitats depending on their needs and we highlight the importance of minor-use habitats for sustaining populations of target species in conservation planning. Am.

"Modeling variation in early life mortality in the western lowland gorilla: Genetic, maternal and other effects","['Ahsan, MH', 'Blomquist, GE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22389,JUN 2015,0,"Uncovering sources of variation in gorilla infant mortality informs conservation and life history research efforts. The international studbook for the western lowland gorilla provides information on a sample of captive gorillas large enough for which to analyze genetic, maternal, and various other effects on early life mortality in this critically endangered species. We assess the importance of variables such as sex, maternal parity, paternal age, and hand rearing with regard to infant survival. We also quantify the proportions of variation in mortality influenced by heritable variation and maternal effects from these pedigree and survival data using variance component estimation. Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of generalized linear mixed models produce variance component distributions in an animal model framework that employs all pedigree information. Two models, one with a maternal identity component and one with both additive genetic and maternal identity components, estimate variance components for different age classes during the first 2 years of life. This is informative of the extent to which mortality risk factors change over time during gorilla infancy. Our results indicate that gorilla mortality is moderately heritable with the strongest genetic influence just after birth. Maternal effects are most important during the first 6 months of life. Interestingly, hand-reared infants have lower mortality for the first 6 months of life. Aside from hand rearing, we found other predictors commonly used in studies of primate infant mortality to have little influence in these gorilla data. Am. J. Primatol. 77:666-678, 2015.

Little is known about the ecology of these pathogens in gorillas. A total of 131 gorilla fecal samples were collected from Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas to study the diversity and prevalence of Plasmodium species. The effects of sex and age as factors influencing levels of infection with Plasmodium in habituated gorilla groups were assessed. Ninety-five human blood samples from the same locality were also analysed to test for cross-transmission between humans and gorillas. According to a cytB PCR assay 32% of gorilla's fecal samples and 43.1% human individuals were infected with Plasmodium spp. All Laverania species, Plasmodium vivax, and for the first time Plasmodium ovale were identified from gorilla samples. Plasmodium praefalciparum was present only from habituated individuals and P. falciparum was detected from human samples. Although few P. vivax and P. ovale sequences were obtained from gorillas, the evidence for cross-species transmission between humans and gorillas requires more in depth analysis. No association was found between malaria infection and sex, however, younger individuals aged 6 years were more susceptible. Switching between two different Plasmodium spp. was observed in three individuals. Prolonged monitoring of Plasmodium infection during various seasons and recording behavioural data is necessary to draw a precise picture about the infection dynamics."
Odor signals in wild western lowland gorillas: an involuntary and extra-group communication hypothesis,"['Masi, S', 'Bouret, S']",PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR,10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.03.022,JUN 1 2015,2,"Odors constitute one of the most ancient ways of communication among animals. Whereas the key role of olfactory communication is well established in insects or rodents, its contribution to primate behavior remains very speculative. In a recent report, Klailova and Lee [1] studied the variations of intensity of the typical steroid musk odor produced by wild adult male gorilla silverbacks during encounters with opponents from other social units (lone males or other groups). The odor intensity increased in situations of potential conflicts, when the silverback encountered another male gorilla, which constitutes a potential threat for his infants and mate competitor for his females. Importantly, the odor intensity was greater when the silverback reacted with a demonstrative threat display, and milder when he decided to react quietly and avoid the conflict by sneaking away. According to the authors, this indicates that silverback gorillas can flexibly adjust the odor signal to the social context and the mild signal associated with the quiet response is used within the silverback's group to promote cohesion. Rather, based on both physiological and behavioral data, we propose that (1) the odor intensity varies monotonically with arousal, across all situations, and (2) that the function of the odor signal is most relevant for the interactions between males of different groups. In such framework, the odor stimulus might also constitute a non-visual signal indicator of the emitter's identity, and therefore play a role in the regulation of the interactions with other gorillas. Establishing the balance among those potential functions is critical to understand the role of odors in the regulation of social and ecological interactions in primates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Advancing Behavior Analysis in Zoos and Aquariums,"['Maple, TL', 'Segura, VD']",BEHAVIOR ANALYST,10.1007/s40614-014-0018-x,MAY 2015,0,"Zoos, aquariums, and other captive animal facilities offer promising opportunities to advance the science and practice of behavior analysis. Zoos and aquariums are necessarily concerned with the health and well-being of their charges and are held to a high standard by their supporters (visitors, members, and donors), organized critics, and the media. Zoos and aquariums offer unique venues for teaching and research and a locus for expanding the footprint of behavior analysis. In North America, Europe, and the UK, formal agreements between zoos, aquariums, and university graduate departments have been operating successfully for decades. To expand on this model, it will be necessary to help zoo and aquarium managers throughout the world to recognize the value of behavior analysis in the delivery of essential animal health and welfare services. Academic institutions, administrators, and invested faculty should consider the utility of training students to meet the growing needs of applied behavior analysis in zoos and aquariums and other animal facilities such as primate research centers, sanctuaries, and rescue centers."
"Do bimanual coordination, tool use, and body posture contribute equally to hand preferences in bonobos?","['Bardo, A', 'Pouydebat, E', 'Meunier, H']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.02.015,MAY 2015,1,"Approximately 90% of the human population is right-handed. The emergence of this hand preference in humans is thought to be linked to the ability to execute complex tasks and habitual bipedalism. In order to test these hypotheses, the present study explored, for the first time, hand preference in relation to both body posture (seated and bipedal) and task complexity (bimanual coordination and two tool use tasks of different complexity) in bonobos (Pan paniscus). Few studies have explored the effects of both posture and task complexity on handedness, and investigations with bonobos are scarce, particularly studies on tool use. Our study aims to overcome such a gap by addressing two main questions: 1) Does a bipedal posture increase the strength of hand preference and/or create a directional bias to the use of the right hand? 2) Independent of body posture, does task complexity increase the strength of the hand preference and/or create a directional bias to the use of the right hand? Our results show that independent of body posture, the more complex the task, the more lateralization occurred. Moreover, subjects tended to be right-handed for tasks involving tool use. However, posture had no significant effect on hand preference in the tasks tested here. Therefore, for a given task, bonobos were not more lateralized in a bipedal posture than in a seated one. Task complexity might thus have contributed more than bipedal posture to the emergence of human lateralization and the preponderance of right-handedness, although a larger sample size and more data are needed to be conclusive.

The potential of Social Network Analysis as a tool for the management of zoo animals,"['Rose, PE', 'Croft, DP']",ANIMAL WELFARE,10.7120/09627286.24.2.123,MAY 2015,0,"Social Network Analysis (SNA) enables the fine scale of animal sociality and population structure to be quantified. SNA is widely applied to questions relating to behavioural ecology but has seen little use in the application to zoo animal management, despite its clear potential. Investment in social bonds between individuals positively affects health status, welfare state, long-term fitness and lifetime reproductive output. Such positive affective states can be maintained consistently within captive situations if more information is known about the social preferences of the individuals that are kept. Disruption to social bonds may lead to impoverished welfare and stress to individuals which have seen their social support compromised. The patterning of social relationships between individuals also influences how space is utilised and how animals interact with resources provided for them. With more detailed knowledge of the social structure of a group or population, social groupings (for example, for captive breeding) can be specifically designed to minimise social stress. Likewise, enhancing the chances of successful reproduction can be achieved if we understand the role that each individual within a network plays and how these roles may impact on the behaviour of others. This paper discusses key aspects of SNA applicable to zoo-based researchers wishing to investigate the social lives of zoo animals. We present a review of how SNA can be used to assess social behaviour and highlight directions for future research. Our aim is to stimulate new research to ultimately improve our understanding of reproductive success, decision-making, group leadership, animal health and enclosure use. We conclude that what can be learned about the dynamics of social zoo-housed species using SNA can directly impact on husbandry decisions and help underpin excellent standards of animal welfare."
"The use of nonhuman primates in research on seasonal, pandemic and avian influenza, 1893-2014","['Davis, AS', 'Taubenberger, JK', 'Bray, M']",ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH,10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.02.011,MAY 2015,3,"Attempts to reproduce the features of human influenza in laboratory animals date from the early 1890s, when Richard Pfeiffer inoculated apes with bacteria recovered from influenza patients and produced a mild respiratory illness. Numerous studies employing nonhuman primates (NHPs) were performed during the 1918 pandemic and the following decade. Most used bacterial preparations to infect animals, but some sought a filterable agent for the disease. Since the viral etiology of influenza was established in the early 1930s, studies in NHPs have been supplemented by a much larger number of experiments in mice, ferrets and human volunteers. However, the emergence of a novel swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus in 1976 and the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in 1997 stimulated an increase in NHP research, because these agents are difficult to study in naturally infected patients and cannot be administered to human volunteers. In this paper, we review the published literature on the use of NHPs in influenza research from 1893 through the end of 2014. The first section summarizes observational studies of naturally occurring influenza-like syndromes in wild and captive primates, including serologic investigations. The second provides a chronological account of experimental infections of NHPs, beginning with Pfeiffer's study and covering all published research on seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, including vaccine and antiviral drug testing. The third section reviews experimental infections of NHPs with avian influenza viruses that have caused disease in humans since 1997. The paper concludes with suggestions for further studies to more clearly define and optimize the role of NHPs as experimental animals for influenza research. Published by Elsevier B.V."

To investigate the gut microbiome of wild primates and determine how these microbial communities respond to the host's external environment, we characterized faecal bacterial communities and, for the first time, gut metabolomes of four wild lowland gorilla groups in the Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic. Results show that geographical range may be an important modulator of the gut microbiomes and metabolomes of these gorilla groups. Distinctions seemed to relate to feeding behaviour, implying energy harvest through increased fruit consumption or fermentation of highly fibrous foods. These observations were supported by differential abundance of metabolites and bacterial taxa associated with the metabolism of cellulose, phenolics, organic acids, simple sugars, lipids and sterols between gorillas occupying different geographical ranges. Additionally, the gut microbiomes of a gorilla group under increased anthropogenic pressure could always be distinguished from that of all other groups. By characterizing the interplay between environment, behaviour, diet and symbiotic gut microbes, we present an alternative perspective on primate ecology and on the forces that shape the gut microbiomes of wild primates from an evolutionary context."
Quantity and spatial distribution of seeds dispersed by a western lowland gorilla population in south-east Cameroon,"['Petre, CA', 'Tagg, N', 'Beudels-Jamar, R', 'Haurez, B', 'Salah, M', 'Spetschinsky, V', 'Willie, J', 'Doucet, JL']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,10.1017/S0266467415000073,MAY 2015,4,"Understanding the ecological function of large frugivores in tropical forests is important considering their central position in seed-dispersal networks. This study illustrates the seed-dispersal effectiveness of a western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) population in Cameroon by looking at the interaction of seed quantity, species regeneration traits and the environmental characteristics of the deposition sites (sleeping sites vs. feeding trails) in order to discuss the role of gorillas within the ecosystem. The analysis of 1030 faecal samples collected over a 3-y period (September 2009-August 2012) showed that gorillas dispersed a diverse array of species (58 spp. identified), with an average of 289 intact seeds (>5 mm) d(-1) per individual. Seed damage during mouth and gut processing occurred for 12 spp., generally accounting for <5% of specific seed load. Germination trials suggested that germination success of passed seeds remained unchanged (N = 6 spp.) or improved (N = 5 spp.) after gut passage compared with hand-cleaned seeds, with one exception. Indicator species identification (IndVal method) and General Discriminant Analysis suggested that sleeping sites (N = 36), as a main type of seed deposition site, correspond to regenerating microhabitats and correspondingly degree of canopy openness is one variable discriminating significantly this type of deposition site with random locations in the forest (N = 36) used as a proxy for non-directed seed deposition on feeding trails. With a mean canopy openness of 19-27%, sleeping sites offer optimal light conditions for the seedling recruitment of non-pioneer light-demanding species, the seeds of which encompass 47.4% of the total seed load dispersed over the 3-y period. From this study, it is hypothesized that the gorilla performed directed-dispersal of some light-demanding plant species at sleeping sites, and hence, by being actively implicated in gap-phase dynamics, fulfils a valuable ecological function within its ecosystem."
Admixture Between Historically Isolated Mitochondrial Lineages in Captive Western Gorillas: Recommendations for Future Management,"['Soto-Calderon, ID', 'Dew, JL', 'Bergl, RA', 'Jensen-Seaman, MI', 'Anthony, NM']",JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,10.1093/jhered/esv006,MAY-JUN 2015,0,"Although captive populations of western gorilla have been maintained in the United States for over a century, little is known about the geographic origins and genetic composition of the current zoo population. Furthermore, although previous mitochondrial analyses have shown that free-range gorilla populations exhibit substantial regional differentiation, nothing is known of the extent to which this variation has been preserved in captive populations. To address these questions, we combined 379 pedigree records with data from 52 mitochondrial sequences to infer individual haplogroup affiliations, geographical origin of wild founders and instances of inter-breeding between haplogroups in the United States captive gorilla population. We show that the current captive population contains all major mitochondrial lineages found within wild western lowland gorillas. Levels of haplotype diversity are also comparable to those found in wild populations. However, the majority of captive gorilla matings have occurred between individuals with different haplogroup affiliations. Although restricting crosses to individuals within the same haplogroup would preserve the phylogeographic structure present in the wild, careful management of captive populations is required to minimize the risk of drift and inbreeding. However, when captive animals are released back into the wild, we recommend that efforts should be made to preserve natural phylogeographic structure."
Domestic pigs' (Sus scrofa domestica) use of direct and indirect visual and auditory cues in an object choice task,"['Nawroth, C', 'von Borell, E']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-015-0842-8,MAY 2015,0,"Recently, foraging strategies have been linked to the ability to use indirect visual information. More selective feeders should express a higher aversion against losses compared to non-selective feeders and should therefore be more prone to avoid empty food locations. To extend these findings, in this study, we present a series of studies investigating the use of direct and indirect visual and auditory information by an omnivorous but selective feeder-the domestic pig. Subjects had to choose between two buckets, with only one containing a reward. Before making a choice, the subjects in Experiment 1 (N = 8) received full information regarding both the baited and non-baited location, either in a visual or auditory domain. In this experiment, the subjects were able to use visual but not auditory cues to infer the location of the reward spontaneously. Additionally, four individuals learned to use auditory cues after a period of training. In Experiment 2 (N = 8), the pigs were given different amounts of visual information about the content of the buckets-lifting either both of the buckets (full information), the baited bucket (direct information), the empty bucket (indirect information) or no bucket at all (no information). The subjects as a group were able to use direct and indirect visual cues. However, over the course of the experiment, the performance dropped to chance level when indirect information was provided. A final experiment (N = 3) provided preliminary results for pigs' use of indirect auditory information to infer the location of a reward. We conclude that pigs at a very young age are able to make decisions based on indirect information in the visual domain, whereas their performance in the use of indirect auditory information warrants further investigation."

We found that the two eastern subspecies have experienced a prolonged population decline over the past 100,000 years, resulting in very low genetic diversity and an increased overall burden of deleterious variation. A further recent decline in the mountain gorilla population has led to extensive inbreeding, such that individuals are typically homozygous at 34% of their sequence, leading to the purging of severely deleterious recessive mutations from the population. We discuss the causes of their decline and the consequences for their future survival."
Toward a Biology of Collectivism: Reducing the East West Divide to Its Physical and Physiological Substrates,"['Hertler, SC']",SAGE OPEN,10.1177/2158244015590161,APR-JUN 2015,0,"The signs of mating competition are written into the physiology of the human male, but they are not written equally into the physiology of all racial groupings of human males. It seems that Asian males are different, different in that they are more fully dissimilar from the gorilla than are other races, showing less sexual dimorphism, muscularity, and less marked secondary sexual characteristics, and different in that they are more fully dissimilar from the chimpanzee than are other races, showing less sexual drive and activity as well as smaller testicles and lower sperm counts. It is presently argued that such anatomical differences are a testament to a more peaceably monogamous mating history. In turn, it is then argued that such physiological markers are directly associated with the collectivist ethos that has been historically, anthropologically, and sociologically observed among the Asian people."
Assessment of Infections with Microsporidia and Cryptosporidium spp. in Fecal Samples from Wild Primate Populations from Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo,"['Butel, C', 'Mundeke, SA', 'Drakulovski, P', 'Krasteva, D', 'Ngole, EM', 'Mallie, M', 'Delaporte, E', 'Peeters, M', 'Locatelli, S']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-015-9820-x,APR 2015,0,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infects many primate species. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) can develop an immune disease similar to human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Immunosuppressed patients often suffer from opportunistic diseases such as microsporidiosis and cryptosporidiosis. We report on the occurrence of infections with microsporidia and Cryptosporidium spp. in wild-living chimpanzees, gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), bonobos (Pan paniscus), and four monkey species from the Cercopithecinae subfamily (Cercocebus agilis, Cercopithecus cephus, Cercopithecus nictitans, and Lophocebus albigena) and assess whether these infections may be good indicators of SIV-related immunosuppression. We analyzed 399 fecal samples collected in Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo for the presence of cross-reactive HIV antibodies using a line immunoassay (INNO-LIAA (R)). We amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) a 200-500 bp DNA fragment for the genus Encephalitozoon and the genus Enterocytozoon respectively (microsporidia), and an 820 bp DNA fragment of various Cryptosporidium species. Twenty-nine percent (45/155) of the chimpanzees samples analyzed were SIV+, whereas samples from the other primate species were SIV-. Phylogenetic analyses showed that 11 fecal samples [one SIV+, four SIV- chimpanzees, three gorillas, a bonobo, an agile mangabey (Cercocebus agilis), and a moustached monkey (Cercopithecus cephus)] are infected with microsporidia. DNA sequences of amplicons derived from eight fecal samples clustered together with Encephalitozoon hellem and three branched close to E. intestinalis. We also amplified Cryptosporidium spp. in two SIV+ chimpanzee samples and in two gorilla samples. We found no significant association between SIV infection status in chimpanzees and the presence of microsporidia or Cryptosporidium, suggesting that detection of microsporidia and Cryptosporidium is not a reliable marker for immunosuppressive status in SIV-infected primates."
Age-dependent cognitive inflexibility in great apes,"['Manrique, HM', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.01.002,APR 2015,1,"The ability to suppress and/or change behaviour on the basis of negative feedback, often conceptualized as cognitive flexibility, has rarely been investigated in nonhuman great apes across a broad age range. In this study, 25 chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, eight bonobos, Pan paniscus, seven orang-utans, Pongo abelii, and three gorillas, Gorilla gorilla, whose ages ranged from 5 to 48 years, were presented with a transparent Plexiglas rectangular box horizontally attached to their cage mesh. A square container, 7.5 cm(2), fixed inside the apparatus contained a food reward (i.e. a grape). While the container rested on its central position the grape was not accessible. To retrieve the grape the subjects needed to grasp the handle connected to the reward container and displace it sideways to reach one of the lateral access windows. Subjects were intensively trained to displace the handle to a specific side (right or left, depending on the group) and then the rewarded side was reversed during the test. Performance in this reversal task did not differ significantly between species. However, a U-shaped relation between age and perseverative responding (i.e. moves to the previously rewarded side) was observed, extending findings with humans to our closest living primate relatives.

Orangutans modify facial displays depending on recipient attention,"['Waller, BM', 'Caeiro, CC', 'Davila-Ross, M']",PEERJ,10.7717/peerj.827,MAR 19 2015,1,"Primate facial expressions are widely accepted as underpinned by reflexive emotional processes and not under voluntary control. In contrast, other modes of primate communication, especially gestures, are widely accepted as underpinned by intentional, goal-driven cognitive processes. One reason for this distinction is that production of primate gestures is often sensitive to the attentional state of the recipient, a phenomenon used as one of the key behavioural criteria for identifying intentionality in signal production. The reasoning is that modifying/producing a signal when a potential recipient is looking could demonstrate that the sender intends to communicate with them. Here, we show that the production of a primate facial expression can also be sensitive to the attention of the play partner. Using the orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) Facial Action Coding System(OrangFACS), we demonstrate that facial movements are more intense and more complex when recipient attention is directed towards the sender. Therefore, production of the playface is not an automated response to play (or simply a play behaviour itself) and is instead produced flexibly depending on the context. If sensitivity to attentional stance is a good indicator of intentionality, we must also conclude that the orangutan playface is intentionally produced. However, a number of alternative, lower level interpretations for flexible production of signals in response to the attention of another are discussed. As intentionality is a key feature of human language, claims of intentional communication in related primate species are powerful drivers in language evolution debates, and thus caution in identifying intentionality is important."
Origin of the HIV-1 group O epidemic in western lowland gorillas,"[""D'arc, M"", 'Ayouba, A', 'Esteban, A', 'Learn, GH', 'Boue, V', 'Liegeois, F', 'Etienne, L', 'Tagg, N', 'Leendertz, FH', 'Boesch, C', 'Madinda, NF', 'Robbins, MM', 'Gray, M', 'Cournil, A', 'Ooms, M', 'Letko, M', 'Simon, VA', 'Sharp, PM', 'Hahn, BH', 'Delaporte, E', 'Ngole, EM', 'Peeters, M']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1502022112,MAR 17 2015,12,"HIV-1, the cause of AIDS, is composed of four phylogenetic lineages, groups M, N, O, and P, each of which resulted from an independent cross-species transmission event of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting African apes. Although groups M and N have been traced to geographically distinct chimpanzee communities in southern Cameroon, the reservoirs of groups O and P remain unknown. Here, we screened fecal samples fromwestern lowland (n = 2,611), eastern lowland (n = 103), and mountain (n = 218) gorillas for gorilla SIV (SIVgor) antibodies and nucleic acids. Despite testing wild troops throughout southern Cameroon (n = 14), northern Gabon (n = 16), the Democratic Republic of Congo (n = 2), and Uganda (n = 1), SIVgor was identified at only four sites in southern Cameroon, with prevalences ranging from 0.8-22%. Amplification of partial and full-length SIVgor sequences revealed extensive genetic diversity, but all SIVgor strains were derived from a single lineage within the chimpanzee SIV (SIVcpz) radiation. Two fully sequenced gorilla viruses from southwestern Cameroon were very closely related to, and likely represent the source population of, HIV-1 group P. Most of the genome of a third SIVgor strain, from central Cameroon, was very closely related to HIV-1 group O, again pointing to gorillas as the immediate source. Functional analyses identified the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G as a barrier for chimpanzee-to-gorilla, but not gorilla-to-human, virus transmission. These data indicate that HIV-1 group O, which spreads epidemically in west central Africa and is estimated to have infected around 100,000 people, originated by cross-species transmission from western lowland gorillas."
Diversity of malaria parasites in great apes in Gabon,"['Boundenga, L', 'Ollomo, B', 'Rougeron, V', 'Mouele, LY', 'Mve-Ondo, B', 'Delicat-Loembet, LM', 'Moukodoum, ND', 'Okouga, AP', 'Arnathau, C', 'Elguero, E', 'Durand, P', 'Liegeois, F', 'Boue, V', 'Motsch, P', 'Le Flohic, G', 'Ndoungouet, A', 'Paupy, C', 'Ba, CT', 'Renaud, F', 'Prugnolle, F']",MALARIA JOURNAL,10.1186/s12936-015-0622-6,MAR 14 2015,2,"Background: Until 2009, the Laverania subgenus counted only two representatives: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium reichenowi. The recent development of non-invasive methods allowed re-exploration of plasmodial diversity in African apes. Although a large number of great ape populations have now been studied regarding Plasmodium infections in Africa, there are still vast areas of their distribution that remained unexplored. Gabon constitutes an important part of the range of western central African great ape subspecies (Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla), but has not been studied so far. In the present study, the diversity of Plasmodium species circulating in great apes in Gabon was analysed.

Methods: The analysis of 1,261 faecal samples from 791 chimpanzees and 470 gorillas collected from 24 sites all over Gabon was performed. Plasmodium infections were characterized by amplification and sequencing of a portion of the Plasmodium cytochrome b gene.

Results: The analysis of the 1,261 samples revealed that at least six Plasmodium species circulate in great apes in Gabon (Plasmodium praefalciparum, Plasmodium gorA (syn Plasmodium adleri), Plasmodium gorB (syn Plasmodium blacklocki) in gorillas and Plasmodium gaboni, P. reichenowi and Plasmodium billcollinsi in chimpanzees). No new phylogenetic lineages were discovered. The average infection rate was 21.3% for gorillas and 15.4% for chimpanzees. A logistic regression showed that the probability of infection was significantly dependent on the freshness of the droppings but not of the host species or of the average pluviometry of the months of collection."

Here, we examined whether HIV-1-specific bNabs are capable of cross-neutralizing distantly related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting central (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) (SIVcpzPtt) and eastern (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) (SIVcpzPts) chimpanzees (n = 11) as well as western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) (SIVgor) (n = 1). We found that bNabs directed against the CD4 binding site (n = 10), peptidoglycans at the base of variable loop 3 (V3) (n = 5), and epitopes at the interface of surface (gp120) and membrane-bound (gp41) envelope glycoproteins (n = 5) failed to neutralize SIVcpz and SIVgor strains. In addition, apex V2-directed bNabs (n = 3) as well as llama-derived (heavy chain only) antibodies (n = 6) recognizing both the CD4 binding site and gp41 epitopes were either completely inactive or neutralized only a fraction of SIVcpzPtt strains. In contrast, one antibody targeting the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of gp41 (10E8), functional CD4 and CCR5 receptor mimetics (eCD4-Ig, eCD4-Ig(mim2), CD4-218.3-E51, and CD4-218.3-E51-mim2), as well as mono-and bispecific anti-human CD4 (iMab and LM52) and CCR5 (PRO140, PRO140-10E8) receptor antibodies neutralized >90% of SIVcpz and SIVgor strains with low-nanomolar (0.13 to 8.4 nM) potency. Importantly, the latter antibodies blocked virus entry not only in TZM-bl cells but also in Cf2Th cells expressing chimpanzee CD4 and CCR5 and neutralized SIVcpz in chimpanzee CD4(+) T cells, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) ranging from 3.6 to 40.5 nM. These findings provide new insight into the protective capacity of anti-HIV-1 bNabs and identify candidates for further development to combat SIVcpz infection.

IMPORTANCE SIVcpz is widespread in wild-living chimpanzees and can cause AIDS-like immunopathology and clinical disease. HIV-1 infection of humans can be controlled by antiretroviral therapy; however, treatment of wild-living African apes with current drug regimens is not feasible. Nonetheless, it may be possible to curb the spread of SIVcpz in select ape communities using vectored immunoprophylaxis and/or therapy. Here, we show that antibodies and antibody-like inhibitors developed to combat HIV-1 infection in humans are capable of neutralizing genetically diverse SIVcpz and SIVgor strains with considerable breadth and potency, including in primary chimpanzee CD4(+) T cells. These reagents provide an important first step toward translating intervention strategies currently developed to treat and prevent AIDS in humans to SIV-infected apes."
Differences in dung beetle activity at western gorilla defecation sites in south-east Cameroon: implications for establishment of Uapaca spp. seedlings,"['Petre, CA', 'Zinque, MH', 'Tagg, N', 'Beudels-Jamar, RC', 'Haurez, B', 'Josso, JF', 'Moretto, P', 'Doucet, JL']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,10.1017/S0266467414000753,MAR 2015,2,"For endozoochorous seed dispersal systems, the extant dung beetle assemblage at seed deposition sites may influence site suitability as burial activity may change the probability that seeds germinate and seedlings establish. This study tested if the different conditions of the two main seed-deposition habitats of a western lowland gorilla population of south-east Cameroon (sleeping sites and old secondary forest) influenced dung beetle assemblages and consequently the seed relocation patterns. In March 2012, in both habitats, burial patterns (proportion and depth) were described in eight stations based on two 300-g experimental faeces with known number of Uapaca spp. seeds (N = 75) left for 48 h, and beetle assemblages were described based on one 48h-dung-baited pitfall trapping session in five of these stations. To assess the impact of burial pattern on seedling emergence, Uapaca seedling emergence trials were performed in a nursery (75 seeds per depth treatment). Assemblage at sleeping sites had a higher species richness (non-significant) and was significantly more abundant than in old secondary forests. Conversely, significantly more seeds were buried in old secondary forests than sleeping sites and at significantly greater depths (mean: 14.9 cm vs. 8.7 cm). As trials suggested that burial depth >= 7 cm prevented Uapaca seedling emergence, dung beetles are assumed to induce seed loss more strongly in old secondary forests than sleeping sites (20.5% vs. 6.7% of initial seed crop). The demonstration that dung beetles may exert a negative influence on seed fate overall, and that the degree to which this occurs may vary depending on habitat, highlights the complexity in determining the suitability of deposition sites for recruitment."
How much more would KNM-WT 15000 have grown?,"['Ruff, CB', 'Burgess, ML']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.09.005,MAR 2015,3,"Because of its completeness, the juvenile Homo ergaster/erectus KNM-WT 15000 has played an important role in studies of the evolution of body form in Homo. Early attempts to estimate his adult body size used modern human growth models. However, more recent evidence, particularly from the dentition, suggests that he may have had a more chimpanzee-like growth trajectory. Here we re-estimate his adult stature and body mass using ontogenetic data derived from four African ape taxa: Pan troglodytes troglodytes, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, Pan paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla gorilla. The average percentage change in femoral and tibial lengths and femoral head breadth between individuals at the same stage of dental development as KNM-WT 15000 - eruption of M2s but not M3s and adult individuals with fully fused long bone epiphyses, was determined. Results were then applied to KNM-WT 15000, and his adult size estimated from skeletal dimensions using modem human prediction formulae. Using this approach, adult stature best estimates of 176-180 cm and body mass best estimates of 80-83 kg were obtained. These estimates are close to those estimated directly from longitudinal changes in body length and body mass between 8 and 12 years of age in chimpanzees, the suggested chronological equivalent to KNM-WT 15000's remaining growth period. Thus, even using an African ape growth model, it is likely that KNM-WT 15000 would have attained close to 180 cm in stature (without a slight reduction for his lower cranial height) and 80 kg in body mass as an adult. Other evidence from the East African Early Pleistocene indicates that KNM-WT 15000 was not unusually large-bodied for his time period. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Rotator cuff muscle size and the interpretation of scapular shape in primates,"['Larson, SG']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.01.001,MAR 2015,3,"Scapular shape variation among primates is widely viewed as being strongly related to locomotor differences. The relative importance of overhead forelimb elevation in the locomotor repertoire of a species, as reflected in muscular leverage for scapular rotation or in the sizes of attachment areas for muscles involved in glenohumeral elevation, has proven to be a useful organizing principle for understanding this variation. While generally successful in sorting primate scapulae into functional groups, the scapulae of some species do not entirely match predictions based on the perceived importance of forelimb elevation. A recent study has shown that scapular fossa sizes in apes are not as accurate predictors of the sizes of the muscles arising from them as has been assumed. To further explore the degree of correspondence between actual and predicted muscle size based on the perceived importance of forelimb elevation, the current study examines the relative sizes of the rotator cuff muscles in a wider sample of primate taxa using published data on muscle mass and cross-sectional area. The results do not support some of the accepted generalizations about the relative sizes of members of the rotator cuff based on measurements of the sizes of scapular fossae. For example, orthograde apes do not display enlarged supraspinatus muscles compared to pronograde monkeys. Differences in assessments of relative muscle size based on mass compared to those based on cross-sectional area suggest that poor correspondence between muscle size predicted from scapular fossa size and actual muscle size may be related to constraints on scapular form associated with muscular leverage for scapular rotation and with scapular position on the thorax.

Examination of genomic variation within great apes offers many opportunities to increase our understanding of the forces that have differentially shaped the evolutionary history of hominid taxa. Here, we expand upon the work of the Great Ape Genome Project by analyzing medium to high coverage whole-genome sequences from 14 western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), 2 eastern lowland gorillas (G. beringei graueri), and a single Cross River individual (G. gorilla diehli). We infer that the ancestors of western and eastern lowland gorillas diverged from a common ancestor approximately 261 ka, and that the ancestors of the Cross River population diverged from the western lowland gorilla lineage approximately 68 ka. Using a diffusion approximation approach to model the genome-wide site frequency spectrum, we infer a history of western lowland gorillas that includes an ancestral population expansion of 1.4-fold around 970 ka and a recent 5.6-fold contraction in population size 23 ka. The latter may correspond to a major reduction in African equatorial forests around the Last Glacial Maximum. We also analyze patterns of variation among western lowland gorillas to identify several genomic regions with strong signatures of recent selective sweeps. We find that processes related to taste, pancreatic and saliva secretion, sodium ion transmembrane transport, and cardiac muscle function are overrepresented in genomic regions predicted to have experienced recent positive selection."

Task-specific modulation of adult humans' tool preferences: number of choices and size of the problem,"['Silva, KM', 'Gross, TJ', 'Silva, FJ']",LEARNING & BEHAVIOR,10.3758/s13420-014-0160-z,MAR 2015,0,"In two experiments, we examined the effect of modifications to the features of a stick-and-tube problem on the stick lengths that adult humans used to solve the problem. In Experiment 1, we examined whether people's tool preferences for retrieving an out-of-reach object in a tube might more closely resemble those reported with laboratory crows if people could modify a single stick to an ideal length to solve the problem. Contrary to when adult humans have selected a tool from a set of ten sticks, asking people to modify a single stick to retrieve an object did not generally result in a stick whose length was related to the object's distance. Consistent with the prior research, though, the working length of the stick was related to the object's distance. In Experiment 2, we examined the effect of increasing the scale of the stick-and-tube problem on people's tool preferences. Increasing the scale of the task influenced people to select relatively shorter tools than had selected in previous studies. Although the causal structures of the tasks used in the two experiments were identical, their results were not. This underscores the necessity of studying physical cognition in relation to a particular causal structure by using a variety of tasks and methods."
Relationship between amino acid usage and amino acid evolution in primates,"['Liu, HX', 'Xie, ZQ', 'Tan, SJ', 'Zhang, XH', 'Yang, SH']",GENE,10.1016/j.gene.2014.12.033,FEB 25 2015,1,"Amino acid usage varies from species to species. A previous study has found a universal trend in amino acid gain and loss in many taxa and a one-way model of amino acid evolution in which the number of new amino acids increases as the number of old amino acids decreases was proposed. Later studies showed that this pattern of amino acid gain and loss is likely to be compatible with the neutral theory. The present work aimed to further study this problem by investigating the evolutionary patterns of amino acids in 8 primates (the nucleotide and protein alignments are available online http://gattaca.nju.edu.cn/pub_data.html). First, the number of amino acids gained and lost was calculated and the evolution trend of each amino acid was inferred. These values were found to be closely related to the usage of each amino acid. Then we analyzed the mutational trend of amino acid substitution in human using SNPs, this trend is highly correlated with fixation trend only with greater variance. Finally, the trends in the evolution of 20 amino adds were evaluated in human on different time scales, and the increasing rate of 5 significantly increasing amino acids was found to decrease as a function of time elapsed since divergence, and the dS/dN ratio also found to increase as a function of time elapsed since divergence. These results suggested that the observed amino acid substitution pattern is influenced by mutation and purifying selection. In conclusion, the present study shows that usage of amino acids is an important factor capable of influencing the observed pattern of amino acid evolution, and also presented evidences suggesting that the observed universal trend of amino acid gain and loss is compatible with neutral evolution.

Detection dog efficacy for collecting faecal samples from the critically endangered Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli) for genetic censusing.,"['Arandjelovic, Mimi', 'Bergl, Richard A', 'Ikfuingei, Romanus', 'Jameson, Christopher', 'Parker, Megan', 'Vigilant, Linda']",Royal Society open science,10.1098/rsos.140423,2015-Feb,0,"Population estimates using genetic capture-recapture methods from non-invasively collected wildlife samples are more accurate and precise than those obtained from traditional methods when detection and resampling rates are high. Recently, detection dogs have been increasingly used to find elusive species and their by-products. Here we compared the effectiveness of dog- and human-directed searches for Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli) faeces at two sites. The critically endangered Cross River gorilla inhabits a region of high biodiversity and endemism on the border between Nigeria and Cameroon. The rugged highland terrain and their cryptic behaviour make them difficult to study and a precise population size for the subspecies is still lacking. Dog-directed surveys located more fresh faeces with less bias than human-directed survey teams. This produced a more reliable population estimate, although of modest precision given the small scale of this pilot study. Unfortunately, the considerable costs associated with use of the United States-based detection dog teams make the use of these teams financially unfeasible for a larger, more comprehensive survey. To realize the full potential of dog-directed surveys and increase cost-effectiveness, we recommend basing dog-detection teams in the countries where they will operate and expanding the targets the dogs are trained to detect."

Despite their early A beta buildup, ape brains have not shown evidence dystrophic neurites near plaques. Aging great ape brains also have few neurofibrillary tangles, with one exception of 1 obese chimpanzee euthanized after a stroke who displayed abundant neurofibrillary tangles, but without the typical AD distribution. We discuss the need for more exacting evaluation of neuron density with age, and note husbandry issues that may allow great apes to live to greater ages.

Lack of Correlation Between Fluctuating Asymmetry and Morphological Masculinity/Femininity in Primate Skulls,"['Van Dongen, S']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-015-9814-8,FEB 2015,1,"As both degree of masculinity/femininity in sexually dimorphic organisms and developmental instability are put forward as indicators of individual quality, they are expected to correlate positively. However, the results in the literature are equivocal. One reason may be that most research has been performed in populations exposed to relatively low levels of parasitism. This article studies associations between the degree of masculinity/femininity and the fluctuating asymmetry (a measure of developmental instability) of skulls of three primate species [baboon (Papio anubis), eastern lowland gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri), and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes)] collected in the wild. The exposure to infection and parasites is likely to be higher in these individuals compared to captive primates and humans, and therefore likely to increase the levels of association. While the degree of individual masculinity/femininity and levels of fluctuating asymmetry were quantified accurately, I found no evidence of an association between them. My results thus are in line with the conclusion of a recent meta-analysis, that there is little evidence for associations between masculinity/femininity and developmental instability."

Few studies have examined the ecology and epidemiology of this pathogen in rural tropical systems characterized by high rates of overlap among humans, domesticated animals, and wildlife. We investigated risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection and assessed cross-species transmission potential among people, non-human primates, and domestic animals in the Gombe Ecosystem, Kigoma District, Tanzania. A cross-sectional survey was designed to determine the occurrence and risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection in humans, domestic animals and wildlife living in and around Gombe National Park. Diagnostic PCR revealed Cryptosporidium infection rates of 4.3% in humans, 16.0% in non-human primates, and 9.6% in livestock. Local streams sampled were negative. DNA sequencing uncovered a complex epidemiology for Cryptosporidium in this system, with humans, baboons and a subset of chimpanzees infected with C. hominis subtype IfA12G2; another subset of chimpanzees infected with C. suis; and all positive goats and sheep infected with C. xiaoi. For humans, residence location was associated with increased risk of infection in Mwamgongo village compared to one camp ( Kasekela), and there was an increased odds for infection when living in a household with another positive person. Fecal consistency and other gastrointestinal signs did not predict Cryptosporidium infection. Despite a high degree of habitat overlap between village people and livestock, our results suggest that there are distinct Cryptosporidium transmission dynamics for humans and livestock in this system. The dominance of C. hominis subtype IfA12G2 among humans and non-human primates suggest cross-species transmission. Interestingly, a subset of chimpanzees was infected with C. suis. We hypothesize that there is cross-species transmission from bush pigs (Potaochoerus larvatus) to chimpanzees in Gombe forest, since domesticated pigs are regionally absent. Our findings demonstrate a complex nature of Cryptosporidium in sympatric primates, including humans, and stress the need for further studies."
"Nonhuman Primate Communication, Pragmatics, and the Origins of Language","['Scott-Phillips, TC']",CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1086/679674,FEB 2015,2,"Comparisons with the cognition and communication of other species have long informed discussions of the origins and evolution of human communication and language. This research has often focused on similarities and differences with the linguistic code, but more recently there has been an increased focus on the social-cognitive foundations of linguistic communication. However, exactly what these comparisons tell us is not clear because the theoretical concepts used in the animal communication literature are different from those used in the corresponding literature on human communication, specifically those used in linguistic pragmatics. In this article, I bridge the gap between these two areas and in doing so specify exactly what great ape communication tells us about the origins of human communication and language. I conclude that great ape communication probably does not share the same social-cognitive foundations as linguistic communication but that it probably does involve the use of metacognitive abilities that, once they evolved to a more sophisticated degree, were exapted for use in what is an evolutionarily novel form of communication: human ostensive communication. This in turn laid the foundations for the emergence of linguistic communication. More generally, I highlight the often-neglected importance of pragmatics for the study of language origins."

Because those SIV infections that are pathogenic have been shown to induce changes in the host's gut microbiome, monitoring the microbiota present in faecal samples can provide a noninvasive means for studying the effects of SIV infection on the health of wild-living primates. Here, we examine the effects of SIVgor, a close relative of SIVcpz of chimpanzees and HIV-1 of humans, on the gut bacterial communities residing within wild gorillas, revealing that gorilla gut microbiomes are exceptionally robust to SIV infection. In contrast to the microbiomes of HIV-1-infected humans and SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees, SIVgor-infected gorilla microbiomes exhibit neither rises in the frequencies of opportunistic pathogens nor elevated rates of microbial turnover within individual hosts. Regardless of SIV infection status, gorilla microbiomes assort into enterotypes, one of which is compositionally analogous to those identified in humans and chimpanzees. The other gorilla enterotype appears specialized for a leaf-based diet and is enriched in environmentally derived bacterial genera. We hypothesize that the acquisition of this gorilla-specific enterotype was enabled by lowered immune system control over the composition of the microbiome. Our results indicate differences between the pathology of SIVgor and SIVcpz/HIV-1 infections, demonstrating the utility of investigating host microbial ecology as a means for studying disease in wild primates of high conservation priority."

Stereologic methods were used to measure volumes of brain structures, including left and right frontal lobe gray and white matter, temporal lobe gray and white matter, parietal and occipital lobes gray and white matter, insular gray matter, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, each hemisphere and the vermis of the cerebellum, and the external and extreme capsules together with the claustrum. Among the species differences, the volumes of the hippocampus and cerebellum were significantly larger in G. gorilla than G. beringei. These anatomical differences may relate to divergent ecological adaptations of the two species. Specifically, G. gorilla engages in more arboreal locomotion and thus may rely more on cerebellar circuits. In addition, they tend to eat more fruit and have larger home ranges and consequently might depend more on spatial mapping functions of the hippocampus. Am J Phys Anthropol 156:252-262, 2015.

Sexual selection and the adaptive evolution of PKDREJ protein in primates and rodents,"['Vicens, A', 'Montoto, LG', 'Couso-Ferrer, F', 'Sutton, KA', 'Roldan, ERS']",MOLECULAR HUMAN REPRODUCTION,10.1093/molehr/gau095,FEB 2015,0,"PKDREJ is a testis-specific protein thought to be located on the sperm surface. Functional studies in the mouse revealed that loss of PKDREJ has effects on sperm transport and the ability to undergo an induced acrosome reaction. Thus, PKDREJ has been considered a potential target of post-copulatory sexual selection in the form of sperm competition. Proteins involved in reproductive processes often show accelerated evolution. In many cases, this rapid divergence is promoted by positive selection which may be driven, at least in part, by post-copulatory sexual selection. We analysed the evolution of the PKDREJ protein in primates and rodents and assessed whether PKDREJ divergence is associated with testes mass relative to body mass, which is a reliable proxy of sperm competition levels. Evidence of an association between the evolutionary rate of the PKDREJ gene and testes mass relative to body mass was not found in primates. Among rodents, evidence of positive selection was detected in the Pkdrej gene in the family Cricetidae but not in Muridae. We then assessed whether Pkdrej divergence is associated with episodes of sperm competition in these families. We detected a positive significant correlation between the evolutionary rates of Pkdrej and testes mass relative to body mass in cricetids. These findings constitute the first evidence of post-copulatory sexual selection influencing the evolution of a protein that participates in the mechanisms regulating sperm transport and the acrosome reaction, strongly suggesting that positive selection may act on these fertilization steps, leading to advantages in situations of sperm competition."
Origin of HTLV-1 in Hunters of Nonhuman Primates in Central Africa,"['Kazanji, M', 'Mouinga-Ondeme, A', 'Lekana-Douki-Etenna, S', 'Caron, M', 'Makuwa, M', 'Mahieux, R', 'Gessain, A']",JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES,10.1093/infdis/jiu464,FEB 1 2015,2,"Of 78 Gabonese individuals who had received bites from nonhuman primates (NHPs) while hunting, 7 were infected with human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1). Five had been bitten by gorillas and were infected with subtype B strains; however, a 12-year-old girl who was severely bitten by a Cercopithecus nictitans was infected with a subtype D strain that was closely related to the simian T lymphotropic virus (STLV-1) that infects this monkey species. Her mother was infected with a subtype B strain. These data confirm that hunters in Africa can be infected by HTLV-1 that is closely related to the strains circulating among local NHP game. Our findings strongly suggest that a severe bite represent a risk factor for STLV-1 acquisition."
Identification of human-specific AluS elements through comparative genomics,"['Lee, J', 'Kim, YJ', 'Mun, S', 'Kim, HS', 'Han, K']",GENE,10.1016/j.gene.2014.11.005,JAN 25 2015,0,"Mobile elements are responsible for similar to 45% of the human genome. Among them is the Alu element, accounting for 10% of the human genome (>1.1 million copies). Several studies of Alu elements have reported that they are frequently involved in human genetic diseases and genomic rearrangements. In this study, we investigated the AluS subfamily, which is a relatively old Alu subfamily and has the highest copy number in primate genomes. Previously, a set of 263 human-specific AluS insertions was identified in the human genome. To validate these, we compared each of the human-specific AluS loci with its pre-insertion site in other primate genomes, including chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. We obtained 24 putative human-specific AluS candidates via the in silico analysis and manual inspection, and then tried to verify them using PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Through the PCR product sequencing, we were able to detect two instances of near-parallel Alu insertions in nearby sites that led to computational false negatives. Finally, we computationally and experimentally verified 23 human-specific AluS elements. We reported three alternative Abu insertion events, which are accompanied by filler DNA and/or Alu retrotransposition mediated-deletion. Bisulfite sequencing was carried out to examine DNA methylation levels of human-specific AluS elements. The results showed that fixed AluS elements are hypermethylated compared with polymorphic elements, indicating a possible relation between DNA methylation and Abu fixation in the human genome.

Wild Gorillas as a Potential Reservoir of Leishmania major,"['Hamad, I', 'Forestier, CL', 'Peeters, M', 'Delaporte, E', 'Raoult, D', 'Bittar, F']",JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES,10.1093/infdis/jiu380,JAN 15 2015,2,"Vector-borne parasites of the genus Leishmania are responsible for severe human diseases. Cutaneous leishmaniasis, a common form of the disease, is most often caused by the transmission of Leishmania major to humans by female phlebotomine sand flies. Apes are increasingly being seen as a source of zoonotic diseases, including malaria and rickettsiosis. To examine whether gorillas harbor Leishmania species, we screened fecal samples from wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Cameroon for the presence of these pathogens. Of 91 wild gorilla fecal samples, 12 contained Leishmania parasites, and 4 contained phlebotomine sand fly vectors. The molecular identity was determined by running 3 different polymerase chain reaction tests for detection of L. major. Next, fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to visualize L. major parasites in fecal samples from the gorillas. Both promastigote and amastigote forms of the parasite were found. This work strongly suggests that wild gorillas carry pathogenic Leishmania parasites."
The socio-matrix reloaded: from hierarchy to dominance profile in wild lemurs,"['Norscia, I', 'Palagi, E', 'PROPITHECUS-VERREAUXI']",PEERJ,10.7717/peerj.729,JAN 15 2015,2,"Dominance hierarchy influences the life quality of social animals, and its definition should in principle be based on the outcome of agonistic interactions. However, defining and comparing the dominance profile of social groups is difficult due to the different dominance measures used and because no one measure explains it all. We applied different analytical methods to winner-loser sociomatrices to determine the dominance profile of five groups of wild lemurs (species: Lemur catta, Propithecus verreauxi, and Eulemur rufus x collaris) from the Berenty forest (Madagascar). They are an excellent study model because they share the same habitat and an apparently similar dominance profile: linear hierarchy and female dominance. Data were collected over more than 1200 h of observation. Our approach included four steps: (1) by applying the binary dyadic dominance relationship method (I&SI) on either aggressions or supplant sociomatrices we verified whether hierarchy was aggression or submission based; (2) by calculating normalized David's scores and measuring steepness from aggression sociomatrices we evaluated whether hierarchy was shallow or steep; (3) by comparing the ranking orders obtained with methods 1 and 2 we assessed whether hierarchy was consistent or not; and (4) by assessing triangle transitivity and comparing it with the linearity index and the level of group cohesion we determined if hierarchy was more or less cohesive. Our results show that L. catta groups have got a steep, consistent, highly transitive and cohesive hierarchy. P. verreauxi groups are characterized by a moderately steep and consistent hierarchy, with variable levels of triangle transitivity and cohesion. E. rufus x collaris group possesses a shallow and inconsistent hierarchy, with lower (but not lowest) levels of transitivity and cohesion. A multiple analytical approach on winner-loser sociomatrices other than leading to an in-depth description of the dominance profile, allows intergroup and cross-species comparisons."

"Cooperation in primates A critical, methodological review","['Albiach-Serrano, A']",INTERACTION STUDIES,10.1075/is.16.3.02alb,2015,0,"Observational studies have suggested that some nonhuman primates' cooperative behavior may rely on their capacity to share goals and understand the role of their partners. Experimental studies have tried to find evidence for this under controlled conditions, investigating aspects like the degree of organization in different primate species and the individuals' capacity to recognize and choose good partners, switch roles with them, and care about their outcomes. Often, the results have been mixed. Partly, this is because of the methodological difficulties inherent to empirical research. In this paper, I offer a critical, methodological review of the experimental studies done in the last years on nonhuman primates' cooperation, I discuss their findings, and suggest possible solutions to some of the procedural problems. Hopefully, this will contribute to improve the design of future studies and therefore our knowledge about the evolutionary history of cooperation."

Is the western lowland gorilla a good gardener? Evidence for directed dispersal in Southeast Gabon,"['Haurez, B', 'Brostaux, Y', 'Petre, CA', 'Doucet, JL']",BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES,NA,2015,0,"In Central African tropical forests, the western lowland gorilla deposits most of the seeds it disperses in well-lit nesting sites that can favour seedling growth. The faecal matrix surrounding the seeds can act as a fertiliser and further enhance seedling development. This fertilisation effect had never been tested. Our research therefore aimed to determine whether seed deposition by gorillas (i) in faecal matter and (ii) in nest sites is advantageous for seedling development (growth rate and foliation rate) and survival (% of surviving seedlings). To assess the effect of the faecal matrix, seeds of Santiria trimera (Burseraceae), Chrysophyllum lacourtianum (Sapotaceae) and Plagiostyles africana (Euphorbiaceae) collected from gorilla faeces were sown in a nursery with and without a faecal matrix. Seedlings of Santiria trimera and Dactyodes normandii (Burseraceae) were established in nest sites and in closed canopy terra firme forest sites to assess the impact of seed deposition on seedling development and survival. The faecal matrix was observed to positively influence seedling development in the species studied, but showed no effect on survival. Regarding seed deposition sites, the development rates observed were two to ten times higher in the nest sites than in closed-canopy forest. This enhanced seedling development was positively correlated with canopy openness. In situ studies of seed germination, seedling growth and survival are needed to characterise the fate of gorilla-dispersed seeds more precisely. However, our results offer evidence that gorillas provide important directed dispersal services by depositing seeds most frequently in open canopy sites."

Genetic evidence for contribution of human dispersal to the genetic diversity of EBA-175 in Plasmodium falciparum,"['Yasukochi, Y', 'Naka, I', 'Patarapotikul, J', 'Hananantachai, H', 'Ohashi, J']",MALARIA JOURNAL,10.1186/s12936-015-0820-2,AUG 1 2015,0,"Background: The 175-kDa erythrocyte binding antigen (EBA-175) of Plasmodium falciparum plays a crucial role in merozoite invasion into human erythrocytes. EBA-175 is believed to have been under diversifying selection; however, there have been no studies investigating the effect of dispersal of humans out of Africa on the genetic variation of EBA-175 in P. falciparum.

Methods: The PCR-direct sequencing was performed for a part of the eba-175 gene (regions II and III) using DNA samples obtained from Thai patients infected with P. falciparum. The divergence times for the P. falciparum eba-175 alleles were estimated assuming that P. falciparum/Plasmodium reichenowi divergence occurred 6 million years ago (MYA). To examine the possibility of diversifying selection, nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates for Plasmodium species were also estimated.

Results: A total of 32 eba-175 alleles were identified from 131 Thai P. falciparum isolates. Their estimated divergence time was 0.13-0.14 MYA, before the exodus of humans from Africa. A phylogenetic tree for a large sequence dataset of P. falciparum eba-175 alleles from across the world showed the presence of a basal Asian-specific cluster for all P. falciparum sequences. A markedly more nonsynonymous substitutions than synonymous substitutions in region II in P. falciparum was also detected, but not within Plasmodium species parasitizing African apes, suggesting that diversifying selection has acted specifically on P. falciparum eba-175.

Conclusions: Plasmodium falciparum eba-175 genetic diversity appeared to increase following the exodus of Asian ancestors from Africa. Diversifying selection may have played an important role in the diversification of eba-175 allelic lineages. The present results suggest that the dispersals of humans out of Africa influenced significantly the molecular evolution of P. falciparum EBA-175."
How Ebola impacts social dynamics in gorillas: a multistate modelling approach,"['Genton, C', 'Pierre, A', 'Cristescu, R', 'Levrero, F', 'Gatti, S', 'Pierre, JS', 'Menard, N', 'Le Gouar, P']",JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,10.1111/1365-2656.12268,JAN 2015,2,"Emerging infectious diseases can induce rapid changes in population dynamics and threaten population persistence. In socially structured populations, the transfers of individuals between social units, for example, from breeding groups to non-breeding groups, shape population dynamics. We suggest that diseases may affect these crucial transfers.

We aimed to determine how disturbance by an emerging disease affects demographic rates of gorillas, especially transfer rates within populations and immigration rates into populations.

We compared social dynamics and key demographic parameters in a gorilla population affected by Ebola using a long-term observation data set including pre-, during and post-outbreak periods. We also studied a population of undetermined epidemiological status in order to assess whether this population was affected by the disease. We developed a multistate model that can handle transition between social units while optimizing the number of states.

During the Ebola outbreak, social dynamics displayed increased transfers from a breeding to a non-breeding status for both males and females. Six years after the outbreak, demographic and most of social dynamics parameters had returned to their initial rates, suggesting a certain resilience in the response to disruption. The formation of breeding groups increased just after Ebola, indicating that environmental conditions were still attractive. However, population recovery was likely delayed because compensatory immigration was probably impeded by the potential impact of Ebola in the surrounding areas. The population of undetermined epidemiological status behaved similarly to the other population before Ebola.

Our results highlight the need to integrate social dynamics in host-population demographic models to better understand the role of social structure in the sensitivity and the response to disease disturbances."
Neutralization properties of simian immunodeficiency viruses infecting chimpanzees and gorillas.,"['Barbian, Hannah J', 'Decker, Julie M', 'Bibollet-Ruche, Frederic', 'Galimidi, Rachel P', 'West, Anthony P Jr', 'Learn, Gerald H', 'Parrish, Nicholas F', 'Iyer, Shilpa S', 'Li, Yingying', 'Pace, Craig S', 'Song, Ruijiang', 'Huang, Yaoxing', 'Denny, Thomas N', 'Mouquet, Hugo', 'Martin, Loic', 'Acharya, Priyamvada', 'Zhang, Baoshan', 'Kwong, Peter D', 'Mascola, John R', 'Verrips, C Theo', 'Strokappe, Nika M', 'Rutten, Lucy', 'McCoy, Laura E', 'Weiss, Robin A', 'Brown, Corrine S', 'Jackson, Raven', 'Silvestri, Guido', 'Connors, Mark', 'Burton, Dennis R', 'Shaw, George M', 'Nussenzweig, Michel C', 'Bjorkman, Pamela J', 'Ho, David D', 'Farzan, Michael', 'Hahn, Beatrice H']",mBio,10.1128/mBio.00296-15,2015 Apr 21,0,"UNLABELLED: Broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies (bNabs) represent powerful tools to combat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Here, we examined whether HIV-1-specific bNabs are capable of cross-neutralizing distantly related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting central (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) (SIVcpzPtt) and eastern (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) (SIVcpzPts) chimpanzees (n = 11) as well as western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) (SIVgor) (n = 1). We found that bNabs directed against the CD4 binding site (n = 10), peptidoglycans at the base of variable loop 3 (V3) (n = 5), and epitopes at the interface of surface (gp120) and membrane-bound (gp41) envelope glycoproteins (n = 5) failed to neutralize SIVcpz and SIVgor strains. In addition, apex V2-directed bNabs (n = 3) as well as llama-derived (heavy chain only) antibodies (n = 6) recognizing both the CD4 binding site and gp41 epitopes were either completely inactive or neutralized only a fraction of SIVcpzPtt strains. In contrast, one antibody targeting the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of gp41 (10E8), functional CD4 and CCR5 receptor mimetics (eCD4-Ig, eCD4-Ig(mim2), CD4-218.3-E51, and CD4-218.3-E51-mim2), as well as mono- and bispecific anti-human CD4 (iMab and LM52) and CCR5 (PRO140, PRO140-10E8) receptor antibodies neutralized >90% of SIVcpz and SIVgor strains with low-nanomolar (0.13 to 8.4 nM) potency. Importantly, the latter antibodies blocked virus entry not only in TZM-bl cells but also in Cf2Th cells expressing chimpanzee CD4 and CCR5 and neutralized SIVcpz in chimpanzee CD4(+) T cells, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) ranging from 3.6 to 40.5 nM. These findings provide new insight into the protective capacity of anti-HIV-1 bNabs and identify candidates for further development to combat SIVcpz infection.

IMPORTANCE: SIVcpz is widespread in wild-living chimpanzees and can cause AIDS-like immunopathology and clinical disease. HIV-1 infection of humans can be controlled by antiretroviral therapy; however, treatment of wild-living African apes with current drug regimens is not feasible. Nonetheless, it may be possible to curb the spread of SIVcpz in select ape communities using vectored immunoprophylaxis and/or therapy. Here, we show that antibodies and antibody-like inhibitors developed to combat HIV-1 infection in humans are capable of neutralizing genetically diverse SIVcpz and SIVgor strains with considerable breadth and potency, including in primary chimpanzee CD4(+) T cells. These reagents provide an important first step toward translating intervention strategies currently developed to treat and prevent AIDS in humans to SIV-infected apes.

Understanding pathogen diversity and disease ecology is therefore critical for conserving these endangered animals. To determine viral diversity in free-ranging, non-habituated gorillas and chimpanzees in the Republic of Congo, genetic testing was performed on great-ape fecal samples collected near Odzala-Kokoua National Park. Samples were analyzed to determine ape species, identify individuals in the population, and to test for the presence of herpesviruses, adenoviruses, poxviruses, bocaviruses, flaviviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We identified 19 DNA viruses representing two viral families, Herpesviridae and Adenoviridae, of which three herpesviruses had not been previously described. Co-detections of multiple herpesviruses and/or adenoviruses were present in both gorillas and chimpanzees. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and lymphocryptovirus (LCV) were found primarily in the context of co-association with each other and adenoviruses. Using viral discovery curves for herpesviruses and adenoviruses, the total viral richness in the sample population of gorillas and chimpanzees was estimated to be a minimum of 23 viruses, corresponding to a detection rate of 83%. These findings represent the first description of DNA viral diversity in feces from free-ranging gorillas and chimpanzees in or near the Odzala-Kokoua National Park and form a basis for understanding the types of viruses circulating among great apes in this region."

We review recent research on the origins of human decision making by examining whether similar choice biases are seen in nonhuman primates, our closest phylogenetic relatives. We propose that comparative studies can provide insight into four major questions about the nature of human choice biases that cannot be addressed by studies of our species alone. First, research with other primates can address the evolution of human choice biases and identify shared versus human-unique tendencies in decision making. Second, primate studies can constrain hypotheses about the psychological mechanisms underlying such biases. Third, comparisons of closely related species can identify when distinct mechanisms underlie related biases by examining evolutionary dissociations in choice strategies. Finally, comparative work can provide insight into the biological rationality of economically irrational preferences."
"Sharing fruit of Treculia africana among western gorillas in the Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon: Preliminary report","['Yamagiwa, J', 'Tsubokawa, K', 'Inoue, E', 'Ando, C']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-014-0433-3,JAN 2015,0,"We report the first 18 observed cases of fruit (Treculia africana) transfer among western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon. The fruit transfer occurred during our observations of a habituated group of gorillas in 2010 and 2013. Pieces of the fruits were transferred among adults and immatures, and three cases involved a silverback male. Once an individual picked up a fallen fruit of Treculia africana, other members of the group approached the possessor, who laid pieces of the fruits nearby and tolerated the others getting them. Agonistic interaction was rarely observed between the possessor and the non-possessor. Only the silverback male seemed to force another gorilla, a subadult male, to relinquish the fruit on the ground. He tolerated an adult female taking a piece of fruit on his leg and copulated with her on the following days. From these preliminary observations, most interactions over the fruit of Treculia africana among western gorillas in Moukalaba were not active transfer by the possessor but probably passive sharing. They were not only interpreted as a means of acquiring foraging skills by immatures (Nowell and Fletcher 2006) but also similar to behaviors observed in chimpanzees and bonobos in various social contexts."
Geometry of nutrition in field studies: an illustration using wild primates,"['Raubenheimer, D', 'Machovsky-Capuska, GE', 'Chapman, CA', 'Rothman, JM']",OECOLOGIA,10.1007/s00442-014-3142-0,JAN 2015,2,"Nutritional geometry has shown the benefits of viewing nutrition in a multidimensional context, in which foraging is viewed as a process of balancing the intake and use of multiple nutrients. New insights into nutrient regulation have been generated in studies performed in a laboratory context, where accurate measures of amounts (e.g. eaten, converted to body mass, excreted) can be made and analysed using amounts-based nutritional geometry. In most field situations, however, proportional compositions (e.g. of foods, diets, faeces) are the only measures readily available, and in some cases are more relevant to the problem at hand. For this reason, a complementary geometric method was recently introduced for analysing multi-dimensional data on proportional compositions in nutritional studies, called the right-angled mixture triangle (RMT). We use literature data from field studies of primates to demonstrate how the RMT can provide insight into a variety of important concepts in nutritional ecology. We first compare the compositions of foods, using as an example primate milks collected in both the wild and the laboratory. We next compare the diets of different species of primates from the same habitat and of the same species (mountain gorillas) from two distinct forests. Subsequently, we model the relationships between the composition of gorilla diets in these two habitats and the foods that comprise these diets, showing how such analyses can provide evidence for active nutrient-specific regulation in a field context. We provide a framework to relate concepts developed in laboratory studies with field-based studies of nutrition."

Three-Dimensional Geometric Morphometric Analysis of Talar Morphology in Extant Gorilla Taxa from Highland and Lowland Habitats,"['Knigge, RP', 'Tocheri, MW', 'Orr, CM', 'Mcnulty, KP', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.23069,JAN 2015,2,"Western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) are known to climb significantly more often than eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei), a behavioral distinction attributable to major differences in their respective habitats (i.e., highland vs. lowland). Genetic evidence suggests that the lineages leading to these taxa began diverging from one another between approximately 1 and 3 million years ago. Thus, gorillas offer a special opportunity to examine the degree to which morphology of recently diverged taxa may be fine-tuned to differing ecological requirements. Using three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics, we compared talar morphology in a sample of 87 specimens including western (lowland), mountain (highland), and grauer gorillas (lowland and highland populations). Talar shape was captured with a series of landmarks and semilandmarks superimposed by generalized Procrustes analysis. A between-group principal components analysis of overall talar shape separates gorillas by ecological habitat and by taxon. An analysis of only the trochlea and lateral malleolar facet identifies subtle variations in trochlear shape between western lowland and lowland grauer gorillas, potentially indicative of convergent evolution of arboreal adaptations in the talus. Lastly, talar shape scales differently with centroid size for highland and lowland gorillas, suggesting that ankle morphology may track body-size mediated variation in arboreal behaviors differently depending on ecological setting. Several of the observed shape differences are linked biomechanically to the facilitation of climbing in lowland gorillas and to stability and load-bearing on terrestrial substrates in the highland taxa, providing an important comparative model for studying morphological variation in groups known only from fossils (e.g., early hominins).

Emotionality and intentionality in bonobo playful communication,"['Demuru, E', 'Ferrari, PF', 'Palagi, E']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-014-0804-6,JAN 2015,1,"Great apes show very complex systems for communicating emotions and intentions. Whereas gestures are intentional signals, facial expressions can disclose both emotions and intentions. The playful context is a good field to explore the possible dichotomy between intentionally and emotionally driven signals as it has been suggested that one of its functions is to learn producing and decoding communicative patterns. To understand how signals are produced during play and how they are modified in the course of ontogeny, we investigated the use of playful facial expressions and gestures in bonobos (Pan paniscus), a tolerant species showing a high propensity to play even as adults. Our results showed that the use of play faces and gestures is strongly influenced by the characteristics of the play session. Both play faces and gestures were more often performed when social play involved physical contact and when the receiver was visually attending, thus suggesting that both signals can be strategically employed when communicating becomes more urgent. Compared to play faces, gestures were more frequent during dyadic than polyadic sessions, when a unique receiver was involved. Being gestures not context specific, they are probably used more selectively by the sender. On the contrary, play faces are context specific and transmit an unequivocal positive message that cannot be misconceived. These features legitimize a broad use of playful facial expressions, independently of the number of playmates. The similarities and differences in the production of these signals are probably linked to the different degree of emotionality and intentionality characterizing them."

In a genome-scale analysis of the entire Homo sapiens protein-coding genes, we have previously identified core promoters with at least one STR of 6-repeats, with possible selective advantage in this species. In the current study, we performed reverse analysis of the entire Homo sapiens orthologous genes in mouse in the Ensembl database, in order to identify conserved STRs that have shrunk as an evolutionary advantage to humans. Two protocols were used to minimize ascertainment bias. Firstly, two species sharing a more recent ancestor with Homo sapiens (i.e. Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla) were also included in the study. Secondly, four non-primate species encompassing the major orders across Mammals, including Scandentia, Laurasiatheria, Afrotheria, and Xenarthra were analyzed as out-groups. We introduce STR evolutionary events specifically identical in primates (i.e. Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Gorilla gorilla gorilla) vs. non-primate out-groups. The average frequency of the identically shared STR motifs across those primates ranged between 0.00005 and 0.06. The identified genes are involved in important evolutionary and developmental processes, such as normal craniofacial development (TFAP2B), regulation of cell shape (PALMD), learning and long-term memory (RGS14), nervous system development (GFRA2), embryonic limb morphogenesis (PBX2), and forebrain development (APAF1). We provide evidence of core promoter STRs as evolutionary switch codes for primate speciation, and the first instance of identity-by-descent for those motifs at the interspecies level. Am. J.

In particular, infraspinous fossa shape has been shown to significantly differ among hominoids. However, this region presents relatively few homologous landmarks, such that traditional distance and angle-based methods may oversimplify this three-dimensional structure. To more thoroughly assess infraspinous fossa shape variation as it relates to function among adult hominoid representatives, we considered two geometric morphometric (GM) approachesone employing five homologous landmarks (wireframe) and another with 83 sliding semilandmarks along the border of the infraspinous fossa. We identified several differences in infraspinous fossa shape with traditional approaches, particularly in superoinferior fossa breadth and scapular spine orientation. The wireframe analysis reliably captured the range of shape variation in the sample, which reflects the relatively straightforward geometry of the infraspinous fossa. Building on the traditional approach, the GM results highlighted how the orientation of the medial portion of the infraspinous fossa differed relative to both the axillary border and spine. These features distinguished Pan from Gorilla in a way that traditional analyses had not been able to discern. Relative to the wireframe method, the semilandmark approach further distinguished Pongo from Homo, highlighting aspects of infraspinous fossa morphology that may be associated with climbing behaviors in hominoid taxa. These results highlight the ways that GM methods can enhance our ability to evaluate complex aspects of shape for refining and testing hypotheses about functional morphology.

Phenetic and Functional Analyses of the Distal Ulna of Australopithecus afarensis and Australopithecus africanus,"['Tallman, M']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.23078,JAN 2015,0,"The morphology of the distal portion of the hominoid ulna is poorly studied despite its important functional role at the wrist joint. There are five qualitatively well-described fossil hominin distal ulnae belonging to Australopithecus afarensis and Australopithecus africanus, but there have been few efforts to quantify their morphology or relate it to their functional abilities. This article presents an effort to do so, using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to analyze the shape of the distal ulna of the Plio-Pleistocene hominins and an extant comparative sample of great apes and humans. For the extant taxa, results show that the morphology of Pan and Pongo is distinct from that of Homo, and that these differences are likely related to climbing, clambering and below-branch suspension in the former, and the release of the limbs from locomotion and (potentially) tool manufacture in the latter. For the australopiths, results indicate that the A. afarensis sample is relatively heterogeneous. These results are driven by the morphology of A.L. 333-12, which is the largest ulna in the sample and has a unique combination of traits when compared with the other two A. afarensis specimens. Overall, the morphology of all the hominins was most consistent with the pattern displayed by extant great apes, and specifically Pan and Pongo; however, large overlap in shape in the distal ulna in the extant sample indicates that other areas of the skeleton may be more informative for functional analyses.

Three strains, KZ01(T), KZ02 and KZ03, were isolated at the Kyoto City Zoo, Japan, and one strain, GG02, was isolated in the Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon. These strains were investigated taxonomically. These strains belonged to the Lactobacillus reuteri phylogenetic group according to phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and specific phenotypic characteristics. Phylogenetic analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strains KZ01(T), KZ02, KZ03 and GG02 formed a single monophyletic cluster and had a distinct line of descent. Based on sequence similarity of the 16S rRNA gene, Lactobacillus fermentum JCM 1173(T) (96.6%) was the closest neighbour to these novel strains, although it was clear that these strains belonged to a different species. Partial pheS sequences also supported these relationships. DNA DNA relatedness between strain KZ01(T) and L. fermentum JCM 1173(T) was less than 22% and the DNA G+C content of strain KZ01(T) was 50.7 mol%. The cell-wall peptidoglycan type was AO (L-Orn D-Asp) and the major fatty acids were C-16:0, C-18:1 omega 9c and C-19:1 cyclo 9,10. Therefore, based on phylogenetic, phenotypic and physiological evidence, these strains represent a novel species of the genus Lactobacillus, for which the name Lactobacillus gorillae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KZ01(T) (=JCM 19575(T)=DSM 28356(T))."

Looking in apes as a source of human pathogens,"['Keita, MB', 'Hamad, I', 'Bittar, F']",MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS,10.1016/j.micpath.2014.09.003,DEC 2014,1,"Because of the close genetic relatedness between apes and humans, apes are susceptible to many human infectious agents and can serve as carriers of these pathogens. Consequently, they present a serious health hazard to humans. Moreover, many emerging infectious diseases originate in wildlife and continue to threaten human populations, especially vector-borne diseases described in great apes, such as malaria and rickettsiosis. These wild primates may be permanent reservoirs and important sources of human pathogens. In this special issue, we report that apes, including chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei), orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus and Pongo abelii), gibbons (Hylobates spp., Hoolock spp. and Nomascus spp) and siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus syndactylus and Symphalangus continentis), have many bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic species that are capable of infecting humans. Serious measures should be adopted in tropical forests and sub-tropical areas where habitat overlaps are frequent to survey and prevent infectious diseases from spreading from apes to people.

Identification of species-specific nuclear insertions of mitochondrial DNA (numts) in gorillas and their potential as population genetic markers,"['Soto-Calderon, ID', 'Clark, NJ', 'Wildschutte, JVH', 'DiMattio, K', 'Jensen-Seaman, MI', 'Anthony, NM']",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.ympev.2014.08.018,DEC 2014,3,"The first hyper-variable region (HV1) of the mitochondrial control region (MCR) has been widely used as a molecular tool in population genetics, but inadvertent amplification of nuclear translocated copies of mitochondrial DNA (numts) in gorillas has compromised the use of mitochondrial DNA in population genetic studies. At least three putative classes (I, II, III) of gorilla-specific HV1 MCR numts have been uncovered over the past decade. However, the number, size and location of numt loci in gorillas and other apes are completely unknown. Furthermore, little work to date has assessed the utility of numts as candidate population genetic markers. In the present study, we screened Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) genomic libraries in the chimpanzee and gorilla to compare patterns of mitochondrial-wide insertion in both taxa. We conducted an intensive BLAST search for numts in the gorilla genome and compared the prevalence of numt loci originating from the MCR with other great ape taxa. Additional gorilla-specific MCR numts were retrieved either through BAC library screens or using an anchored-PCR (A-PCR) amplification using genomic DNA from five unrelated gorillas. Locus-specific primers were designed to identify numt insertional polymorphisms and evaluate their potential as population genetic markers. Mitochondrial-wide surveys of chimpanzee and gorilla BACs showed that the number of numts does not differ between these two taxa. However, MCR numts are more abundant in chimpanzees than in other great apes. We identified and mapped 67 putative gorilla-specific numts, including two that contain the entire HV1 domain, cluster with sequences from two numt classes (I, IIb) and will likely co-amplify with mitochondrial sequences using most published HV1 primers. However, phylogenetic analysis coupled with post-hoc analysis of mitochondrial variation can successfully differentiate nuclear sequences. Insertional polymorphisms were evident in three out of five numts examined, indicating their potential utility as molecular markers. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potentially powerful insight that numts could make in uncovering population history in gorillas and other mammals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Plant mineral concentrations related to foraging preferences of western lowland gorilla in Central African forest clearings.,"['Metsio Sienne, Julia', 'Buchwald, Rainer', 'Wittemyer, George']",American journal of primatology,10.1002/ajp.22297,2014-Dec (Epub 2014 May 27),0,"In the Central African rain forest, mineral resources essential to organisms are distributed heterogeneously. Forest clearings, locally known as bais, attract numerous species presumably due to the mineral richness of these sites, though understanding of the factors drawing species to bais remains speculative. Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla) selectively feed on particular plant species and parts within bais, but studies of such feeding preferences have focused on one site. Here, we compared concentrations of minerals and macronutrients from plants gorillas consumed and those they did not in 16 bais to gain inference regarding drivers of resource selection within bais and bai use. The availability of gorilla feeding plants varied between surveyed bais, with some consumed species occurring only at a few bais. Regardless of bai specific species composition, significantly higher concentrations of Na, K, and Ca were found in consumed plants, and other trace minerals were more common in consumed plants. In contrast, macronutrients appeared to play no major role in feeding plant selectivity with consumed species often having lower concentrations than non-consumed species. We found evidence for seasonal differences in Mg and Na concentrations, but the concentrations of other minerals in consumed plants were consistent across time. These findings provide insight to the drivers of bai visitation by gorillas. The high variation in species across bais may elicit use of multiple bais, but the general increased mineral composition of consumed species across bais suggests metabolic requirements may be met through consumption of a variety of species.  2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

However, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. For this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 Gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis) were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. By applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. Many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; Mycobacterium bolletii, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum. The genus Treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. Using specific real-time PCR on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria Bartonella spp. Borrelia spp., Coxiella burnetii and Tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. We estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. Therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence."
Diversity of zoonotic enterohepatic Helicobacter species and detection of a putative novel gastric Helicobacter species in wild and wild-born captive chimpanzees and western lowland gorillas,"['Flahou, B', 'Modry, D', 'Pomajbikova, K', 'Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Smet, A', 'Ducatelle, R', 'Pasmans, F', 'Sa, RM', 'Todd, A', 'Hashimoto, C', 'Mulama, M', 'Kiang, J', 'Rossi, M', 'Haesebrouck, F']",VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY,10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.08.032,NOV 7 2014,2,"A number of Helicobacter species cause gastrointestinal or hepatic disease in humans, including H. pylori, gastric non-H. pylori helicobacters from animal origin and enterohepatic Helicobacter species.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of gastric and enterohepatic Helicobacter species in African chimpanzees and gorillas. Fresh fecal samples were collected from wild endangered chimpanzees and critically endangered western lowland gorillas from different African National Parks, as well as wild-born captive animals from primate sanctuaries. Intact Helicobacter bacteria were demonstrated in feces by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Screening using a Helicobacter genus-specific PCR revealed the presence of Helicobacter DNA in the majority of animals in all groups. Cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments revealed a high homology to sequences from various zoonotic enterohepatic Helicobacter species, including H. cinaedi and H. canadensis. A number of gorillas and chimpanzees also tested positive using PCR assays designed to amplify part of the ureAB gene cluster and the hsp60 gene of gastric helicobacters. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of a putative novel zoonotic gastric Helicobacter taxon/species. For this species, we propose the name 'Candidatus Helicobacter homininae', pending isolation and further genetic characterization. The presence of several Helicobacter species not only implies a possible health threat for these endangered great apes, but also a possible zoonotic transmission of gastric and enterohepatic helicobacters from these primate reservoirs to humans.

Our results suggest that eastern lowland gorillas and mountain gorillas split beginning some 10 000 years ago, followed 5000 years ago by the split of the two mountain gorilla populations of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and the Virungas Massif. All three populations have decreased in effective population size, with particularly substantial 10- fold decreases for the mountain gorillas.

Fresh fecal samples were pooled within species and used to inoculate in vitro batch cultures. Acetate, propionate, butyrate and valerate were measured after 24 h of incubation. Eubacterial DNA was extracted from individual fecal samples, pooled, and the cpn60 gene region was amplified and then sequenced to identify the major eubacterial constituents associated with each host species. Short chain fatty acids (P < 0.001) and methane (P < 0.001) were significantly different across species.

In 2012, the decision was made to retire a large number of laboratory chimpanzees in the United States of America. Relocation of these animals to sanctuaries, rescue centres, and zoos involve several changes in environment and husbandry routines. Because these animals often have a history of maternal deprivation, and consequently may suffer from an increased sensitivity to stress, these management changes may affect their behaviour. In The Netherlands, six groups of adult chimpanzees (n = 28), which were removed from their mother when juvenile and were hand or peer reared, were relocated from a biomedical laboratory to substantially larger enclosures at a Dutch sanctuary. This sanctuary applied different animal management routines. It was studied whether long-term agonistic, affiliative, and abnormal behaviour was affected by the relocation and alteration in behavioural management. The chimpanzees' behaviour was observed at the laboratory and during four years at the sanctuary, which resulted in 309 h of observational data. Results indicated that the chimpanzees performed more allogrooming and less aggressive interactions at the sanctuary compared to the laboratory. However, abnormal behaviour was performed more often at the sanctuary. These results suggest that additional measures should be taken to enhance the welfare level of chimpanzees, at least for those that have a history of maternal deprivation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of the forearm rotational efficiency in extant hominoids: New insights into the functional implications of upper limb skeletal structure,"['Ibanez-Gimeno, P', 'Galtes, I', 'Manyosa, J', 'Malgosa, A', 'Jordana, X', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.08.004,NOV 2014,0,"The greatly diversified locomotor behaviors in the Hominoidea impose different mechanical requirements in the upper limb of each species. As forearm rotation has a major role in locomotion, the skeletal structures involved in this movement may display differences among taxa that reflect functional adaptations. To test this, we use a biomechanical model that quantifies the rotatory capacity of pronator teres (rotational efficiency) from skeletal measurements. Using a large sample of hominoids, we aim to identify the morphological adaptations that confer differences in the mechanics of forearm motion and to assess the functional advantage of these adaptations. Forearm positions along the pronation supination range where rotational efficiency is maximal depend on the orientation of the humeral medial epicondyle and differ among taxa. Our results indicate that these are related to locomotor mode. Knuckle-walkers exhibit a medial epicondyle more posteriorly directed, which, in elbow angles close to extension, causes rotational efficiency to be maximal in pronated positions of the forearm. Species with a significant amount of arboreal locomotion, such as vertical climbing, i.e.. Pongo spp., Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla, display more proximally oriented epicondyles, which, in elbow flexion, leads to maximum rotational efficiencies in supinated positions of the forearm. Hylobatidae, with the less posteriorly and proximally oriented epicondyle, show their maximum rotational efficiencies closer to the forearm neutral position throughout most of the flexion extension range, which may be linked to brachiation in this taxon. In humans, the epicondylar orientation and thus the positions of the maximum rotational efficiencies fall between arboreal and terrestrial hominoids. This may be related to the enhanced manipulative skills of the upper limb. In conclusion, the current analysis indicates that the orientation of the humeral medial epicondyle is linked to the locomotor habits of extant hominoids and therefore can be used for locomotor inferences in fossil taxa.

However, few studies have assessed hand preference in the natural repertoire of motor behaviours in nonhuman primates, especially in actions that differ in velocity. Nevertheless, velocity is involved in the coordination between the upper limb joints and could be related to cerebral hemispheric specialization. Indeed, depending on the velocity, some joints, and so some muscles, are used more than others. The purpose of this study was to quantify hand preference across various natural actions to evaluate how the nature of the action modifies hand preference in capuchin and squirrel monkeys. First, we observed seven female tufted capuchin monkeys during spontaneous foraging, performing fast actions (pounding and capturing fast-moving prey) and slow actions (picking fruit, carrying, tapping and catching slow-moving prey). Second, we observed seven squirrel monkeys performing fast actions (capturing fast-moving prey) and slow actions (picking fruit and catching slow-moving prey) in their enclosure. The results showed that (1) capturing fast-moving prey and pounding were associated with a left-hand preference and (2) slow actions were associated with variable hand preferences. Fast manual actions may elicit consistent hand preference. Given that many nonhuman primates use fast actions to capture prey, this possibility deserves further investigation. If this finding is confirmed, a novel link between motor control processes and hand preference can be pursued. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

African Great Apes Are Naturally Infected with Roseoloviruses Closely Related to Human Herpesvirus 7,"['Lavergne, A', 'Donato, D', 'Gessain, A', 'Niphuis, H', 'Nerrienet, E', 'Verschoor, EJ', 'Lacoste, V']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.01490-14,NOV 2014,0,"Primates are naturally infected with herpesviruses. During the last 15 years, the search for homologues of human herpesviruses in nonhuman primates allowed the identification of numerous viruses belonging to the different herpesvirus subfamilies and genera. No simian homologue of human herpesvirus 7 (HHV7) has been reported to date. To investigate the putative existence of HHV7-like viruses in African great apes, we applied the consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers (CODEHOP) program-mediated PCR strategy to blood DNA samples from the four common chimpanzee subspecies (Pan troglodytes verus, P. t. ellioti, P. t. troglodytes, and P. t. schweinfurthii), pygmy chimpanzees (Pan paniscus), as well as lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). This study led to the discovery of a novel roseolovirus close to HHV7 in each of these nonhuman primate species and subspecies. Generation of the partial glycoprotein B (1,111-bp) and full-length DNA polymerase (3,036/3,042-bp) gene sequences allowed the deciphering of their evolutionary relationships. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HHV7 and its African great ape homologues formed well-supported monophyletic lineages whose topological resemblance to the host phylogeny is suggestive of virus-host codivergence. Notably, the evolutionary branching points that separate HHV7 from African great ape herpesvirus 7 are remarkably congruent with the dates of divergence of their hosts. Our study shows that African great apes are hosts of human herpesvirus homologues, including HHV7 homologues, and that the latter, like other DNA viruses that establish persistent infections, have cospeciated with their hosts.

IMPORTANCE

Human herpesviruses are known to possess simian homologues. However, surprisingly, none has been identified to date for human herpesvirus 7 (HHV7). This study is the first to describe simian homologues of HHV7. The extensive search performed on almost all African great ape species and subspecies, i.e., common chimpanzees of the four subspecies, bonobos, and lowland gorillas, has allowed characterization of a specific virus in each. Genetic characterization of the partial glycoprotein B and fulllength DNA polymerase gene sequences, followed by their phylogenetic analysis and estimation of divergence times, has shed light on the evolutionary relationships of these viruses. In this respect, we conclusively demonstrate the cospeciation between these new viruses and their hosts and report cases of cross-species transmission between two common chimpanzee subspecies in both directions."

SFV DNA was detected in the majority of the CD8(+), CD4(+), and CD19(+) lymphocyte samples and rarely in CD14(+) monocyte and CD56(+) NK lymphocyte samples. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) SFV DNA counts were 16.0 (11.0 to 49.8), 11.3 (5.9 to 28.3), and 17.2 (2.0 to 25.2) copies/105 cells in CD8(+) T lymphocytes, CD4(+) T lymphocytes, and CD19(+) B lymphocytes, respectively. In the CD4 compartment, SFV DNA was detected in both memory and naive CD4(+) T lymphocytes. SFV DNA levels in CD4(+) T cells were positively correlated with the duration of the infection. Our study shows with a quantitative method that CD8(+), CD4(+), and B lymphocytes are major cellular targets of SFV in the blood of infected humans.

IMPORTANCE

Investigation of SFV infections in humans is important due to the origin of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and human T cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) from cross-species transmission of their simian counterparts to humans. Surprisingly little is known about many aspects of the biology of SFV in infected humans, including quantitative data concerning the cellular targets of SFV in vivo. Here we show that the distribution of SFV DNA among the different leukocyte populations is not homogeneous and that viral load in CD4(+) T lymphocytes is correlated with the duration of infection. These new data will help in understanding the biology of retroviral infections in humans and can be useful in the growing field of SFV-based gene therapy."

Complete Mitochondrial Genome Sequence of the Eastern Gorilla (Gorilla beringei) and Implications for African Ape Biogeography,"['Das, R', 'Hergenrother, SD', 'Soto-Calderon, ID', 'Dew, JL', 'Anthony, NM', 'Jensen-Seaman, MI']",JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,10.1093/jhered/esu056,NOV-DEC 2014,0,"The Western and Eastern species of gorillas (Gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei) began diverging in the mid-Pleistocene, but in a complex pattern with ongoing gene flow following their initial split. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of 1 Eastern and 1 Western gorilla to provide the most accurate date for their mitochondrial divergence, and to analyze patterns of nucleotide substitutions. The most recent common ancestor of these genomes existed about 1.9 million years ago, slightly more recent than that of chimpanzee and bonobo. We in turn use this date as a calibration to reanalyze sequences from the Eastern lowland and mountain gorilla subspecies to estimate their mitochondrial divergence at approximately 380000 years ago. These dates help frame a hypothesis whereby populations became isolated nearly 2 million years ago with restricted maternal gene flow, followed by ongoing male migration until the recent past. This process of divergence with prolonged hybridization occurred against the backdrop of the African Pleistocene, characterized by intense fluctuations in temperature and aridity, while at the same time experiencing tectonic uplifting and consequent shifts in the drainage of major river systems. Interestingly, this same pattern of introgression following divergence and discrepancies between mitochondrial and nuclear loci is seen in fossil hominins from Eurasia, suggesting that such processes may be common in hominids and that living gorillas may provide a useful model for understanding isolation and migration in our extinct relatives."
Is there a link between the crafting of tools and the evolution of cognition?,"['Taylor, AH', 'Gray, RD']",WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COGNITIVE SCIENCE,10.1002/wcs.1322,NOV-DEC 2014,1,"The ability to craft tools is one of the defining features of our species. The technical intelligence hypothesis predicts that tool-making species should have enhanced physical cognition. Here we review how the physical problem-solving performance of tool-making apes and corvids compares to closely related species. We conclude that, while some performance differences have been found, overall the evidence is at best equivocal. We argue that increased sample sizes, novel experimental designs, and a signature-testing approach are required to determine the effect tool crafting has on the evolution of intelligence.

The Function of Loud Calls (Hoot Series) in Wild Western Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla),"['Salmi, R', 'Doran-Sheehy, DM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22575,NOV 2014,1,"The use of loud vocal signals to reduce distance among separated social partners is well documented in many species; however, the underlying mechanisms by which the reduction of spacing occurs and how they differ across species remain unclear. Western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) offer an opportunity to investigate these issues because their vocal repertoire includes a loud, long-distance call (i.e., hoot series) that is potentially used in within-group communication, whereas mountain gorillas use an identical call exclusively during intergroup encounters. First, we tested whether the hoot series functions as a contact/separation call. Second, we examined which individuals were more likely to reply and which party was more responsible for decreasing distance to identify the underlying mechanisms and cognitive implications of hoot series. We collected behavioral, spatial, and acoustic data on five adult gorillas over 15 months at the Mondika Research Center (Republic of Congo and CAR). Hoot series are individually distinct calls and given by both male and female gorillas when separated from each other. Following hooting, the distance between separated group members decreased significantly; thus we concluded that western gorillas use this call to reestablish group cohesion. The way in which proximity was achieved depended upon listeners replying or not to the caller. Replies may indicate a conflict between callers about intended travel direction, with vocal interchanges serving to negotiate a consensus. Although the acoustic features of vocal signals are highly constrained in closely related species, our results demonstrate that the function and usage of particular calls can be flexible.

The pisiform growth plate is lost in humans and supports a role for Hox in growth plate formation,"['Kjosness, KM', 'Hines, JE', 'Lovejoy, CO', 'Reno, PL']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/joa.12235,NOV 2014,0,"The human pisiform is a small, nodular, although functionally significant, bone of the wrist. In most other mammals, including apes and Australopithecus afarensis, pisiforms are elongate. An underappreciated fact is that the typical mammalian pisiform forms from two ossification centers. We hypothesize that: (i) the presence of a secondary ossification center in mammalian pisiforms indicates the existence of a growth plate; and (ii) human pisiform reduction results from growth plate loss. To address these hypotheses, we surveyed African ape pisiform ossification and confirmed the presence of a late-forming secondary ossification center in chimpanzees and gorillas. Identification of the initial ossification center occurs substantially earlier in apes relative to humans, raising questions concerning the homology of the human pisiform and the two mammalian ossification centers. Second, we conducted histological and immunohistochemical analyses of pisiform ossification in mice. We confirm the presence of two ossification centers separated by organized columnar and hypertrophic chondrocyte zones. Flattened chondrocytes were highly mitotic, indicating the presence of a growth plate. Hox genes have been proposed to play a fundamental role in growth plate patterning. The existence of a pisiform growth plate presents an interesting test case for the association between Hox expression and growth plate formation, and could explain the severe effects on the pisiform observed in Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 knockout mice. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that Hoxd11 is expressed adjacent to the pisiform in late-stage embryonic mouse limbs supporting a role for Hox genes in growth plate specification. This raises questions concerning the mechanisms regulating Hox expression in the developing carpus."
To bet or not to bet? Decision-making under risk in non-human primates,"['Pele, M', 'Broihanne, MH', 'Thierry, B', 'Call, J', 'Dufour, V']",JOURNAL OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY,10.1007/s11166-014-9202-3,OCT 2014,0,"Animals deal with predictable and unpredictable events on a daily basis. Yet our knowledge of the cognitive processes involved in decisions remains limited. We tested capuchins, macaques and orang-utans in a food-gambling task to investigate whether or not individuals estimate the chances of different outcomes. Results highlighted that gambling decisions were negatively induced by the probability of losing and the frequency of previous losses, and positively induced by the probability of gaining. Actual decisions were consistent with first order stochastic dominance. The study of second order stochastic dominance revealed that macaques were risk-prone whereas capuchins and orang-utans were risk-adverse. We detected responses comparable to the hot-hand effect, a bias found in humans. Capuchins and orang-utans exhibited probability distortion and loss aversion, which were not systematically found in macaques. Given the heterogeneity among individuals, we implemented mixture models and showed that attitudes towards risk and probabilities play complementary and different roles in the three species."
Food Neophobia and Social Learning Opportunities in Great Apes,"['Gustafsson, E', 'Saint Jalme, M', 'Bomsel, MC', 'Krief, S']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-014-9796-y,OCT 2014,2,"Finding food resources and maintaining a balanced diet are major concerns for all animals. A compromise between neophobia and neophilia is hypothesised to enable animals to enlarge their diet while limiting the risk of poisoning. However, little is known about how primates respond to novel food items and whether their use is socially transmitted. By comparing how four different species of great apes respond to novel food items, we investigated how differences in physiology (digestive tract size and microbial content), habitats (predictability of food availability), and social systems (group size and composition) affect their response toward novelty. We presented two familiar foods, one novel fruit, four novel aromatic plants from herbal medicine, and kaolin to captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii). We recorded smelling, approach-taste delays, ingestion, interindividual observations, and food transfers with continuous sampling. We found that behaviors differed between the apes: chimpanzees were the most cautious species and observed their conspecifics handling the items more frequently than the other apes. Close observations and food transfers were extremely rare in gorillas in comparison to orangutans and chimpanzees. We suggest that a low neophobia level reflects an adaptive response to digestive physiological features in gorillas and to unpredictable food availability in orangutans. Social interactions appeared to be predominant in chimpanzees and in both orangutan species to overcome food neophobia. They reflect higher social tolerance and more opportunities for social learning and cultural transmission in a feeding context."
Abstract Knowledge in the Broken-String Problem: Evidence from Nonhuman Primates and Pre-Schoolers,"['Mayer, C', 'Call, J', 'Albiach-Serrano, A', 'Visalberghi, E', 'Sabbatini, G', 'Seed, A']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0108597,OCT 1 2014,2,"There is still large controversy about whether abstract knowledge of physical problems is uniquely human. We presented 9 capuchin monkeys, 6 bonobos, 6 chimpanzees and 48 children with two versions of a broken-string problem. In the standard condition, participants had to choose between an intact and a broken string as means to a reward. In the critical condition, the functional parts of the strings were covered up and replaced by perceptually similar, but non-functional cues. Apes, monkeys and young children performed significantly better in the standard condition in which the cues played a functional role, indicating knowledge of the functional properties involved. Moreover, a control experiment with chimpanzees and young children ruled out that this difference in performance could be accounted for by differences of perceptual feedback in the two conditions. We suggest that, similar to humans, nonhuman primates partly rely on abstract concepts in physical problem-solving."
Double invisible displacement understanding in orangutans: testing in non-locomotor and locomotor space,"['Mallavarapu, S', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Perdue, BM', 'Maple, TL']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-014-0439-x,OCT 2014,0,"The nonadjacent double invisible displacement task has been used to test for the ability of different species to mentally represent the unperceived trajectory of an object. The task typically requires three occluders/boxes in a linear array and involves hiding an object in one of two nonadjacent boxes visited in succession. Previous research indicates that 19-, 26-, and 30-month-old children and various nonhuman species cannot solve these displacements. It has been hypothesized that this is because individuals are unable to inhibit searching in the unbaited center box that was never visited by the experimenter. It has been suggested that presenting the task in a large-scale locomotor space might allow individuals to overcome this inhibition problem. In the present study, we tested orangutans on adjacent and nonadjacent double invisible displacements with the traditional setup (experiment 1) and in locomotor space with boxes placed 1.22 m apart (experiment 2). In both experiments, subjects were able to solve adjacent, but not nonadjacent, trials. The failure on nonadjacent trials appeared to be because of an inability to inhibit sequential search on the second choice as well as because of a large number of first-choice errors (directly choosing an incorrect box). The current results support previous findings that orangutans exhibit some constraints when representing the invisible trajectory of objects."
Human-Animal Relationships in Zoo-Housed Orangutans (P. abelii) and Gorillas (G. g. gorilla): The Effects of Familiarity,"['Smith, JJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22280,OCT 2014,0,"I examined human-animal relationships (HARs) in zoo-housed orangutans (Pongo abelii) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) to see if they followed patterns similar to conspecific relationships in great apes and humans. Familiarity and social relationships guide humans' and great apes' behaviors with conspecifics. Inter-individual relationships, based on shared social history, and ""generalized"" relationships, based on a history of interactions with relevant classes of individuals, guide behavior with familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics, respectively. I examined whether both familiarity and social relationships similarly guides great apes' cross-species interactions with humans. I used repeated measures MANOVA to compare hourly rates and average durations of ape-initiated human-directed behaviors (HDBs) between familiar and unfamiliar humans and between great ape species. HDB patterns were consistent with familiarity-based HAR predictions, indicating more negative relationships with unfamiliar humans and more positive relationships with familiar humans. Findings for unfamiliar humans are consistent with negative effects of humans on apes' behavior reported in traditional visitor effect studies (VES). However, findings for familiar humans may be overlooked in VES due to pooling across levels of human familiarity or failure to consider humans other than primarily unfamiliar visitors. Additionally, species differences in apes' HDBs suggest that data pooling across species, common in many zoo studies, may mask important differences. These findings have important methodological implications for studies of human-animal interaction as well as for captive animal wellbeing. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Informing Conservation Management About Structural Versus Functional Connectivity: A Case-Study of Cross River Gorillas,"['Imong, I', 'Robbins, MM', 'Mundry, R', 'Bergl, R', 'Kuhl, HS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22287,OCT 2014,1,"Connectivity among subpopulations is vital for the persistence of small and fragmented populations. For management interventions to be effective conservation planners have to make the critical distinction between structural connectivity (based on landscape structure) and functional connectivity (which considers both landscape structure and organism-specific behavioral attributes) which can differ considerably within a given context. We assessed spatial and temporal changes in structural and functional connectivity of the Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli (CRG) population in a 12,000km(2) landscape in the Nigeria-Cameroon border region over a 23-year period, comparing two periods: 19872000 and 2000-2010. Despite substantial forest connections between occupied areas, genetic evidence shows that only limited dispersal occurs among CRG subpopulations. We used remotely sensed land-cover data and simulated human pressure (using a spatially explicit agent-based model) to assess human impact on connectivity of the CRG population. We calculated cost-weighted distances between areas occupied by gorillas as measures of connectivity (structural based on land-cover only, functional based on both land-cover and simulated human pressure). Whereas structural connectivity decreased by 5% over the 23-year period, functional connectivity decreased by 11%, with both decreasing more during the latter compared to the earlier period. Our results highlight the increasing threat of isolation of CRG subpopulations due to human disturbance, and provide insight into how increasing human influence may lead to functional isolation of wildlife populations despite habitat continuity, a pressing and common issue in tropical Africa often not accounted for when deciding management interventions. In addition to quantifying threats to connectivity, our study provides crucial evidence for management authorities to identify actions that are more likely to be effective for conservation of species in human-dominated landscapes. Our approach can be easily applied to other species, regions, and scales. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

In this study, we cloned the full coding region of NR1H4 gene from porcine Longissimus dorsi by Rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE). Results indicated that the open reading frame of NR1H4 covered 1461 bp encoding 486 amino acid residues and the deduced amino acid sequence was 91-94 % identical to that of Homo sapiens, Bos taurus, Macaca mulatta, Gorilla gorilla, and Ovis aries. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that NR1H4 contained 31 phosphorylation sites with 14 serine, 6 threonine and 11 tyrosine. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected by PCR-RFLP in 3' untranslated region of exon 9 (NR1H4) and the allele frequency analysis showed that A allele frequency was low among 396 pigs from five breeds. The NR1H4 mRNA expression pattern showed that NR1H4 gene was expressed highly in live and Longissimus dorsi.

A species' Odyssey: evolution of obstetrical mechanics from Australopithecus Lucy to nowadays,"['Chene, G', 'Tardieu, AS', 'Trombert, B', 'Amouzougan, A', 'Lamblin, G', 'Mellier, G', 'Coppens, Y']",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2014.08.027,OCT 2014,2,"Objective: Study of obstetrical mechanics of Australopithecus Lucy, Homo neanderthalensis and Homo erectus relative to modern Homo sapiens and the Catarrhines.

Study design: The material comprised a total of 360 pelves: 3 fossil pelves reconstructed using casts (Australopithecus afarensis Lucy or AL 288-1, Homo erectus KNM-WT 15000, H. neanderthalensis or Kebara 2), 305 female modern adult pelves and 52 female Catarrhine pelves (29 gorillas, 18 chimpanzees, 5 orang-utans). All these pelves were reconstructed in order to carry out 11 pelvimetric measurements. Each measurement was carried out twice and by two different operators.

Results: The pelvis of Lucy was platypelloid at each pelvic plane. The pelvic inlet of H. neanderthalensis was anteroposteriorly oval whereas the midplane and the outlet were transversely oval. The pelvis of H. erectus was globally round. In modern women, the inlet was transversely oval. The pelvic midplane and outlet were anteroposteriorly oval. In the great apes, the shape of all three pelvic planes was anteroposteriorly oval.

The discriminating value of the various pelvimetry measurements place Australopithecus Lucy, H. neanderthalensis Kebara 2, and H. erectus KNM-WT 15000 close to modern humans and less similar to the great apes.

Conclusion: Obstetrical mechanics evolved from dystocic delivery with a transverse orientation in Australopithecus to delivery with a modern human-like rotational birth and an increase in the anteroposterior diameters in H. erectus, H. neanderthalensis and modern H. sapiens.

Variance in the reproductive success of dominant male mountain gorillas,"['Robbins, AM', 'Gray, M', 'Uwingeli, P', 'Mburanumwe, I', 'Kagoda, E', 'Robbins, MM', 'VERREAUXS SIFAKA']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-014-0426-2,OCT 2014,3,"Using 30 years of demographic data from 15 groups, this study estimates how harem size, female fertility, and offspring survival may contribute to variance in the siring rates of dominant male mountain gorillas throughout the Virunga Volcano Region. As predicted for polygynous species, differences in harem size were the greatest source of variance in the siring rate, whereas differences in female fertility and offspring survival were relatively minor. Harem size was positively correlated with offspring survival, even after removing all known and suspected cases of infanticide, so the correlation does not seem to reflect differences in the ability of males to protect their offspring. Harem size was not significantly correlated with female fertility, which is consistent with the hypothesis that mountain gorillas have minimal feeding competition. Harem size, offspring survival, and siring rates were not significantly correlated with the proportion of dominant tenures that occurred in multimale groups versus one-male groups; even though infanticide is less likely when those tenures end in multimale groups than one-male groups. In contrast with the relatively small contribution of offspring survival to variance in the siring rates of this study, offspring survival is a major source of variance in the male reproductive success of western gorillas, which have greater predation risks and significantly higher rates of infanticide. If differences in offspring protection are less important among male mountain gorillas than western gorillas, then the relative importance of other factors may be greater for mountain gorillas. Thus, our study illustrates how variance in male reproductive success and its components can differ between closely related species."
High diversity of MIC genes in non-human primates,"['Meyer, A', 'Carapito, R', 'Ott, L', 'Radosavljevic, M', 'Georgel, P', 'Adams, EJ', 'Parham, P', 'Bontrop, RE', 'Blancher, A', 'Bahram, S']",IMMUNOGENETICS,10.1007/s00251-014-0791-4,OCT 2014,4,"The human MHC class I (MHC-I) chain-related genes A and B (MICA and MICB) encode stress-induced glycoproteins, ligands for the activating receptor NKG2D. They display an unusually high degree of polymorphism, next only to that of classical MHC-I. The functional relevance and selective pressure behind this peculiar polymorphism, which is quite distinct from that of classical MHC-I, remain largely unknown. This study increases the repertoire of allelic sequences determined for the MIC genes of non-human primates. Sequencing (mainly exons 2, 3, 4, 5) MIC genes of 72 Macaca fascicularis (Mafa), 63 Pan troglodytes (Patr), and 18 Gorilla gorilla (Gogo) individuals led to the identification of 35, 14, and 3 new alleles, respectively. Additionally, we confirm the existence of three independent MIC genes in M. fascicularis, i.e., Mafa-MICA, Mafa-MICB, and Mafa-MICB/A, the latter being a hybrid of Mafa-MICB and Mafa-MICA. By multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, we further demonstrate that the present day MIC genes most likely derive from a single human MICB-like ancestral gene."
Hypothesis: Brain size and skull shape as criteria for a new hominin family tree,"['Chardin, P', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-SEDIBA']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jchb.2013.11.006,2014,0,"Today, gorillas and chimpanzees live in tropical forests, where acid soils do not favor fossilization. It is thus widely believed that there are no fossils of chimpanzees or gorillas. However, four teeth of a 0.5-million-year (Ma)-old chimpanzee were discovered in the rift valley of Kenya (McBrearty and Jablonski, 2005), and a handful of teeth of a 10-Ma-old gorilla-like creature were found in Ethiopia (Suwa et al., 2007), close to the major sites of Homo discoveries. These discoveries indicate that chimpanzees and gorillas once shared their range with early Homo. However, the thousands of hominin fossils discovered in the past century have all been attributed to the Homo line. Thus far, our family tree looks like a bush with many dead-branches. If one admits the possibility that the australopithecines can also be the ancestors of African great apes, one can place Paranthropus on the side of gorilla ancestors and divide the remaining Australopithecus based on the brain size into the two main lines of humans and chimpanzees, thereby resulting in a coherent family tree.

Western lowland gorilla density and nesting behavior in a Gabonese forest logged for 25 years: implications for gorilla conservation,"['Haurez, B', 'Petre, CA', 'Vermeulen, C', 'Tagg, N', 'Doucet, JL']",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,10.1007/s10531-014-0743-1,OCT 2014,4,"The tropical forests of the Congo Basin constitute biodiversity refuges that still hold large numbers of species, including endemic and endangered vertebrates. Along with several key species, the critically endangered western lowland gorilla (WLG) potentially contributes to forest dynamics through seed dispersal. Considering the extensive influence of timber harvesting on tropical forest ecosystems, the survival of gorilla populations in logged forests might prove critical for forest ecosystem conservation. We estimated WLG density, through a nest count survey, in a forest in southeast Gabon that has been logged for 25 years. Nesting behavior and habitat use were described and we applied generalized linear models to identify the factors that influence gorilla day and night habitat use. The estimated density of weaned gorillas, 1.5 gorillas km(-2), is comparable with estimates from some protected areas and other sustainably managed sites within their range. Habitat type had the greatest influence on nest site distribution. We observed a preference for nesting in open terra firma forest, and open habitats in general, which supports the findings of previous studies. Habitat use during the day was strongly influenced by habitat type and human activities, and to a lesser degree by functional and non-functional roads, and rivers. Our results support the suggestion that logged forests are suitable habitats for WLG if hunting and poaching are controlled. We recommend collaborations between timber operators and scientists to improve the conservation potential of tropical forests and enhance the wildlife-management aspects of logging practices."

Herein, 35 eukaryotic primer sets targeting the 18S rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer gene and other specific genes were used firstly to explore the eukaryotes in a fecal sample from a wild western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Then specific real-time PCRs were achieved in additional 48 fecal samples from 21 individual gorillas to investigate the presence of human eukaryotic pathogens. In total, 1,572 clones were obtained and sequenced from the 15 cloning libraries, resulting in the retrieval of 87 eukaryotic species, including 52 fungi, 10 protozoa, 4 nematodes and 21 plant species, of which 52, 5, 2 and 21 species, respectively, have never before been described in gorillas. We also reported the occurrence of pathogenic fungi and parasites (i.e. Oesophagostomum bifurcum (86%), Necator americanus (43%), Candida tropicalis (81%) and other pathogenic fungi were identified). In conclusion, molecular techniques using multiple primer sets may offer an effective tool to study complex eukaryotic communities and to identify potential pathogens in the gastrointestinal tracts of primates."
Bayesian Estimation of the Phylogeography of African Gorillas with Genome-Differentiated Population Trees,"['Kim, J', 'Larget, B']",BIOMETRICS,10.1111/biom.12169,SEP 2014,0,"Phylogeography investigates the historical process that is responsible for the contemporary geographic distributions of populations in a species. The inference is made on the basis of molecular sequence data sampled from modern-day populations. The estimates, however, may fluctuate depending on the relevant genomic regions, because the evolution mechanism of each genome is unique, even within the same individual. In this article, we propose a genome-differentiated population tree model that allows the existence of separate population trees for each homologous genome. In each population tree, the unique evolutionary characteristics account for each genome, along with their homologous relationship; therefore, the approach can distinguish the evolutionary history of one genome from that of another. In addition to the separate divergence times, the new model can estimate separate effective population sizes, gene-genealogies and other mutation parameters. For Bayesian inference, we developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology with a novel MCMC algorithm which can mix over a complicated state space. The stability of the new estimator is demonstrated through comparison with the Monte Carlo samples and other methods, as well as MCMC convergence diagnostics. The analysis of African gorilla data from two homologous loci reveals discordant divergence times between loci, and this discrepancy is explained by male-mediated gene flows until the end of the last ice age."

Reproduction events, such ovarian cyclicity and pregnancy, were monitored using behavior and fecal progestagen metabolite (FPM; female) and fecal androgen metabolite (FAM; male) analyses. Mean (+/- standard error) FGM concentrations for the male were elevated (P = 0.002) during the introduction (20.61 +/- 0.83 ng/g) compared to the pre- and post-introduction phases (11.31 +/- 0.48 ng/g and 12.42 +/- 0.65 ng/g, respectively). For the female, mean FGM concentrations were lower (P < 0.001) during the post-introduction (17.91 +/- 1.07 ng/g) than during the pre-and introduction phases (30.50 +/- 3.42 and 27.38 +/- 1.51 ng/g, respectively). The female maintained normal FPM cyclicity throughout the study and became pregnant in the post-introduction phase. These results suggest the importance of both behavioral and physiological monitoring of zoo animals and demonstrate the potential stress that can occur during social introductions.

Nutrition of The Captive Western Lowland Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla): A Dietary Survey,"['Smith, BK', 'Remis, MJ', 'Dierenfeld, ES']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21158,SEP-OCT 2014,0,"The successful management of captive animals requires attention to multiple interconnected factors. One critical aspect of the daily life of a captive animal is the recommended and/or provisioned diet. This study focuses on the diets of zoo-housed gorillas. A national survey of diets among zoo-housed gorillas was conducted to examine diets being offered to captive gorillas in the United States and Canada. This survey serves as a follow-up to a 1995 dietary survey of zoo-housed gorillas and goes further to quantify nutritional profiles at responding institutions. Results are encouraging, as zoos have made clear improvements in dietary nutrient profiles offered over the past 15 years. However, we suggest that zoological and sanctuary institutions follow Gorilla Species Survival Plan (SSP) recommendations and work to continuously improve diets provided, which could improve gorillas' health and well-being.

The Birth of an Infant Decreases Group Spacing in a Zoo-Housed Lowland Gorilla Group (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Kurtycz, LM', 'Shender, MA', 'Ross, SR']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21156,SEP-OCT 2014,1,"Changes in group composition can alter the behavior of social animals such as gorillas. Although gorilla births are presumed to affect group spacing patterns, there is relatively little data about how these events affect gorilla group cohesion. We investigated how members of a western lowland gorilla group (n = 6) at Lincoln Park Zoo (Chicago, IL, USA) spaced themselves prior to and after the birth of an infant, to investigate changes in group cohesion. Gorillas were housed in an indoor-outdoor enclosure in which access to the outdoors was permitted when temperatures exceeded 5 degrees C. We recorded spatial locations of each group member using 30-min group scans on tablet computers with an electronic map interface, as well as noting their access to outdoor areas. Data from the 4 months following the birth was compared to a control period corresponding to early pregnancy. We measured distances between all possible group dyads for each scan and subsequently calculated a mean distance between all group members. An ANOVA revealed that access to the outdoors had no effect on group spacing (F(1,56) = 0.066, P = 0.799). However, the presence of an infant resulted in a significant reduction in inter-individual distance (F(1,56) = 23.988, P = 0.000), decreasing inter-individual spacing by 12.5%. This information helps characterize the behavioral impact of a new birth on captive gorilla social structure and could potentially inform future management of breeding gorilla groups.

A New Approach for Monitoring Ebolavirus in Wild Great Apes,"['Reed, PE', 'Mulangu, S', 'Cameron, KN', 'Ondzie, AU', 'Joly, D', 'Bermejo, M', 'Rouquet, P', 'Fabozzi, G', 'Bailey, M', 'Shen, ZM', 'Keele, BF', 'Hahn, B', 'Karesh, WB', 'Sullivan, NJ']",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,10.1371/journal.pntd.0003143,SEP 2014,3,"Background: Central Africa is a ""hotspot"" for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of global and local importance, and a current outbreak of ebolavirus is affecting multiple countries simultaneously. Ebolavirus is suspected to have caused recent declines in resident great apes. While ebolavirus vaccines have been proposed as an intervention to protect apes, their effectiveness would be improved if we could diagnostically confirm Ebola virus disease (EVD) as the cause of die-offs, establish ebolavirus geographical distribution, identify immunologically naive populations, and determine whether apes survive virus exposure.

Methodology/Principal findings: Here we report the first successful noninvasive detection of antibodies against Ebola virus (EBOV) from wild ape feces. Using this method, we have been able to identify gorillas with antibodies to EBOV with an overall prevalence rate reaching 10% on average, demonstrating that EBOV exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in this species. Furthermore, evidence of antibodies was identified in gorillas thought previously to be unexposed to EBOV (protected from exposure by rivers as topological barriers of transmission).

Conclusions/Significance: Our new approach will contribute to a strategy to protect apes from future EBOV infections by early detection of increased incidence of exposure, by identifying immunologically naive at-risk populations as potential targets for vaccination, and by providing a means to track vaccine efficacy if such intervention is deemed appropriate. Finally, since human EVD is linked to contact with infected wildlife carcasses, efforts aimed at identifying great ape outbreaks could have a profound impact on public health in local communities, where EBOV causes case-fatality rates of up to 88%."

Landscape features such as rivers may influence genetic population structure, and analysis of structure by sex can further reveal effects of sex-specific dispersal. Using microsatellite genotypes obtained from noninvasively collected fecal samples we investigated the population structure of 261 western lowland gorillas (WLGs) (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from seven locations spanning an approximately 37,000 km(2) region of mainly continuous rain forest within Central African Republic (CAR), Republic of Congo and Cameroon. We found our sample to consist of two or three significantly differentiated clusters. The boundaries of the clusters coincided with courses of major rivers. Moreover, geographic distance detoured around rivers better-explained variation in genetic distance than straight line distance. Together these results suggest that major rivers in our study area play an important role in directing WLG gene flow. The number of clusters did not change when males and females were analyzed separately, indicating a lack of greater philopatry in WLG females than males at this scale.

Naturalistic Exhibits May be More Effective Than Traditional Exhibits at Improving Zoo-Visitor Attitudes toward African Apes,"['Lukas, KE', 'Ross, SR']",ANTHROZOOS,10.2752/175303714X14023922797904,SEP 2014,0,"Zoos play a unique role in wildlife conservation, particularly in the area of conservation education. Because of their popularity and flagship status for broader conservation issues, great apes may prove to be one of the most important educational conduits in zoos. In 2002, we surveyed knowledge of and attitudes toward African apes in visitors to the Lester E. Fisher Great Ape House (GAH) at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, IL, USA. In the current study, we replicated the survey to document attitudes to and knowledge of the newly renovated and naturalistic Regenstein Center for African Apes (RCAA) and compared results. We found RCAA was no more effective than GAH in increasing visitor knowledge about apes, although visitors answered more questions correctly upon exit than on entrance in both buildings. We did find, however, that RCAA was more effective than GAH at improving visitor attitudes toward chimpanzees. Specifically, upon exiting, RCAA visitors showed increased naturalistic attitudes and reduced utilitarian attitudes toward chimpanzees. Exhibiting apes in naturalistic settings may therefore be an effective way to increase visitor concern for apes in nature and in zoos. Zoos and aquariums investing in new, naturalistic ape exhibits with the aim to educate about, provide emotional connections to, improve attitudes toward, and ultimately increase conservation of apes, need to then critically evaluate whether the actual effect of the designed environment on visitors-above and beyond intended benefits for the animals-is commensurate with the investment. The broader impacts of even small shifts in visitor attitude in the right direction could be significant. These findings may vary across species and settings, however, and should be assessed accordingly."

Dogs learn to solve the support problem based on perceptual cues,"['Muller, CA', 'Riemer, S', 'Viranyi, Z', 'Huber, L', 'Range, F', 'CAUSAL']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-014-0739-y,SEP 2014,3,"Numerous recent studies have investigated how animals solve means-end tasks and unraveled considerable variation in strategies used by different species. Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have typically performed comparably poorly in physical cognition tasks, but a recent study showed that they can solve the on-off condition of the support problem, where they are confronted with two boards, one with a reward placed on it and the other with a reward placed next to it. To explore which strategies dogs use to solve this task, we first tested 37 dogs with the on-off condition tested previously and then tested subjects that passed this condition with three transfer tasks. For the contact condition, the inaccessible reward was touching the second board. For the perceptual containment condition, the inaccessible reward was surrounded on three sides by the second board, but not supported by it, whereas for the gap condition, discontinuous boards were used. Unlike in the previous study, our subjects did not perform above chance level in the initial trials of the on-off condition, but 13 subjects learned to solve it. Their performance in the transfer tasks suggests that dogs can learn to solve the support problem based on perceptual cues, that they can quickly adopt new cues when old ones become unreliable, but also that some apparently inherent preferences are hard to overcome. Our study contributes to accumulating evidence demonstrating that animals typically rely on a variety of perceptual cues to solve physical cognition tasks, without developing an understanding of the underlying causal structure."

Coupled with the potential advantages of identifying specific members of one's species and mounting evidence for individual recognition in other non-humans, it seems likely that great apes would have the ability to identify conspecifics in photographs. The ability of four orangutans and a gorilla to match images of individuals of their own and a closely related but unfamiliar species was examined here for the first time. First, the subjects matched photographs of familiar conspecifics taken at various time points in a delayed matching-to-sample procedure (Experiment 1). Second, they matched different photographs of unfamiliar individuals of a different species (Experiment 2) at above chance levels. These results suggest that the subjects matched photographs by matching physical features, not necessarily by recognizing the identity of the individuals depicted. However, they also quickly learned to select photographs of familiar individuals when these photographs were paired with photographs of unfamiliar individuals of their own species (Experiment 3), and three subjects showed transfer to novel images of familiar and unfamiliar individuals. Thus, the findings support the idea that subjects attended to physical features to identify individuals that they could categorize on the basis of familiarity."
A reversed-reward contingency task reveals causal knowledge in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Albiach-Serrano, A', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-014-0749-9,SEP 2014,2,"In the reversed-reward contingency task, subjects are required to choose the less preferred of two options in order to obtain the more preferred one. Usually, this task is used to measure inhibitory skills, but it could also be used to measure how strong the subjects' preferences are. We presented chimpanzees with support tasks where only one of two paper strips could physically bring food into reach. Subjects were rewarded for choosing the non-functional strip. In Experiment 1, subjects failed to pick the non-baited strip. In Experiment 2, subjects failed to pick the broken strip. Chimpanzees performed worse in these tasks than in other similar tasks where instead of paper strips, there were similar shapes painted on a platform. The fact that subjects found the reversed-reward contingency task based on causality more difficult to solve than a perceptually similar task with no causality involved (i.e., arbitrary) suggests that they did not treat real strips as an arbitrary task. Instead, they must have had some causal knowledge of the support problem that made them prefer functional over non-functional strips despite the contrary reward regime."
The Arena System: a novel shared touch-panel apparatus for the study of chimpanzee social interaction and cognition,"['Martin, CF', 'Biro, D', 'Matsuzawa, T']",BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS,10.3758/s13428-013-0418-y,SEP 2014,1,"We report on the development of a novel shared touch-panel apparatus for examining a diverse range of topics in great ape social cognition and interaction. Our apparatus-named the Arena System-is composed of a single multitouch monitor that spans across two separate testing booths, so that individuals situated in each booth have tactile access to half of the monitor and visual access to the whole monitor. Additional components of the system include a smart-film barrier able to restrict visual access between the booths, as well as two automated feeding devices that dispense food rewards to the subjects. The touch-panel, smart-film, and feeders are controlled by a PC that is also responsible for running the experimental tasks. We present data from a pilot behavioral game theory study with two chimpanzees in order to illustrate the efficacy of our method, and we suggest applications for a range of topics including animal social learning, coordination, and behavioral economics. The system enables fully automated experimental procedures, which means that no human participation is needed to run the tasks. The novel use of a touch-panel in a social setting allows for a finer degree of data resolution than do the traditional experimental apparatuses used in prior studies on great ape social interaction."
Personality and Subjective Well-Being in Captive Male Western Lowland Gorillas Living in Bachelor Groups,"['Schaefer, SA', 'Steklis, HD']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22275,SEP 2014,3,"The purpose of this study was to determine the personality structure of eight male gorillas (five silverbacks and three blackbacks) housed at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas and to determine if personality predicts behavior and subjective well-being in male gorillas living in bachelor groups. We used the Hominoid Personality Questionnaire which contains 54 descriptive adjectives with representative items from the human five-factor model. Rates of 12 behaviors that are broadly defined as agonistic or affiliative were independently recorded and calculated. Principal components analysis yielded three reliable personality factors: Dominance, Extraversion/Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. These results are the first potential quantitative evidence for a Conscientiousness factor in a hominoid other than chimpanzees and humans. This suggests that Conscientiousness originated with the common ancestor of male gorillas and humans around 10 million years ago. These results indicate that humans can reliably assess the personality and subjective well-being of captive male gorillas living in bachelor groups with robust levels of inter-rater reliability and validity. Furthermore, personality can accurately predict behavior (r = 0.79; n = 13) and subjective well-being (r = 0.83; n = 5) in gorillas and provide convergent and discriminant validity for the personality factors. The results advocate for the use of personality questionnaires in the captive management of bachelor gorillas over long-term multi-institutional behavioral studies. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
The Use of a Displacement Device Negatively Affects the Performance of Dogs (Canis familiaris) in Visible Object Displacement Tasks,"['Muller, CA', 'Riemer, S', 'Range, F', 'Huber, L']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0036032,AUG 2014,0,"Visible and invisible displacement tasks have been used widely for comparative studies of animals' understanding of object permanence, with evidence accumulating that some species can solve invisible displacement tasks and, thus, reach Piagetian stage 6 of object permanence. In contrast, dogs appear to rely on associative cues, such as the location of the displacement device, during invisible displacement tasks. It remains unclear, however, whether dogs, and other species that failed in invisible displacement tasks, do so because of their inability to form a mental representation of the target object, or simply because of the involvement of a more salient but potentially misleading associative cue, the displacement device. Here we show that the use of a displacement device impairs the performance of dogs also in visible displacement tasks: their search accuracy was significantly lower when a visible displacement was performed with a displacement device, and only two of initially 42 dogs passed the sham-baiting control conditions. The negative influence of the displacement device in visible displacement tasks may be explained by strong associative cues overriding explicit information about the target object's location, reminiscent of an overshadowing effect, and/or object individuation errors as the target object is placed within the displacement device and moves along a spatiotemporally identical trajectory. Our data suggest that a comprehensive appraisal of a species' performance in object permanence tasks should include visible displacement tasks with the same displacement device used in invisible displacements, which typically has not been done in the past."
Social Environment Elicits Lateralized Behaviors in Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Quaresmini, C', 'Forrester, GS', 'Spiezio, C', 'Vallortigara, G']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0036355,AUG 2014,7,"The influence of the social environment on lateralized behaviors has now been investigated across a wide variety of animal species. New evidence suggests that the social environment can modulate behavior. Currently, there is a paucity of data relating to how primates navigate their environmental space, and investigations that consider the naturalistic context of the individual are few and fragmented. Moreover, there are competing theories about whether only the right or rather both cerebral hemispheres are involved in the processing of social stimuli, especially in emotion processing. Here we provide the first report of lateralized social behaviors elicited by great apes. We employed a continuous focal animal sampling method to record the spontaneous interactions of a captive zoo-living colony of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and a biological family group of peer-reared western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). We specifically focused on which side of the body (i.e., front, rear, left, right) the focal individual preferred to keep conspecifics. Utilizing a newly developed quantitative corpus-coding scheme, analysis revealed both chimpanzees and gorillas demonstrated a significant group-level preference for focal individuals to keep conspecifics positioned to the front of them compared with behind them. More interestingly, both groups also manifested a population-level bias to keep conspecifics on their left side compared with their right side. Our findings suggest a social processing dominance of the right hemisphere for context-specific social environments. Results are discussed in light of the evolutionary adaptive value of social stimulus as a triggering factor for the manifestation of group-level lateralized behaviors."
Distinguishing ecological constraints from human activity in species range fragmentation: the case of Cross River gorillas,"['Imong, I', 'Robbins, MM', 'Mundry, R', 'Bergl, R', 'Kuhl, HS']",ANIMAL CONSERVATION,10.1111/acv.12100,AUG 2014,2,"The geographic range of many species has been reduced and fragmented by human impact, and ever more species live in human-dominated landscapes where they are confined to small and often suboptimal refuge areas. A detailed understanding of the causation of species' persistence and disappearance is crucial to inform management of which interventions are likely to be most effective. Yet this information is often not available to decision makers and may, in the worst case, lead to erroneous management decisions. To clarify whether Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli (CRG) occurrence is restricted due to ecological constraints or human disturbance, we collected extensive field data on food availability, habitat structure, human activity and wildlife abundance, which we related to CRG occurrence. We also related spatial variation in hunting pressure to human density, household forest use and topography. Our results clearly show that CRG are currently confined to refuge areas because of ongoing detrimental human activities and not because of lack of food resources. Current hunting pressure is driven by human population pressure, accessibility and socioeconomic conditions influencing household dependence on forest. A substantial amount of ecologically suitable but currently unoccupied habitat could potentially carry a much larger CRG population. Conservation management should therefore focus on reducing hunting and disturbance of CRG. In contrast, ecological restoration would not improve CRG living conditions. Our field and analytical approach is widely applicable to the rapidly increasing number of species inhabiting heavily human-influenced landscapes for identifying appropriate management interventions for their protection."
The Interpretive Power of Infraorbital Foramen Area in Making Dietary Inferences in Extant Apes,"['Muchlinski, MN', 'Deane, AS']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.22953,AUG 2014,1,"The infraorbital foramen (IOF) is located below the orbit and transmits the sensory infraorbital nerve (ION) to mechanoreceptors located throughout the maxillary region. The size of the IOF correlates with the size of the ION; thus, the IOF appears to indicate relative touch sensitivity of maxillary region. In primates, IOF size correlates well with diet. Frugivores have relatively larger IOFs than folivores or insectivores because fruit handling/processing requires increased touch sensitivity. However, it is unknown if the IOF can be used to detect subtle dietary differences among closely related hominoid species. Hominoids are traditionally grouped into broad dietary categories, despite the fact that hominoid diets are remarkably diverse. This study examines whether relative IOF size is capable of differentiating among the dietary preferences of closely related species with overlapping, yet divergent diets. We measured IOF area in Hylobates lar, Symphalangus syndactulus, Pongo pygmaeus spp., Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Gorilla beringei graueri, and Gorilla beringei beringei. We classified each species as a dedicated folivore, mixed folivore/frugivore, soft object frugivore, or hard object frugivore. The IOF is documented to be larger in more frugivorous species and smaller in more folivorous taxa. Interestingly, G.b. beringei, had the largest relative IOF of any gorilla, despite being a dedicated folivore. G.b. beringei does have unique food processing behavior that relies heavily on maxillary mechanoreception, thus this finding is not entirely unsupported behaviorally. The results of this study provide evidence that the IOF is an informative feature in interpretations of fossil apes. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Mountain Gorilla Ranging Patterns: Influence of Group Size and Group Dynamics,"['Caillaud, D', 'Ndagijimana, F', 'Giarrusso, AJ', 'Vecellio, V', 'Stoinski, TS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22265,AUG 2014,6,"Since the 1980s, the Virunga mountain gorilla population has almost doubled, now reaching 480 individuals living in a 430-km(2) protected area. Analysis of the gorillas' ranging patterns can provide critical information on the extent and possible effects of competition for food and space. We analyzed 12 years of daily ranging data and inter-group encounter data collected on 11 gorilla groups monitored by the Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda. During that period, the study population increased in size by almost 50% and the number of groups tripled. Groups had small yearly home ranges compared to other known gorilla populations, with an average 90% kernel density estimate of 8.07 km(2) and large between-group variations (3.17-23.59 km(2)). Most groups had consistent home range location over the course of the study but for some, we observed gradual range shifts of up to 4 km. Neighboring groups displayed high home range overlap, which increased dramatically after the formation of new groups. On average, each group used only 28.6% of its 90% kernel home range exclusively, and in some areas up to six different groups had overlapping home ranges with little or no exclusive areas. We found a significant intra-group positive relationship between the number of weaned individuals in a group and the home range size, but the fitted models only explained 17.5% and 13.7% of the variance in 50% and 90% kernel home range size estimates, respectively. This suggests that despite the increase in size, the study population is not yet experiencing marked effects of feeding competition. However, the increase in home range overlap resulting from the formation of new groups led to a sixfold increase in the frequency of inter-group encounters, which exposes the population to elevated risks of fight-related injuries and infanticide.

Niche Partitioning in Sympatric Gorilla and Pan from Cameroon: Implications for Life History Strategies and for Reconstructing the Evolution of Hominin Life History,"['Macho, GA', 'Lee-Thorp, JA']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0102794,JUL 23 2014,2,"Factors influencing the hominoid life histories are poorly understood, and little is known about how ecological conditions modulate the pace of their development. Yet our limited understanding of these interactions underpins life history interpretations in extinct hominins. Here we determined the synchronisation of dental mineralization/eruption with brain size in a 20th century museum collection of sympatric Gorilla gorilla and Pan troglodytes from Central Cameroon. Using delta C-13 and delta N-15 of individuals' hair, we assessed whether and how differences in diet and habitat use may have impacted on ape development. The results show that, overall, gorilla hair delta C-13 and delta N-15 values are more variable than those of chimpanzees, and that gorillas are consistently lower in delta C-13 and delta N-15 compared to chimpanzees. Within a restricted, isotopically-constrained area, gorilla brain development appears delayed relative to dental mineralization/eruption [or dental development is accelerated relative to brains]: only about 87.8% of adult brain size is attained by the time first permanent molars come into occlusion, whereas it is 92.3% in chimpanzees. Even when M1s are already in full functional occlusion, gorilla brains lag behind those of chimpanzee (91% versus 96.4%), relative to tooth development. Both bootstrap analyses and stable isotope results confirm that these results are unlikely due to sampling error. Rather, delta N-15 values imply that gorillas are not fully weaned (physiologically mature) until well after M1 are in full functional occlusion. In chimpanzees the transition from infant to adult feeding appears (a) more gradual and (b) earlier relative to somatic development. Taken together, the findings are consistent with life history theory that predicts delayed development when non-density dependent mortality is low, i.e. in closed habitats, and with the ""risk aversion'' hypothesis for frugivorous species as a means to avert starvation. Furthermore, the results highlight the complexity and plasticity of hominoid/hominin development."
Will Oil Palm's Homecoming Spell Doom for Africa's Great Apes?,"['Wich, SA', 'Garcia-Ulloa, J', 'Kuhl, HS', 'Humle, T', 'Lee, JSH', 'Koh, LP']",CURRENT BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cub.2014.05.077,JUL 21 2014,5,"Expansion of oil palm plantations has led to extensive wildlife habitat conversion in Southeast Asia [1]. This expansion is driven by a global demand for palm oil for products ranging from foods to detergents [2], and more recently for biofuels [3]. The negative impacts of oil palm development on biodiversity [1, 4, 5], and on orangutans (Pongo spp.) in particular, have been well documented [6, 7] and publicized [8, 9]. Although the oil palm is of African origin, Africa's production historically lags behind that of Southeast Asia. Recently, significant investments have been made that will likely drive the expansion of Africa's oil palm industry [10]. There is concern that this will lead to biodiversity losses similar to those in Southeast Asia. Here, we analyze the potential impact of oil palm development on Africa's great apes. Current great ape distribution in Africa substantially overlaps with current oil palm concessions (by 58.7%) and areas suitable for oil palm production (by 42.3%). More importantly, 39.9% of the distribution of great ape species on unprotected lands overlaps with suitable oil palm areas. There is an urgent need to develop guidelines for the expansion of oil palm in Africa to minimize the negative effects on apes and other wildlife. There is also a need for research to support land use decisions to reconcile economic development, great ape conservation, and avoiding carbon emissions."
Individual Distinctiveness in Call Types of Wild Western Female Gorillas,"['Salmi, R', 'Hammerschmidt, K', 'Doran-Sheehy, DM']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0101940,JUL 16 2014,1,"Individually distinct vocalizations play an important role in animal communication, allowing call recipients to respond differentially based on caller identity. However, which of the many calls in a species' repertoire should have more acoustic variability and be more recognizable is less apparent. One proposed hypothesis is that calls used over long distances should be more distinct because visual cues are not available to identify the caller. An alternative hypothesis proposes that close calls should be more recognizable because of their importance in social interactions. To examine which hypothesis garners more support, the acoustic variation and individual distinctiveness of eight call types of six wild western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) females were investigated. Acoustic recordings of gorilla calls were collected at the Mondika Research Center (Republic of Congo). Acoustic variability was high in all gorilla calls. Similar high inter-individual variation and potential for identity coding (PIC) was found for all call types. Discriminant function analyses confirmed that all call types were individually distinct (although for call types with lowest sample size - hum, grumble and scream - this result cannot be generalized), suggesting that neither the distance at which communication occurs nor the call social function alone can explain the evolution of identity signaling in western gorilla communication."

We investigated antimicrobial resistance in gastrointestinal Enterobacteriaceae of wild mammals and people living within Dzangha-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic, with an emphasis on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. We compare resistance genes found in microbiota of humans, gorillas habituated and unhabituated to humans and other wildlife. In gorillas, we additionally investigate the presence of ESBL resistant isolates after treatment by ceftiofur. We found a considerable prevalence of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates with ESBL and PMQR genes in humans (10% and 31%, respectively). Among wildlife the most significant findings were CTX-M-15-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in a habituated gorilla and a multiresistant Escherichia coli isolate with gene qepA in an unhabituated gorilla. Other isolates from wildlife were mostly represented by qnrB-harboring Citrobacter spp. The relatedness of resistant E. coli was investigated in a PFGE-based dendrogram; isolates from gorillas showed less than 80% similarity to each other and less than 80% similarity to human isolates. No ESBL-producing isolates were found in animals treated by ceftiofur. Although we did not detect any bacterial clone common to wildlife and humans, we detected an intersection in the spectrum of resistance genes found in humans and gorillas, represented by bla(CTX-M-15) and qepA.

Wild Western Lowland Gorillas Signal Selectively Using Odor,"['Klailova, M', 'Lee, PC']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0099554,JUL 9 2014,4,"Mammals communicate socially through visual, auditory and chemical signals. The chemical sense is the oldest sense and is shared by all organisms including bacteria. Despite mounting evidence for social chemo-signaling in humans, the extent to which it modulates behavior is debated and can benefit from comparative models of closely related hominoids. The use of odor cues in wild ape social communication has been only rarely explored. Apart from one study on wild chimpanzee sniffing, our understanding is limited to anecdotes. We present the first study of wild gorilla chemo-communication and the first analysis of olfactory signaling in relation to arousal levels and odor strength in wild apes. If gorilla scent is used as a signaling mechanism instead of only a sign of arousal or stress, odor emission should be context specific and capable of variation as a function of the relationships between the emitter and perceiver(s). Measured through a human pungency scale, we determined the factors that predicted extreme levels of silverback odor for one wild western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) group silverback. Extreme silverback odor was predicted by the presence and intensity of inter-unit interactions, silverback anger, distress and long-calling auditory rates, and the absence of close proximity between the silverback and mother of the youngest infant. Odor strength also varied according to the focal silverback's strategic responses during high intensity inter-unit interactions. Silverbacks appear to use odor as a modifiable form of communication; where odor acts as a highly flexible, context dependent signaling mechanism to group members and extragroup units. The importance of olfaction to ape social communication may be especially pertinent in Central African forests where limited visibility may necessitate increased reliance on other senses."
"Food dropping as a food transfer mechanism among western lowland gorillas in Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon","['Iwata, Y']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-014-0417-3,JUL 2014,0,"In this paper, I describe the food-dropping behavior of western lowland gorillas observed in Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon. I collected observational data of gorillas eating in trees, and recorded whether any individuals were positioned under the same tree. In 22 of the 24 cases of individuals being present under a tree, I observed the gorilla in a tree dropping food to the individual below. In most cases, the recipient was a silverback or an elder half-sibling of the dropper. The dropper's elder full-sibling was never a recipient. The food-dropping behavior of Moukalaba western lowland gorillas is likely due to a combination of factors: their frugivory, arboreality, large body size, and the scarcity of terrestrial herbs. It is difficult for multiple gorillas to simultaneously feed in the same tree. Under such limitations, younger gorillas face difficulties in defending their feeding patches from older individuals. Nearly 90 % of the recipients were older than the food droppers. Furthermore, food droppers were significantly younger than non-food droppers who simultaneously fed on the same tree, and most-food recipients were significantly older than least-food recipients on the ground. Food dropping may, therefore, be a tactic employed by younger gorillas to defend a feeding site from older individuals. This study suggests that food dropping may reduce feeding contest competition in a gorilla group in Moukalaba. This is a preliminary study that indicates that food dropping may be intentionally used as a way to reduce feeding competition; nevertheless, further studies are needed."
Characterization of Enteroviruses from Non-Human Primates in Cameroon Revealed Virus Types Widespread in Humans along with Candidate New Types and Species,"['Sadeuh-Mba, SA', 'Bessaud, M', 'Joffret, ML', 'Zanga, MCE', 'Balanant, J', 'Ngole, EM', 'Njouom, R', 'Reynes, JM', 'Delpeyroux, F', 'Rousset, D']",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,10.1371/journal.pntd.0003052,JUL 2014,3,"Enteroviruses (EVs) infecting African Non-Human Primates (NHP) are still poorly documented. This study was designed to characterize the genetic diversity of EVs among captive and wild NHP in Cameroon and to compare this diversity with that found in humans. Stool specimens were collected in April 2008 in NHP housed in sanctuaries in Yaounde and neighborhoods. Moreover, stool specimens collected from wild NHP from June 2006 to October 2008 in the southern rain forest of Cameroon were considered. RNAs purified directly from stool samples were screened for EVs using a sensitive RT-nested PCR targeting the VP1 capsid coding gene whose nucleotide sequence was used for molecular typing. Captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) were primarily infected by EV types already reported in humans in Cameroon and elsewhere: Coxsackievirus A13 and A24, Echovirus 15 and 29, and EV-B82. Moreover EV-A119, a novel virus type recently described in humans in central and west Africa, was also found in a captive Chimpanzee. EV-A76, which is a widespread virus in humans, was identified in wild chimpanzees, thus suggesting its adaptation and parallel circulation in human and NHP populations in Cameroon. Interestingly, some EVs harbored by wild NHP were genetically distinct from all existing types and were thus assigned as new types. One chimpanzee-derived virus was tentatively assigned as EV-J121 in the EV-J species. In addition, two EVs from wild monkeys provisionally registered as EV-122 and EV-123 were found to belong to a candidate new species. Overall, this study indicates that the genetic diversity of EVs among NHP is more important than previously known and could be the source of future new emerging human viral diseases."
Fatal Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy in 2 Related Subadult Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Tong, LJ', 'Flach, EJ', 'Sheppard, MN', 'Pocknell, A', 'Banerjee, AA', 'Boswood, A', 'Bouts, T', 'Routh, A', 'Feltrer, Y']",VETERINARY PATHOLOGY,10.1177/0300985813501333,JUL 2014,0,"Cardiovascular disease is increasingly recognized as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). This report records 2 cases of sudden cardiac death in closely related subadult captive chimpanzees with marked replacement fibrosis and adipocyte infiltration of the myocardium, which resemble specific atypical forms of the familial human disease arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Changes were consistent with left-dominant and biventricular sub-types, which are both phenotypic variants found within human families with familial arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Previously reported fibrosing cardiomyopathies in chimpanzees were characterized by nonspecific interstitial fibrosis, in contrast to the replacement fibrofatty infiltration with predilection for the outer myocardium seen in these 2 cases. To the authors' knowledge, this case report is the first to describe cardiomyopathy resembling arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy in nonhuman primates and the first to describe left-dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy-type lesions in an animal."
The Choice to Access Outdoor Areas Affects the Behavior of Great Apes,"['Kurtycz, LM', 'Wagner, KE', 'Ross, SR']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,10.1080/10888705.2014.896213,JUL-SEP 2014,1,"Outdoor access is often cited as a critical component of appropriate housing for great apes in captivity, and although studies have shown that offering primates choices can improve welfare, choice to access specific areas has been empirically neglected. Behavioral data were collected on chimpanzees and gorillas housed in naturalistic enclosures while (a) restricted to an indoor enclosure and (b) permitted free access to an adjacent outdoor area. To isolate the factor of choice, only the sessions in which apes remained indoors were compared. With choice, chimpanzees showed more frequent social, F(1, 5) = 20.526, p = .006, and self-directed behaviors, F(1, 5) = 13.507, p = .014, and lower inactivity levels, F(1, 5) = 9.239, p = .029. Gorillas were more frequently inactive, F(1, 8) = 22.259, p = .002, and produced lower levels of object manipulation, F(1, 8) = 8.243, p = .021, and feeding, F(1, 8) = 5.407, p = .049. Results are consistent with an association between choice and the expression of species-typical and arousal behaviors in chimpanzees. The effects are less evident in gorillas, but this outcome may be buffered by the species' lower motivation to utilize the outdoor spaces. Findings highlight species-specific reactions to access to choice that may offer insight for enclosure design, management, and nonhuman animal welfare."
Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) map number onto space,"['Drucker, CB', 'Brannon, EM']",COGNITION,10.1016/j.cognition.2014.03.011,JUL 2014,10,"Humans map number onto space. However, the origins of this association, and particularly the degree to which it depends upon cultural experience, are not fully understood. Here we provide the first demonstration of a number-space mapping in a non-human primate. We trained four adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to select the fourth position from the bottom of a five-element vertical array. Monkeys maintained a preference to choose the fourth position through changes in the appearance, location, and spacing of the vertical array. We next asked whether monkeys show a spatially-oriented number mapping by testing their responses to the same five-element stimulus array rotated ninety degrees into a horizontal line. In these horizontal probe trials, monkeys preferentially selected the fourth position from the left, but not the fourth position from the right. Our results indicate that rhesus macaques map number onto space, suggesting that the association between number and space in human cognition is not purely a result of cultural experience and instead has deep evolutionary roots.

"Entangled Realms: Hunters and Hunted in the Dzanga-Sangha Dense Forest Reserve.(ADPS), Central African Republic","['Robinson, CAJ', 'Remis, MJ']",ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY,NA,SUM 2014,1,"Researchers across disciplines have struggled to understand the entanglement of human-environment relationships. Nowhere are these entanglements more evident than among human communities situated within protected areas. These communities often rely on natural resources, such as wildlife, as an integral component of daily livelihoods. The success of human livelihood strategies and the continued presence of wildlife hinges upon our ability to understand inherently dependent relationships between animals and humans. Using the bushmeat trade as an entry point, this article draws on theoretical developments in anthropology, specifically mutual ecologies and data-based approaches to wildlife management, to examine relationships between hunters and hunted in the Dzanga-Sangha Dense Forest Reserve (APDS)."

"Selective insectivory at Toro-Semliki, Uganda: Comparative analyses suggest no 'savanna' chimpanzee pattern","['Webster, TH', 'McGrew, WC', 'Marchant, LF', 'Payne, CLR', 'Hunt, KD']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.02.005,JUN 2014,2,"Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) insectivory across Africa is ubiquitous. Insects provide a significant nutritional payoff and may be important for chimpanzees in dry, open habitats with narrow diets. We tested this hypothesis at Semliki, Uganda, a long-term dry study site. We evaluated prospects for insectivory by measuring insect abundance along de novo transects and trails, monitoring social insect colonies, and surveying available raw materials for elementary technology. We determined the frequency and nature of insectivory through behavioral observation and fecal analysis. We then compared our results with those from 15 other long-term chimpanzee study sites using a cluster analysis. We found that Semliki chimpanzees are one of the most insectivorous populations studied to date in terms of frequency of consumption, but they are very selective in their insectivory, regularly consuming only weaver ants (Oecophylla longinoda) and honey and bees from hives of Apis mellifera. This selectivity obtains despite having a full range of typical prey species available in harvestable quantities. We suggest that Semliki chimpanzees may face ecological time constraints and therefore bias their predation toward prey taxa that can be quickly consumed. Geographical proximity correlated with the results of the cluster analysis, while rainfall, a relatively gross measure of environment, did not. Because broad taxonomic groups of insects were used in analyses, prey availability was unlikely to have a strong effect on this pattern. Instead, we suggest that transmission of cultural knowledge may play a role in determining chimpanzee prey selection across Africa. Further study is needed to test these hypotheses.

Nutritional contributions of insects to primate diets: Implications for primate evolution,"['Rothman, JM', 'Raubenheimer, D', 'Bryer, MAH', 'Takahashi, M', 'Gilbert, CC']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.02.016,JUN 2014,8,"Insects and other invertebrates form a portion of many living and extinct primate diets. We review the nutritional profiles of insects in comparison with other dietary items, and discuss insect nutrients in relation to the nutritional needs of living primates. We find that insects are incorporated into some primate diets as staple foods whereby they are the majority of food intake. They can also be incorporated as complements to other foods in the diet, providing protein in a diet otherwise dominated by gums and/or fruits, or be incorporated as supplements to likely provide an essential nutrient that is not available in the typical diet. During times when they are very abundant, such as in insect outbreaks, insects can serve as replacements to the usual foods eaten by primates. Nutritionally, insects are high in protein and fat compared with typical dietary items like fruit and vegetation. However, insects are small in size and for larger primates (>1 kg) it is usually nutritionally profitable only to consume insects when they are available in large quantities. In small quantities, they may serve to provide important vitamins and fatty acids typically unavailable in primate diets. In a brief analysis, we found that soft-bodied insects are higher in fat though similar in chitin and protein than hard-bodied insects. In the fossil record, primates can be defined as soft- or hard-bodied insect feeders based on dental morphology. The differences in the nutritional composition of insects may have implications for understanding early primate evolution and ecology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Psychological limits on animal innovation,"['Brosnan, SF', 'Hopper, LM']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.02.026,JUN 2014,7,"Innovation is a way by which animals adopt a new behaviour or apply a current behaviour to a novel situation. Although exploring a new behaviour is itself risky for the animal, a growing body of research indicates that it is fairly widespread across animal species. While there have been explorations of when innovation is most likely and which individuals are most likely to innovate, less has been explored about the psychological mechanisms underlying innovation. Here we consider some psychological limits on innovation. We focus on five factors that my limit the invention of novel behaviours (neophobia, conservatism, conformity, functional fixedness and the endowment effect). The feature common to each of these is that individuals tend to stick with existing behaviours, or the existing uses of those behaviours, rather than exploring novel options. This in turn limits animals' willingness to try less common behaviours unless they are forced through circumstances to explore alternate strategies. Despite the similar functional outcomes, it is critical to understand the underlying mechanisms present in different situations in order to make strong predictions about when innovation is, or is not, expected to emerge. We then consider how transmission biases and social learning mechanisms influence and limit the spread of inventions among individuals. Of course, these 'limits' are beneficial in other circumstances, and throughout this review we consider the trade-offs for these psychological mechanisms.

Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (Phreatichthys andruzzii),"['Bisazza, A', 'Tagliapietra, C', 'Bertolucci, C', 'Foa, A', 'Agrillo, C', 'AUDITORY-STIMULI']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,10.1242/jeb.101683,JUN 2014,3,"Over a decade of comparative studies, researchers have found that rudimentary numerical abilities are widespread among vertebrates. While experiments in mammals and birds have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all fish studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether fish can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical abilities in Phreatichthys andruzzii, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia desert. Fish were trained to receive a food reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In Experiment 1, subjects learned to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not controlled for non-numerical continuous variables that covary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In Experiment 2, the discrimination was two versus four, with half of the stimuli controlled for continuous quantities and half not controlled for continuous quantities. The subjects discriminated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates tested in similar experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, cavefish trained from the beginning only with stimuli controlled for continuous quantities proved able to learn the discrimination of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost fish tested with visual stimuli."
The apparent enhancement of CpG transversions in primate lineage is a consequence of multiple replacements,"['Borstnik, B', 'Pumpernik, D']",JOURNAL OF BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,10.1142/S0219720014500115,JUN 2014,0,We claim that the apparently enhanced CpG transversions in the form CpG to CpC/GpG or to ApG/CpT are caused by the hypermutable CpG to CpA/TpG transition. The nucleotide replacement counts obtained from the human/chimpanzee/gorilla/orangutan sequence alignments representing the replacements due to the evolutionary species divergence and the results of 1000 genomes project that provide us with the differerences due to the intraspecies diversification were analyzed to estimate the ratio of CpG versus non-CpG transversion probabilities. The trinucleotide replacement counts were extracted from the regions that are free of functional constraints. The CpG transversion probabilities based upon the genomic comparisons were found to exceed more than twice the non-CpG transversions. The diversity data emerging from 14 population groups were partitioned in five classes as a function of the parameter quantifying the spread of the polymorphic allele among the group of individuals. The results based upon the human polymorphism exhibit a trend where CpG over non-CpG transversion probability ratio is less and less exceeding unity as the values of the derived allele frequency (DAF) of snps are diminishing. A computer simulation of a simplified model indicates that the phenomenon of the apparent enhancement of CpG transversions can have its source in the interference of the entropic effects with the maximum likelihood methodologies.
"Great Apes (Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo abelii) Follow Visual Trails to Locate Hidden Food","['Volter, CJ', 'Call, J', 'CAUSAL']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0035434,MAY 2014,0,"Whether nonhuman primates understand causal relations beyond mere associations is still a matter of debate. We presented all four species of nonhuman great apes (N = 36) with a choice between 2 opaque, upside down cups after displacing them out of sight from their starting positions. Crucially, 1 of them had left a yogurt trail behind it. Great apes spontaneously used the trail to select the yogurt baited cup. Follow-up experiments demonstrated that chimpanzees distinguished trails based on the temporal order of cause and effect by ignoring trails that were already present before the reward was hidden. Additionally, chimpanzees did not select cups based on the amount of yogurt near them but instead preferred cups that signaled the endpoint of the trail. We conclude that apes' choices reveal sensitivity to a causal relation between cause (reward) and effect (trail) including their temporal order."

Immature females from infancy to young adulthood maintained relatively frequent proximity to both their mothers and the silverback male and spent little time alone (no animals within 10 m), with relatively large individual differences. On the other hand, immature males decreased the time spent near their mothers and the silverback male and increased the time spent alone with increasing age. Therefore, sex differences in proximity to mothers and the silverback male became apparent after late juvenility. Some adult females maintained increased frequency of proximity to the silverback male than that by other females over the 12-year period, indicating the presence of long-term, stable proximity relationships between the silverback male and the adult females. Such long-term, stable proximity relationships were also observed among adult females. Some association patterns reported in wild gorillas, such as frequent proximity between adult females with dependent offspring and the silverback male and close relationships between related females, were not observed in the present study. The idiosyncratic or individual factors influencing some association patterns were easily reflected in captive situations. (C) 2014 The Authors. Zoo Biology Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
The Effects of Auditory Enrichment on Gorillas,"['Robbins, L', 'Margulis, SW']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21127,MAY-JUN 2014,2,"Several studies have demonstrated that auditory enrichment can reduce stereotypic behaviors in captive animals. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative effectiveness of three different types of auditory enrichment-naturalistic sounds, classical music, and rock music-in reducing stereotypic behavior displayed by Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Three gorillas (one adult male, two adult females) were observed at the Buffalo Zoo for a total of 24 hr per music trial. Acontrol observation period, during which no sounds were presented, was also included. Each music trial consisted of a total of three weeks with a 1-week control period in between each music type. The results reveal a decrease in stereotypic behaviors from the control period to naturalistic sounds. The naturalistic sounds also affected patterns of several other behaviors including locomotion. In contrast, stereotypy increased in the presence of classical and rock music. These results suggest that auditory enrichment, which is not commonly used in zoos in a systematic way, can be easily utilized by keepers to help decrease stereotypic behavior, but the nature of the stimulus, as well as the differential responses of individual animals, need to be considered.

Both gorillas chose the larger quantity of two arrays of dot stimuli. On some trials, the relative number of dots was congruent with the relative total area of the two arrays. On other trials, number of dots was incongruent with area. The gorillas were first tested with static dots, then with dots that moved within the arrays, and finally on a task where they were required to discriminate numerically larger subsets within arrays of moving dots. Both gorillas achieved above-chance performance on both congruent and incongruent trials with all tasks, indicating that they were able to use number as a cue even though ratio of number and area significantly controlled responding, suggesting that number was not the only relevant dimension that the gorillas used. The pattern of performance was similar to that found previously with monkeys and chimpanzees but had not previously been demonstrated in gorillas within a computerized test format, and with these kinds of visual stimuli."
Assessing reintroduction success in long-lived primates through population viability analysis: western lowland gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla in Central Africa,"['King, T', 'Chamberlan, C', 'Courage, A']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605312001391,APR 2014,1,"The use of population modelling has become an increasingly common tool in reintroduction planning and assessment. Although initial reintroduction success is often measured by quantifying post-release survival and reproduction, longer-term success is best assessed through measurements of population viability. Here we develop a population model capable of providing useful results for influencing management of a reintroduction programme for a long-lived and slow-reproducing primate, the western lowland gorilla Gorilla gorilla gorilla. We used post-release monitoring data from two reintroduced populations in the Bateke Plateau region of Congo and Gabon, complemented with published data on wild and captive populations, to develop a population model using Vortex. Sensitivity testing illustrated that the model was highly sensitive to changes in the input parameters for annual birth rates, the number of lethal equivalents, and for female annual mortality rates, especially for adults. The results of the population viability analysis suggested that the reintroduced gorilla populations have a reasonable chance of persistence (>90% over 200 years) but illustrated that reinforcement of the populations could significantly improve probabilities of population persistence and retention of genetic diversity. Equally, catastrophic events could have significant negative impacts. Continued monitoring of the populations should allow refinement of the model, improving confidence in its predictions and its relevance to decision-making."
"Effects of habituation, research and ecotourism on faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in wild western lowland gorillas: Implications for conservation management","['Shutt, K', 'Heistermann, M', 'Kasim, A', 'Todd, A', 'Kalousova, B', 'Profosouva, I', 'Petrzelkova, K', 'Fuh, T', 'Dicky, JF', 'Bopalanzognako, JB', 'Setchell, JM']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2014.02.014,APR 2014,5,"Wildlife tourism is proliferating worldwide and has the potential to raise revenue for conservation as well as public awareness of conservation issues. However, concerns are growing about the potentially negative influence of such tourism on the wildlife involved. We investigate the effects of habituation, ecotourism and research activities on levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGCMs), a proxy for physiological stress, in wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in the Central African Republic. We compare FGCMs in three human-contacted groups with those in unhabituated gorillas. We also explore how human-gorilla contact influences FGCMs of a gorilla group undergoing habituation and investigate how measures of general human-gorilla contact, tourism and human proximity influence FGCMs in recently and long-term habituated groups. Two of the three human-contacted groups had higher levels of FGCMs than unhabituated gorillas. The group undergoing habituation had the highest FGCMs, which increased up to 21 days following contacts, suggesting a cumulative FGCM response, in line with descriptions of a hormonal adaptation response to a chronic intermittent stressor. FGCMs in habituated groups were significantly associated with increasing frequency of violation of the 7 m distance rule by observers and with a medical intervention but not with other measures of human pressure. Our findings provide critical information for the management of this, and other, species whose conservation depends on habituation for ecotourism.

Autonomy in chimpanzees,"['Beauchamp, TL', 'Wobber, V']",THEORETICAL MEDICINE AND BIOETHICS,10.1007/s11017-014-9287-3,APR 2014,2,"Literature on the mental capacities and cognitive mechanisms of the great apes has been silent about whether they can act autonomously. This paper provides a philosophical theory of autonomy supported by psychological studies of the cognitive mechanisms that underlie chimpanzee behavior to argue that chimpanzees can act autonomously even though their psychological mechanisms differ from those of humans. Chimpanzees satisfy the two basic conditions of autonomy: (1) liberty (the absence of controlling influences) and (2) agency (self-initiated intentional action), each of which is specified here in terms of conditions of understanding, intention, and self-control. In this account, chimpanzees make knowledge-based choices reflecting a richly information-based and socially sophisticated understanding of the world. Finally, two major theories of autonomy (Kantian theory and two-level theory) are rejected as too narrow to adequately address these issues, necessitating the modifications made in the present approach."
"The effect of canopy closure on chimpanzee nest abundance in Lagoas de Cufada National Park, Guinea-Bissau","['Sousa, J', 'Casanova, C', 'Barata, AV', 'Sousa, C']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-013-0402-2,APR 2014,0,"The present study aimed to gather baseline information about chimpanzee nesting and density in Lagoas de Cufada Natural Park (LCNP), in Guinea-Bissau. Old and narrow trails were followed to estimate chimpanzee density through marked-nest counts and to test the effect of canopy closure (woodland savannah, forest with a sparse canopy, and forest with a dense canopy) on nest distribution. Chimpanzee abundance was estimated at 0.79 nest builders/km(2), the lowest among the areas of Guinea-Bissau with currently studied chimpanzee populations. Our data suggest that subhumid forest with a dense canopy accounts for significantly higher chimpanzee nest abundance (1.50 nests/km of trail) than sub-humid forest with a sparse canopy (0.49 nests/km of trail) or woodland savannah (0.30 nests/km of trail). Dense-canopy forests play an important role in chimpanzee nesting in the patchy and highly humanized landscape of LCNP. The tree species most frequently used for nesting are Dialium guineense (46 %) and Elaeis guineensis (28 %). E. guineensis contain nests built higher in the canopy, while D. guineense contain nests built at lower heights. Nests observed during baseline sampling and replications suggest seasonal variations in the tree species used for nest building."
Resequencing studies of nonmodel organisms using closely related reference genomes: optimal experimental designs and bioinformatics approaches for population genomics,"['Nevado, B', 'Ramos-Onsins, SE', 'Perez-Enciso, M']",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1111/mec.12693,APR 2014,9,"Decreasing costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments have made a wide range of genomic questions open for study with nonmodel organisms. However, experimental designs and analysis of NGS data from less well-known species are challenging because of the lack of genomic resources. In this work, we investigate the performance of alternative experimental designs and bioinformatics approaches in estimating variability and neutrality tests based on the site-frequency-spectrum (SFS) from individual resequencing data. We pay particular attention to challenges faced in the study of nonmodel organisms, in particular the absence of a species-specific reference genome, although phylogenetically close genomes are assumed to be available. We compare the performance of three alternative bioinformatics approaches - genotype calling, genotype-haplotype calling and direct estimation without calling genotypes. We find that relying on genotype calls provides biased estimates of population genetic statistics at low to moderate read depth (2-8x). Genotype-haplotype calling returns more accurate estimates irrespective of the divergence to the reference genome, but requires moderate depth (8-20x). Direct estimation without calling genotypes returns the most accurate estimates of variability and of most SFS tests investigated, including at low read depth (2-4x). Studies without species-specific reference genome should thus aim for low read depth and avoid genotype calling whenever individual genotypes are not essential. Otherwise, aiming for moderate to high depth at the expense of number of individuals, and using genotype-haplotype calling, is recommended."
Ancient and Recent Selective Pressures Shaped Genetic Diversity at AIM2-Like Nucleic Acid Sensors,"['Cagliani, R', 'Forni, D', 'Biasin, M', 'Comabella, M', 'Guerini, FR', 'Riva, S', 'Pozzoli, U', 'Agliardi, C', 'Caputo, D', 'Malhotra, S', 'Montalban, X', 'Bresolin, N', 'Clerici, M', 'Sironi, M']",GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/gbe/evu066,2014,8,"AIM2-like receptors (ALRs) are a family of nucleic acid sensors essential for innate immune responses against viruses and bacteria. We performed an evolutionary analysis of ALR genes (MNDA, PYHIN1, IFI16, and AIM2) by analyzing inter- and intraspecies diversity. Maximum-likelihood analyses indicated that IFI16 and AIM2 evolved adaptively in primates, with branch-specific selection at the catarrhini lineage for IFI16. Application of a population genetics-phylogenetics approach also allowed identification of positive selection events in the human lineage. Positive selection in primates targeted sites located at the DNA-binding interface in both IFI16 and AIM2. In IFI16, several sites positively selected in primates and in the human lineage were located in the PYD domain, which is involved in protein-protein interaction and is bound by a human cytomegalovirus immune evasion protein. Finally, positive selection was found to target nuclear localization signals in IFI16 and the spacer region separating the two HIN domains. Population genetic analysis in humans revealed that an IFI16 genic region has been a target of long-standing balancing selection, possibly acting on two nonsynonymous polymorphisms located in the spacer region. Data herein indicate that ALRs have been repeatedly targeted by natural selection. The balancing selection region in IFI16 carries a variant with opposite risk effect for distinct autoimmune diseases, suggesting antagonistic pleiotropy. We propose that the underlying scenario is the result of an ancestral and still ongoing host-pathogen arms race and that the maintenance of susceptibility alleles for autoimmune diseases at IFI16 represents an evolutionary trade-off."
Differences in the early cognitive development of children and great apes,"['Wobber, V', 'Herrmann, E', 'Hare, B', 'Wrangham, R', 'Tomasello, M']",DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY,10.1002/dev.21125,APR 2014,8,"There is very little research comparing great ape and human cognition developmentally. In the current studies we compared a cross-sectional sample of 2- to 4-year-old human children (n = 48) with a large sample of chimpanzees and bonobos in the same age range (n = 42, hereafter: apes) on a broad array of cognitive tasks. We then followed a group of juvenile apes (n = 44) longitudinally over 3 years to track their cognitive development in greater detail. In skills of physical cognition (space, causality, quantities), children and apes performed comparably at 2 years of age, but by 4 years of age children were more advanced (whereas apes stayed at their 2-year-old performance levels). In skills of social cognition (communication, social learning, theory of mind), children out-performed apes already at 2 years, and increased this difference even more by 4 years. Patterns of development differed more between children and apes in the social domain than the physical domain, with support for these patterns present in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal ape data sets. These results indicate key differences in the pattern and pace of cognitive development between humans and other apes, particularly in the early emergence of specific social cognitive capacities in humans.

Ecological Divergence and Talar Morphology in Gorillas,"['Dunn, RH', 'Tocheri, MW', 'Orr, CM', 'Jungers, WL', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22451,APR 2014,9,"Gorillas occupy a variety of habitats from the west coast to eastern central Africa. These habitats differ considerably in altitude, which has a pronounced effect on forest ecology. Although all gorillas are obligate terrestrial knuckle-walking quadrupeds, those that live in lowland habitats eat fruits and climb more often than do those living in highland habitats. Here we test the hypothesis that gorilla talus morphology falls along a morphocline that tracks locomotor function related to a more inverted or everted foot set. This proposed morphocline predicts that gorillas living in lowland habitats may have a talocrural joint configured to facilitate a more medially oriented foot during climbing, suggesting that they may be more adaptively committed to arboreality than gorillas living in highland habitats. To quantify the relative set of the foot in gorillas, we chose two three-dimensional measurements of the talocrural joint: mediolateral curvature of the trochlea and relative surface area of the lateral malleolus. Our results show that, in comparison to their eastern counterparts, western gorillas have talar features that reflect a more medially directed sole of the foot. This morphology likely facilitates foot placement in a wider range of positions and minimization of shearing stresses across the joint when the foot is loaded on more curved or vertically oriented substrates as occurs during climbing and other arboreal behaviors. In contrast, eastern gorilla talar morphology is consistent with habitual placement of the foot with the sole directed more inferiorly, suggesting more effective loading during plantigrade push-off on terrestrial substrates.

Many forms of such statistical reasoning have been found to develop late in human ontogeny, depending on formal education and language, and to be fragile even in adults. New revolutionary research, however, suggests that even preverbal human infants make use of intuitive statistics. Here, we conducted the first investigation of such intuitive statistical reasoning with non-human primates. In a series of 7 experiments, Bonobos, Chimpanzees, Gorillas and Orangutans drew flexible statistical inferences from populations to samples. These inferences, furthermore, were truly based on statistical information regarding the relative frequency distributions in a population, and not on absolute frequencies. Intuitive statistics in its most basic form is thus an evolutionarily more ancient rather than a uniquely human capacity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Socioecological correlates of energy balance using urinary C-peptide measurements in wild female mountain gorillas,"['Grueter, CC', 'Deschner, T', 'Behringer, V', 'Fawcett, K', 'Robbins, MM']",PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR,10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.01.009,MAR 29 2014,5,"Maintaining a balanced energy budget is important for survival and reproduction, but measuring energy balance in wild animals has been fraught with difficulties. Female mountain gorillas are interesting subjects to examine environmental correlates of energy balance because their diet is primarily herbaceous vegetation, their food supply shows little seasonal variation and is abundant, yet they live in cooler, high-altitude habitats that may bring about energetic challenges. Social and reproductive parameters may also influence energy balance. Urinary C-peptide (UCP) has emerged as a valuable non-invasive biomarker of energy balance in primates. Here we use this method to investigate factors influencing energy balance in mountain gorillas of the Virunga Volcanoes, Rwanda. We examined a range of socioecological variables on energy balance in adult females in three groups monitored by the Karisoke Research Center over nine months. Three variables had significant effects on UCP levels: habitat (highest levels in the bamboo zone), season (highest levels in November during peak of the bamboo shoot availability) and day time (gradually increasing from early morning to early afternoon). There was no significant effect of reproductive state and dominance rank. Our study indicates that even in species that inhabit an area with a seemingly steady food supply, ecological variability can have pronounced effects on female energy balance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we analyzed the insect-diet diversity of 9 feces obtained from three species of African great apes, gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and bonobo (Pan paniscus), using two mitochondrial amplifications for arthropods. A total of 1056 clones were sequenced for Cyt-b and COI gene libraries, which contained 50 and 56 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), respectively. BLAST research revealed that the OTUs belonged to 32 families from 5 orders (Diptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Orthoptera). While ants were not detected by this method, the consumption of flies, beetles, moths, mosquitoes and termites was evident in these samples.

A total of 18 staple foods that comprise 97% of the annual dietary intake of the mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei) were analyzed for fatty acid concentrations. Fruits and herbaceous leaves comprise the majority of the diet, with fruits generally having a higher mean percentage of fat (of dry matter; DM), as measured by ether extract (EE), than herbaceous leaves (13.0%+/- SD 13.0% vs. 2.3 +/- SD 0.8%). The mean daily EE intake by gorillas was 3.1% (DM). Fat provided approximate to 14% of the total dietary energy intake, and approximate to 22% of the dietary non-protein energy intake. Saturated fatty acids accounted for 32.4% of the total fatty acids in the diet, while monounsaturated fatty acids accounted for 12.5% and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) accounted for 54.6%. Both of the two essential PUFA, linoleic acid (LA, n-6) and -linolenic acid (ALA, n-3), were found in all of the 17 staple foods containing crude fat and were among the three most predominant fatty acids in the diet: LA (C18:2n-6) (30.3%), palmitic acid (C16:0) (23.9%), and ALA (C18:3n-3) (21.2%). Herbaceous leaves had higher concentrations of ALA, while fruit was higher in LA. Fruits provided high amounts of fatty acids, especially LA, in proportion to their intake due to the higher fat concentrations; despite being low in fat, herbaceous leaves provided sufficient ALA due to the high intake of these foods. As expected, we found that wild mountain gorillas consume a diet lower in EE, than modern humans. The ratio of LA:ALA was 1.44, closer to agricultural paleolithic diets than to modern human diets.

The influence of body posture on the kinematics of prehension in humans and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla),"['Reghem, E', 'Cheze, L', 'Coppens, Y', 'Pouydebat, E']",EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH,10.1007/s00221-013-3817-5,MAR 2014,0,"Much of our current understanding of human prehension in a comparative context is based on macaque models in a sitting, constrained body posture. In a previous study, we clearly showed differences in the amplitude of the forelimb joints between five primate species (lemur, capuchin, chimpanzee, gorilla and human) during unconstrained grasping where the animals were free to choose their body posture. One of our interrogations was to know if these differences could be due to the body posture. To address this question, this study compares humans with new data for gorillas during an unconstrained food prehension task in two body postures, a sitting and a quadrupedal one. The objective is to determine the behavioral and kinematic strategies (amplitudes and patterns of evolution of the articular angles) as well as differences and invariants of trunk and forelimb motions between species. The subjects were recorded by five cameras, and landmarks were digitized frame by frame to reconstruct 3D movement. Our results show that (1) despite significant influences of body postures on ranges of motion in gorillas and humans, species preserve their specific forelimb joint and trunk contribution; (2) body posture has a limited effect on the basic pattern of wrist velocity. Our study indicates that different primate species have specific kinematic features of limb coordination during prehension, which dose not alter with changes in posture. Therefore, across varying species, it is possible to compare limb kinematics irrespective of postural constraints and unconstrained condition need to be explored in other primates to understand the evolution of primate prehension."

Here, the substitution rate was confirmed to increase in the vicinity of LCRs in several primate species, including humans. This effect was also found among human sequences from the 1000 Genomes Project. A strong correlation was found between average substitution rate per site and distance from the LCR, as well as the proportion of genes with gaps in the alignment at each site and distance from the LCR. Along with substitution rates, d(N)/d(S) ratios were also determined for each site, and the proportion of sites undergoing negative selection was found to have a negative relationship with distance from the LCR."
Human evolution and tears of the rotator cuff,"['Craik, JD', 'Mallina, R', 'Ramasamy, V', 'Little, NJ']",INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS,10.1007/s00264-013-2204-y,MAR 2014,3,"Purpose Humans differ from other great ape species in their propensity to develop tears of the rotator cuff. The aim of this study was to compare the anatomical risk factors for subacromial impingement and rotator cuff tears amongst the great apes and to determine which features may be accentuated in humans and therefore play a more significant role in disease aetiology.

Methods Orthogonal digital photographs of 22 human, 17 gorilla, 13 chimpanzee and 12 orangutan dry bone scapula specimens oriented in the glenoid plane were taken. Anatomical measurements were preformed using a calibrated digital image technique and the results scaled according to scapula vertebral border length.

Results Of the ten anatomical features associated with subacromial impingement and rotator cuff tears in humans, none were shown to be accentuated and significantly different to the other species studied. However the human supraspinatus fossa was shown to be significantly smaller.

Conclusions These results indicate that an alternative primary aetiological factor for rotator cuff tears must exist. A reduction in the size of the supraspinatus fossa in human scapulae suggests that structural insufficiency of the supraspinatus or a change in rotator cuff force vectors could play a role."
Ectocranial Suture Fusion in Primates: Pattern and Phylogeny,"['Cray, J', 'Cooper, GM', 'Mooney, MP', 'Siegel, MI']",JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY,10.1002/jmor.20218,MAR 2014,2,"Patterns of ectocranial suture fusion among Primates are subject to species-specific variation. In this study, we used Guttman Scaling to compare modal progression of ectocranial suture fusion among Hominidae (Homo, Pan, Gorilla, and Pongo), Hylobates, and Cercopithecidae (Macaca and Papio) groups. Our hypothesis is that suture fusion patterns should reflect their evolutionary relationship. For the lateral-anterior suture sites there appear to be three major patterns of fusion, one shared by Homo-Pan-Gorilla, anterior to posterior; one shared by Pongo and Hylobates, superior to inferior; and one shared by Cercopithecidae, posterior to anterior. For the vault suture pattern, the Hominidae groups reflect the known phylogeny. The data for Hylobates and Cercopithecidae groups is less clear. The vault suture site termination pattern of Papio is similar to that reported for Gorilla and Pongo. Thus, it may be that some suture sites are under larger genetic influence for patterns of fusion, while others are influenced by environmental/biomechanic influences. J. Morphol. 275:342-347, 2014.

We assessed the frequency of this fusion in 56 primate species (including apes, Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, and strepsirrhines) by using either magnetic resonance images or histological sections. A fusion between temporal cortex and posterior insula was present in 22 species (seven apes, two Old World monkeys, four New World monkeys, and nine strepsirrhines). The temporoinsular fusion was observed in most eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei and G. b. graueri) specimens (62% and 100% of cases, respectively) but was seen less frequently in other great apes and was never found in humans. We further explored the histology of this fusion in eastern gorillas by examining the cyto- and myeloarchitecture within this region and observed that the degree to which deep cortical layers and white matter are incorporated into the fusion varies among individuals within a species. We suggest that fusion between temporal and insular cortex is an example of a relatively rare neuroanatomical feature that has become more common in eastern gorillas, possibly as the result of a population bottleneck effect.

The spatial arrangement of the dots and the background color of the stimuli varied, and the size of the dots was manipulated to control for overall ratio of foreground to background. The subject's performance was not affected by these perceptual features, but was affected by the absolute difference and ratio between number of elements in the comparison stimuli. However, the relationship between these variables and his performance was not always linear as predicted by the analog magnitude model. In addition, the subject showed a high degree of transfer to novel numerosities up to ten, indicating that orangutans are capable of estimating quantity for a greater number of items than can presumably be subtilized by humans."
Reverse Zoonotic Disease Transmission (Zooanthroponosis): A Systematic Review of Seldom-Documented Human Biological Threats to Animals,"['Messenger, AM', 'Barnes, AN', 'Gray, GC', 'RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0089055,FEB 28 2014,11,"Background: Research regarding zoonotic diseases often focuses on infectious diseases animals have given to humans. However, an increasing number of reports indicate that humans are transmitting pathogens to animals. Recent examples include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, influenza A virus, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Ascaris lumbricoides. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of published literature regarding reverse zoonoses and highlight the need for future work in this area.

Methods: An initial broad literature review yielded 4763 titles, of which 4704 were excluded as not meeting inclusion criteria. After careful screening, 56 articles (from 56 countries over three decades) with documented human-to-animal disease transmission were included in this report.

Findings: In these publications, 21 (38%) pathogens studied were bacterial, 16 (29%) were viral, 12 (21%) were parasitic, and 7 (13%) were fungal, other, or involved multiple pathogens. Effected animals included wildlife (n = 28, 50%), livestock (n = 24, 43%), companion animals (n = 13, 23%), and various other animals or animals not explicitly mentioned (n = 2, 4%). Published reports of reverse zoonoses transmission occurred in every continent except Antarctica therefore indicating a worldwide disease threat.

Interpretation: As we see a global increase in industrial animal production, the rapid movement of humans and animals, and the habitats of humans and wild animals intertwining with great complexity, the future promises more opportunities for humans to cause reverse zoonoses. Scientific research must be conducted in this area to provide a richer understanding of emerging and reemerging disease threats. As a result, multidisciplinary approaches such as One Health will be needed to mitigate these problems."

Eight measures of tooth cusp RoC (two RoCs per cusp) were taken from 53 M(2)s from four species and subspecies of frugivorous apes (Pongo pygmaeus, Pan troglodytes troglodytes, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, and Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and two subspecies of folivorous apes (Gorilla beringei beringei, and Gorilla beringei graueri). Phylogenetically corrected ANOVAs were run on the full dataset and several subsets of the full dataset, revealing that, when buccolingual RoCs are taken into account, tooth cusp RoCs can successfully differentiate folivores and frugivores. PCAs revealed that folivores consistently had duller teeth than frugivores. In addition, a weak, statistically significant positive correlation exists between tooth cusp size and tooth cusp RoC. The author hypothesizes differences in tooth cusp RoC are correlated with wear rates, where, per vertical unit of wear, duller cusps will have a longer length of exposed enamel ridge than sharper cusps. More data need to be gathered to determine if the correlation between tooth cusp RoC and tooth cusp size holds true when small primates are considered. Am J Phys Anthropol 153:226-235, 2014.

Monitoring Ovarian Cycle Activity Via Progestagens in Urine and Feces of Female Mountain Gorillas: A Comparison of EIA and LC-MS Measurements,"['Habumuremyi, S', 'Robbins, MM', 'Fawcett, KA', 'Deschner, T']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22220,FEB 2014,1,"Understanding the reproductive biology of endangered mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) is essential for optimizing conservation strategies, determining any demographic impact of socioecological changes, and providing information for comparative studies of primates. Non-invasive techniques have been used to assess the reproductive function of many primates and the importance of validating the measurements of hormones metabolites is widely recognized because they may vary even within closely related species. To determine if it is possible to non-invasively monitor ovarian activity in wild mountain gorillas, we used enzyme immunoassays (EIA) to quantify both urinary and fecal excretion of immunoreactive pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (iPdG), defined as all metabolites detected by a pregnanediol-3-glucuronide immunoassay (PdG EIA). Simultaneously, we performed the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to quantify the excretion of pregnanediol in urine and feces. Samples were analyzed over nine cycles of five females from the habituated gorillas monitored by Karisoke Research Center, Rwanda. As an additional indicator for ovulation timing, estrone conjugates (E1C) were measured in a subset of urine samples. The concentrations of iPdG and pregnanediol measured in the same samples were significantly correlated. Urinary concentrations of iPdG and pregnanediol fluctuated over the menstrual cycle but did not reveal any cyclic pattern, whereas a typical preovulatory urinary E1C surge and postovulatory increases of fecal iPdG and pregnanediol were detected. The luteal peaks of iPdG and pregnanediol levels in feces were on average 2.8 and 7.6 times higher, respectively, than averaged levels in the corresponding follicular phase. The relative number of days with observed matings was higher within the presumed fertile window than in the preceding period. Overall, the results indicate that fecal analysis of iPdG and pregnanediol is suitable for detecting ovulation in female mountain gorillas. Urinary measurements using both EIA and LC-MS appeared to be uninformative for monitoring ovarian activity in this primate. Am. J. Primatol. 76:180-191, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Younger apes and human children plan their moves in a maze task,"['Volter, CJ', 'Call, J']",COGNITION,10.1016/j.cognition.2013.10.007,FEB 2014,4,"Planning defined as the predetermination of a sequence of actions towards some goal is crucial for complex problem solving. To shed light on the evolution of executive functions, we investigated the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of planning. Therefore, we presented all four great apes species (N = 12) as well as 4- and 5-year-old human preschoolers (N = 24) with a vertical maze task. To gain a reward placed on the uppermost level of the maze, subjects had to move the reward to the bottom through open gaps situated at each level of the maze. In total, there were ten gaps located over three of the maze's levels, and free passage through these gaps could be flexibly blocked using multiple traps. Due to the decision tree design of the maze, the subjects had to plan their actions depending on the trap configuration up to two steps ahead to successfully retrieve the reward. We found that (1) our measure of planning was negatively correlated with age in nonhuman apes, (2) younger apes as well as 5-year-old children planned their moves up to two steps ahead whereas 4-year-olds were limited to plan one step ahead, and (3) similar performance but different underlying limitations between apes and children. Namely, while all species of nonhuman apes were limited by a lack of motor control, human children exhibited a shortage in shifting their attention across a sequence of subgoals.

Improved pan-specific MHC class I peptide-binding predictions using a novel representation of the MHC-binding cleft environment.,"['Carrasco Pro, S', 'Zimic, M', 'Nielsen, M']",Tissue antigens,10.1111/tan.12292,2014-Feb,0,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules play a key role in cell-mediated immune responses presenting bounded peptides for recognition by the immune system cells. Several in silico methods have been developed to predict the binding affinity of a given peptide to a specific MHC molecule. One of the current state-of-the-art methods for MHC class I is NetMHCpan, which has a core ingredient for the representation of the MHC class I molecule using a pseudo-sequence representation of the binding cleft amino acid environment. New and large MHC-peptide-binding data sets are constantly being made available, and also new structures of MHC class I molecules with a bound peptide have been published. In order to test if the NetMHCpan method can be improved by integrating this novel information, we created new pseudo-sequence definitions for the MHC-binding cleft environment from sequence and structural analyses of different MHC data sets including human leukocyte antigen (HLA), non-human primates (chimpanzee, macaque and gorilla) and other animal alleles (cattle, mouse and swine). From these constructs, we showed that by focusing on MHC sequence positions found to be polymorphic across the MHC molecules used to train the method, the NetMHCpan method achieved a significant increase in the predictive performance, in particular, of non-human MHCs. This study hence showed that an improved performance of MHC-binding methods can be achieved not only by the accumulation of more MHC-peptide-binding data but also by a refined definition of the MHC-binding environment including information from non-human species.   2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Peace-Making in Marsupials: The First Study in the Red-Necked Wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus),"['Cordoni, G', 'Norscia, I']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0086859,JAN 29 2014,2,"The issue of reconciliation has been widely investigated in many eutherian mammal species. Nevertheless, no data are available for marsupial mammals. Indeed, the majority of reports focus on group dynamics from an ecological and reproductive perspective, but no study has investigated them from a social point of view. We observed the red-necked wallaby colony (Macropus rufogriseus) hosted at the Tierparc Zoo Berlin (Germany) and collected data on aggressive and post-conflict interactions between group members. We found that the phenomenon of reconciliation is present in the study species (mean group CCT 27.40% +/-8.89% SE). Therefore, we demonstrated, for the first time, the occurrence of reconciliation in a gregarious marsupial mammal. Post-conflict reunion was not affected by the relationship quality between individuals (friendship or kinship) but it was fine-tuned according to the aggression intensity. For example, low intensity conflicts were reconciled whereas high intensity ones were not. Reconciliation reduced anxiety-related scratching in both of the former opponents and limited further attacks towards the victim during the post-conflict period. These findings suggest that the red-necked wallaby, like many eutherian species, can evaluate the costs of reconciliation and engage in peacemaking behavior in the right contexts, in order to maximize its pay-offs."
Ardipithecus ramidus and the evolution of the human cranial base,"['Kimbel, WH', 'Suwa, G', 'Asfaw, B', 'Rak, Y', 'White, TD', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1322639111,JAN 21 2014,3,"The early Pliocene African hominoid Ardipithecus ramidus was diagnosed as a having a unique phylogenetic relationship with the Australopithecus + Homo clade based on nonhoning canine teeth, a foreshortened cranial base, and postcranial characters related to facultative bipedality. However, pedal and pelvic traits indicating substantial arboreality have raised arguments that this taxon may instead be an example of parallel evolution of human-like traits among apes around the time of the chimpanzee-human split. Here we investigated the basicranial morphology of Ar. ramidus for additional clues to its phylogenetic position with reference to African apes, humans, and Australopithecus. Besides a relatively anterior foramen magnum, humans differ from apes in the lateral shift of the carotid foramina, mediolateral abbreviation of the lateral tympanic, and a shortened, trapezoidal basioccipital element. These traits reflect a relative broadening of the central basicranium, a derived condition associated with changes in tympanic shape and the extent of its contact with the petrous. Ar. ramidus shares with Australopithecus each of these human-like modifications. We used the preserved morphology of ARA-VP 1/500 to estimate the missing basicranial length, drawing on consistent proportional relationships in apes and humans. Ar. ramidus is confirmed to have a relatively short basicranium, as in Australopithecus and Homo. Reorganization of the central cranial base is among the earliest morphological markers of the Ardipithecus + Australopithecus + Homo clade."
Does Sympathy Motivate Prosocial Behaviour in Great Apes?,"['Liebal, K', 'Vaish, A', 'Haun, D', 'Tomasello, M']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0084299,JAN 8 2014,8,"Prosocial behaviours such as helping, comforting, or sharing are central to human social life. Because they emerge early in ontogeny, it has been proposed that humans are prosocial by nature and that from early on empathy and sympathy motivate such behaviours. The emerging question is whether humans share these abilities to feel with and for someone with our closest relatives, the great apes. Although several studies demonstrated that great apes help others, little is known about their underlying motivations. This study addresses this issue and investigates whether four species of great apes (Pongo pygmaeus, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus) help a conspecific more after observing the conspecific being harmed (a human experimenter steals the conspecific's food) compared to a condition where no harming occurred. Results showed that in regard to the occurrence of prosocial behaviours, only orangutans, but not the African great apes, help others when help is needed, contrasting prior findings on chimpanzees. However, with the exception of one population of orangutans that helped significantly more after a conspecific was harmed than when no harm occurred, prosocial behaviour in great apes was not motivated by concern for others."
Remembering in tool-use tasks in children and apes: The role of the information at encoding,"['Martin-Ordas, G', 'Atance, CM', 'Call, J']",MEMORY,10.1080/09658211.2013.806553,JAN 2 2014,2,"Providing adults with relevant information (knowledge that they will be tested at some future time) increases motivation to remember. Research has shown that it is more effective to have this information prior to, rather than after, an encoding phase. We investigated this effect in apes and children in the context of tool-use tasks. In Experiment 1 we presented chimpanzees, orangutans, and bonobos with two tool-use tasks and three different two-tool sets. We had two conditions: prospective (PP) and retrospective (RP). In the PP subjects were shown the task that they would have to solve before they were shown the tools with which they could solve it. In the RP this order was reversed. Apes remembered the location of the useful tool better in the PP than in the RP. In Experiment 2 we presented 3- and 4-year-olds with the same conditions. Both age groups remembered the location of the correct tool in the PP, but only the 4-year-olds did so in the RP. Thus providing apes and preschool children with relevant information prior to, rather than after, the encoding phase enhances memory. These results have important implications for the understanding of the evolution of memory in general, and encoding mechanisms in particular."
The Influence of Life History and Sexual Dimorphism on Entheseal Changes in Modern Humans and African Great Apes,"['Milella, M']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0107963,SEP 24 2014,1,"Entheseal changes have been widely studied with regard to their correlation to biomechanical stress and their usefulness for biocultural reconstructions. However, anthropological and medical studies have demonstrated the marked influence of both age and sex on the development of these features. Studies of entheseal changes are mostly aimed in testing functional hypotheses and are mostly focused on modern humans, with few data available for non-human primates. The lack of comparative studies on the effect of age and sex on entheseal changes represent a gap in our understanding of the evolutionary basis of both development and degeneration of the human musculoskeletal system. The aim of the present work is to compare age trajectories and patterns of sexual dimorphism in entheseal changes between modern humans and African great apes. To this end we analyzed 23 postcranial entheses in a human contemporary identified skeletal collection (N = 484) and compared the results with those obtained from the analysis of Pan (N = 50) and Gorilla (N = 47) skeletal specimens. Results highlight taxon-specific age trajectories possibly linked to differences in life history schedules and phyletic relationships. Robusticity trajectories separate Pan and modern humans from Gorilla, whereas enthesopathic patterns are unique in modern humans and possibly linked to their extended potential lifespan. Comparisons between sexes evidence a decreasing dimorphism in robusticity from Gorilla, to modern humans to Pan, which is likely linked to the role played by size, lifespan and physical activity on robusticity development. The present study confirms previous hypotheses on the possible relevance of EC in the study of life history, pointing moreover to their usefulness in evolutionary studies."

Given the importance of the hand in primate evolution, here we examine the evolution of the motor-hand area by comparing the relative size and pattern of cortical folding of the CS surface area from magnetic resonance images in 131 primates, including Old World monkeys, apes and humans. We found that humans and great apes have a well-formed motor-hand area that can be seen in the variation in depth of the CS along the dorsal-ventral plane. We further found that great apes have relatively large CS surface areas compared to Old World monkeys. However, relative to great apes, humans have a small motor-hand area in terms of both adjusted and absolute surface areas. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel"
Acoustic structure and variation in mountain and western gorilla close calls: a syntactic approach,"['Hedwig, D', 'Hammerschmidt, K', 'Mundry, R', 'Robbins, MM', 'Boesch, C']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/1568539X-00003175,2014,6,"Our understanding of the functioning of a species' vocal repertoire can be greatly improved by investigating acoustic variation and using objective classification schemes based on acoustic structure. Here we used a syntactic approach to investigate the acoustic structure of the gorilla close distance vocalizations ('close calls'), which remain as yet little understood. We examined 2130 calls of 10 mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) from Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, and 5 western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from Bai Hokou, Central African Republic. We segmented calls into units using distinct acoustic features and employed model-based cluster analyses to define the repertoire of unit types. We then examined how unit types were combined into calls. Lastly, we compared unit type use between age sex classes and the two study groups. We found that the gorilla close calls consist of 5 intergraded acoustic unit types which were flexibly but yet non-randomly concatenated into 159 combinations. Our results are in line with previous quantitative acoustic analyses demonstrating a high degree of acoustic variation in a variety of animal vocal repertoires, particularly close distance vocalizations. Our findings add on to (1) the recent argument that the common practice of describing vocal repertoires as either discrete or graded may be of little value as such distinctions may be driven by human perception and non-quantitative descriptions of vocal repertoires, and (2) recent studies indicating that flexibility in close range social calls can come about through combinatorial systems, which previously have been studied primarily in long distance vocalizations. Furthermore, our study highlights differences in the vocal repertoire of western and mountain gorillas, as expected given differences in environment and social behaviour. Our results offer opportunities for further in-depth studies investigating the function of the gorilla close calls, which will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of ape vocal communication in general."

Fine-scale genetic structure analyses suggest further male than female dispersal in mountain gorillas,"['Roy, J', 'Gray, M', 'Stoinski, T', 'Robbins, MM', 'Vigilant, L', 'SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION ANALYSIS']",BMC ECOLOGY,10.1186/1472-6785-14-21,JUL 7 2014,1,"Background: Molecular studies in social mammals rarely compare the inferences gained from genetic analyses with field information, especially in the context of dispersal. In this study, we used genetic data to elucidate sex-specific dispersal dynamics in the Virunga Massif mountain gorilla population (Gorilla beringei beringei), a primate species characterized by routine male and female dispersal from stable mixed-sex social groups. Specifically, we conducted spatial genetic structure analyses for each sex and linked our genetically-based observations with some key demographic and behavioural data from this population.

Results: To investigate the spatial genetic structure of mountain gorillas, we analysed the genotypes of 193 mature individuals at 11 microsatellite loci by means of isolation-by-distance and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Although not all males and females disperse, female gorillas displayed an isolation-by-distance pattern among groups and a signal of dispersal at short distances from their natal group based on spatial autocorrelation analyses. In contrast, male genotypes were not correlated with spatial distance, thus suggesting a larger mean dispersal distance for males as compared to females. Both within sex and mixed-sex pairs were on average genetically more related within groups than among groups.

Conclusions: Our study provides evidence for an intersexual difference in dispersal distance in the mountain gorilla. Overall, it stresses the importance of investigating spatial genetic structure patterns on a sex-specific basis to better understand the dispersal dynamics of the species under investigation. It is currently poorly understood why some male and female gorillas disperse while others remain in the natal group. Our results on average relatedness within and across groups confirm that groups often contain close relatives. While inbreeding avoidance may play a role in driving female dispersal, we note that more detailed dyadic genetic analyses are needed to shed light on the role of inbreeding avoidance as an ultimate cause of female dispersal in mountain gorillas."
Niche differentiation and dietary seasonality among sympatric gorillas and chimpanzees in Loango National Park (Gabon) revealed by stable isotope analysis,"['Oelze, VM', 'Head, JS', 'Robbins, MM', 'Richards, M', 'Boesch, C']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.Thevol.2013.10.003,JAN 2014,6,"The feeding ecology of sympatric great ape species yields valuable information for palaeodietary reconstructions in sympatric early hominin species. However, no isotopic references on sympatrically living apes and their feeding ecology are currently available. Here we present the first isotopic study on sympatric great apes, namely western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) from Loango National Park, Gabon. We successfully analyzed the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in a selection of food plants (n = 31) and hair samples (n = 30) retrieved from sleeping nests to test whether niche partitioning among sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas is detectable using isotope analysis of hair. Ape hair strands with roots were sectioned into sequential segments (n = 100) to investigate temporal isotopic variation related to seasonal variations in food resources. We found significant delta C-13 differences between herbaceous plants and fruits, most likely due to canopy effects. While the delta C-13 values of chimpanzees indicate the consumption of fruit, the low delta C-13 values in gorilla hair indicate folivory, most likely the consumption of C-13-depleted herbaceous vegetation. Our isotopic data also confirmed dietary overlap between chimpanzees and gorillas, which varied by season. Gorillas showed significant variation in delta C-13 values in response to season due to shifting proportions of herbaceous plants versus fruits. In chimpanzees, significant seasonal variation in delta N-15 was likely related to the seasonal availability of fruit species with particularly high delta N-15 values. In summary, we found isotopic evidence for niche partitioning and seasonal dietary variation among sympatric great apes at Loango. These findings provide a valuable reference for palaeodietary research on fossil hominins using delta C-13 analyses, Particularly for studies focusing on sympatric taxa and on temporal isotopic variation within incremental tissues such as tooth enamel.

Mountain gorillas face intense ecologic pressures due to their proximity to humans. Human communities outside the national parks, and numerous human activities within the national parks (including research, tourism, illegal hunting, and anti-poaching patrols), lead to a high degree of contact between mountain gorillas and wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. To assess the pathogen transmission potential between wildlife and livestock, feces of mountain gorillas, forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), and domestic cattle (Bos taurus) in Rwanda were examined for the parasites Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Giardia was found in 9% of mountain gorillas, 6% of cattle, and 2% of forest buffalo. Our study represents the first report of Giardia prevalence in forest buffalo. Cryptosporidium-like particles were also observed in all three species. Molecular characterization of Giardia isolates identified zoonotic genotype assemblage B in the gorilla samples and assemblage E in the cattle samples. Significant spatial clustering of Giardia-positive samples was observed in one sector of the park. Although we did not find evidence for transmission of protozoa from forest buffalo to mountain gorillas, the genotypes of Giardia samples isolated from gorillas have been reported in humans, suggesting that the importance of humans in this ecosystem should be more closely evaluated."
Hierarchical Partitioning of Metazoan Protein Conservation Profiles Provides New Functional Insights,"['Witztum, J', 'Persi, E', 'Horn, D', 'Pasmanik-Chor, M', 'Chor, B']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0090282,MAR 4 2014,0,"The availability of many complete, annotated proteomes enables the systematic study of the relationships between protein conservation and functionality. We explore this question based solely on the presence or absence of protein homologues (a.k.a. conservation profiles). We study 18 metazoans, from two distinct points of view: the human's and the fly's. Using the GOrilla gene ontology (GO) analysis tool, we explore functional enrichment of the ""universal proteins'', those with homologues in all 17 other species, and of the ""non-universal proteins''. A large number of GO terms are strongly enriched in both human and fly universal proteins. Most of these functions are known to be essential. A smaller number of GO terms, exhibiting markedly different properties, are enriched in both human and fly non-universal proteins. We further explore the non-universal proteins, whose conservation profiles are consistent with the ""tree of life'' (TOL consistent), as well as the TOL inconsistent proteins. Finally, we applied Quantum Clustering to the conservation profiles of the TOL consistent proteins. Each cluster is strongly associated with one or a small number of specific monophyletic clades in the tree of life. The proteins in many of these clusters exhibit strong functional enrichment associated with the ""life style'' of the related clades. Most previous approaches for studying function and conservation are ""bottom up'', studying protein families one by one, and separately assessing the conservation of each. By way of contrast, our approach is ""top down''. We globally partition the set of all proteins hierarchically, as described above, and then identify protein families enriched within different subdivisions. While supporting previous findings, our approach also provides a tool for discovering novel relations between protein conservation profiles, functionality, and evolutionary history as represented by the tree of life."
Plant selection for nest building by western lowland gorillas in Cameroon,"['Willie, J', 'Tagg, N', 'Petre, CA', 'Pereboom, Z', 'Lens, L']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-013-0363-5,JAN 2014,6,"We examined 834 nests built by western lowland gorillas in Cameroon between July 2008 and July 2011 to identify the plant species used in their construction. Preference for each plant species for nesting was assessed using a 'preference index' calculated by combining information on the occurrence of each species in the forest and in the nests. Forty-six plant species representing about 15 % of the total number of species in the forest and 26 % of species used for nest building were frequently used by gorillas. Preference levels significantly varied among these species. Nests were mostly built with herbs of the families Marantaceae and Zingiberaceae and woody species such as Manniophyton fulvum (liana) and Alchornea floribunda (shrub). As observed in other gorilla populations, suitability for nest building and availability of gorilla food in stems were the likely determinants of plant selection. The total number of species used per nest ranged from 1 to 11, with an average of 4.9. This is high compared to other sites, emphasizing variability in the availability of nest building materials and habitat differences across the range of the western gorilla. Seasonal changes in the use of different habitat types for nesting did not appear to influence plant use for nest building as there was little variation in plant selection across seasons or the composition of nests. Our findings suggest that gorillas non-randomly select plant species to build nests, and use a particular set of species combined at varying proportions, with no clear seasonal or spatial patterns."

In this study, we retrospectively analyzed sera from captive chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans. More than 1000 sera (403 chimpanzee, 77 gorilla, and 535 orang-utan sera) were analyzed for antibodies to the human respiratory viruses RSV (respiratory syncytial virus, hMPV (human metapneumovirus), H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses, and influenza B virus. In all ape species high seroprevalences were found for RSV, hMPV, and influenza B virus. A high percentage of captive chimpanzees also showed evidence of influenza A H1N1 infections, and had low levels of H3N2 antibodies, while in sera from gorillas and orang-utans antibody levels to influenza A and B viruses were much lower or practically absent. Transmission of respiratory viruses was examined in longitudinal sera of young chimpanzees, and in chimpanzee sera taken during health checks. In young animals isolated cases of influenza infections were monitored, but evidence was found for single introductions followed by a rapid dissemination of RSV and hMPV within the group. Implementation of strict guidelines for handling and housing of nonhuman primates was shown to be an efficient method to reduce the introduction of respiratory infections in colonies of captive animals. RSV seroprevalence rates of chimpanzees remained high, probably due to circulating virus in the chimpanzee colony."

However, extremely large and variable group size and growing evidence for affiliative relationships among males, make them a fascinating subject for studies of male-male tolerance and the evolution of large groups. During a 13-month study of free ranging Guianan bearded sakis (Chiropotes sagulatus) in continuous forest in Suriname, we documented variation in group size seasonally and social behaviour, particularly among males. We found that group size was smaller and more variable in the long dry season than the short wet season, perhaps in response to changes in resource availability. We found clear evidence of affiliative male-male relationships, with males being more social than females (89.2% of events involved one male versus 15.6% that involved one female) and typically socializing with other males (68.7% of events involved 2 or more males). We also found no evidence of hierarchical relationships between males (complete absence of agonistic interactions), and we documented unique male-affiliative behaviours and temporary all-male subgroups for the first time. To investigate potential explanations of male tolerance, we compared bearded saki social patterns to other multi-male group living primates (Ateline and Pan spp.). We found similarities with Brachyteles that suggest high intergroup mating competition and scramble competition for mates within groups."

"The social, economic, and environmental contributions of Pan African Sanctuary Alliance primate sanctuaries in Africa","['Ferrie, GM', 'Farmer, KH', 'Kuhar, CW', 'Grand, AP', 'Sherman, J', 'Bettinger, TL']",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,10.1007/s10531-013-0592-3,JAN 2014,2,"Over the last few decades, primate sanctuaries have become more numerous, particularly in Africa. Sanctuaries play an obvious and vital role in the battle against the illegal trade in wildlife and provide opportunities for local people to learn about the importance of protecting habitat and laws governing wildlife trade. Given the multi-disciplinary role of sanctuaries, the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance provides mechanisms to exchange best practices and establishes links to other conservation partners. In April 2011, the managers of the 22 Pan African Sanctuary Alliance members were surveyed in order to collect detailed information on the conservation activities of each sanctuary. The majority of the 22 sanctuaries conducted both on- and off-site education activities, engaging more than 429,000 people in education activities per year. Sanctuaries reported that they provided employment for over 550 local community members across Africa, as well as resources for community education and infrastructure, with an economic impact over $3 million per year. Sanctuaries were also involved in activities that promote law enforcement and believed that the activities they supported have led to better protection of primate habitats. The results of the survey demonstrate that sanctuaries have moved towards supporting and implementing community development activities aimed at poverty reduction, while conducting conservation activities. While Pan African Sanctuary Alliance sanctuaries were initially established to provide care and housing for orphaned, confiscated and displaced primates, this paper demonstrates how sanctuaries have combined ex-situ with in-situ initiatives to support social, economic, and environmental progress in primate range countries in Africa."
Apes' Tracking of Objects and Collections,"['Cacchione, T', 'Hrubesch, C', 'Call, J']",SWISS JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY,10.1024/1421-0185/a000120,2014,0,"Recent research suggests that great apes are less vulnerable to cohesion violations than human infants are. In contrast to human infants, apes successfully track nonsolid substances or split solid objects through occlusion (Cacchione & Call, 2010a; Cacchione, Hrubesch, & Call, 2012, 2013). The present study aims to investigate whether the lower vulnerability of great apes to cohesion violations also manifests when they are tracking collections. While even very young human infants appreciate the continuous existence of solid bound objects, they fail to show similar intuitions when tracking collections of objects (Chiang & Wynn, 2000). In a manual search task inspired by recent infant research, we tested whether humans' closest relatives, the great apes, showed a similar contrast in their reasoning about single solid objects and objects within collections. The results suggest that, in contrast to human infants, great apes appreciate the continuous existence of objects within collections and successfully track them through occlusion. This confirms the view that great apes are generally less vulnerable to cohesion violations than human infants."
RH5-Basigin interaction plays a major role in the host tropism of Plasmodium falciparum,"['Wanaguru, M', 'Liu, WM', 'Hahn, BH', 'Rayner, JC', 'Wright, GJ']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1320771110,DEC 17 2013,25,"Plasmodium falciparum, the cause of almost all human malaria mortality, is a member of the Laverania subgenus which infects African great apes. Interestingly, Laverania parasites exhibit strict host specificity in their natural environment: P. reichenowi, P. billcollinsi, and P. gaboni infect only chimpanzees; P. praefalciparum, P. blacklocki, and P. adleri are restricted to gorillas, and P. falciparum is pandemic in humans. The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for these host restrictions are not understood, although the interaction between the parasite blood-stage invasion ligand EBA175 and the host erythrocyte receptor Glycophorin-A (GYPA) has been implicated previously. We reexamined the role of the EBA175-GYPA interaction in host tropism using recombinant proteins and biophysical assays and found that EBA175 orthologs from the chimpanzee-restricted parasites P. reichenowi and P. billcollinsi both bound to human GYPA with affinities similar to that of P. falciparum, suggesting that the EBA175-GYPA interaction is unlikely to be the sole determinant of Laverania host specificity. We next investigated the contribution of the recently discovered Reticulocyte-binding protein Homolog 5 (RH5)-Basigin (BSG) interaction in host-species selectivity and found that P. falciparum RH5 bound chimpanzee BSG with a significantly lower affinity than human BSG and did not bind gorilla BSG, mirroring the known host tropism of P. falciparum. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified residues in BSG that are responsible for the species specificity of PfRH5 binding. Consistent with the essential role of the PfRH5-BSG interaction in erythrocyte invasion, we conclude that species-specific differences in the BSG receptor provide a molecular explanation for the restriction of P. falciparum to its human host."
Alzheimer's Disease Pathology in the Neocortex and Hippocampus of the Western Lowland Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Perez, SE', 'Raghanti, MA', 'Hof, PR', 'Kramer, L', 'Ikonomovic, MD', 'Lacor, PN', 'Erwin, JM', 'Sherwood, CC', 'Mufson, EJ']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY,10.1002/cne.23428,DEC 15 2013,8,"The two major histopathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid beta protein (A) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). A pathology is a common feature in the aged nonhuman primate brain, whereas NFT are found almost exclusively in humans. Few studies have examined AD-related pathology in great apes, which are the closest phylogenetic relatives of humans. In the present study, we examined A and tau-like lesions in the neocortex and hippocampus of aged male and female western lowland gorillas using immunohistochemistry and histochemistry. Analysis revealed an age-related increase in A-immunoreactive plaques and vasculature in the gorilla brain. A plaques were more abundant in the neocortex and hippocampus of females, whereas A-positive blood vessels were more widespread in male gorillas. Plaques were also A40-, A42-, and A oligomer-immunoreactive, but only weakly thioflavine S- or 6-CN-PiB-positive in both sexes, indicative of the less fibrillar (diffuse) nature of A plaques in gorillas. Although phosphorylated neurofilament immunostaining revealed a few dystrophic neurites and neurons, choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive fibers were not dystrophic. Neurons stained for the tau marker Alz50 were found in the neocortex and hippocampus of gorillas at all ages. Occasional Alz50-, MC1-, and AT8-immunoreactive astrocyte and oligodendrocyte coiled bodies and neuritic clusters were seen in the neocortex and hippocampus of the oldest gorillas. This study demonstrates the spontaneous presence of both A plaques and tau-like lesions in the neocortex and hippocampus in old male and female western lowland gorillas, placing this species at relevance in the context of AD research.

EVALUATING ECHOCARDIOGRAM AND INDIRECT BLOOD PRESSURE RESULTS IN MALE WESTERN LOWLAND GORILLAS (GORILLA GORILLA GORILLA) DURING THREE PHASES OF AN ANESTHETIC PROTOCOL,"['Napier, JE', 'Kutinsky, IB', 'Armstrong, DL', 'Orton, D', 'Hicks, CL', 'Waldoch, J', 'Devlin, WH']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/2012-0186R3.1,DEC 2013,0,"Until the majority of the great ape population is trained for conscious cardiac evaluations, most individuals will require general anesthesia to perform echocardiograms. Within the veterinary community, concern exists that certain anesthetic protocols may exacerbate or artificially induce signs of cardiac disease. Because of potential cardiovascular effects, medetomidine has generally been used cautiously in patients with cardiac disease. The combination of ketamine and medetomidine is frequently used by many institutions because of its reversibility. To date, no published studies have obtained physiologic or echocardiographic parameters comparing different anesthetic protocols. In this study, with the use of seven adult male gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) with and without cardiac disease, echocardiographic and indirect blood pressure data during three phases of an anesthetic protocol were collected. The initial echocardiographic study was completed with ketamine/ medetomidine alone (5- 7 mg/kg, i. m., and 0.05- 0.07 mg/kg, i. m., respectively); the second study was completed after the addition of sevoflurane inhalant anesthesia to this procedure; and the third study was completed after reversal of medetomidine by administration of atipamezole (5: 1 with the medetomidine dose given at induction). Without exception, ejection fractions were 15- 25% lower under anesthesia with medetomidine as compared to ejection fractions after administration of atipamezole. Indirect blood pressures were higher on ketamine/ medetomidine, lower with addition of sevoflurane, and considerably lower after administration of atipamezole."

Laboratory testing included karyotyping, which revealed an unusual mosaicism for Turner syndrome with Triple X (47, X/49, XXX). This appears to be the first report of Turner syndrome in a great ape. In humans, Turner syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 3,000 females, with half of those monosomic for the X chromosome. A small proportion is mosaic for a triple X cell line (3-4%). In humans, Turner syndrome is associated with characteristic phenotype including short stature, obesity, a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, webbing of the neck, and anteverted ears. This individual gorilla is significantly shorter in stature than conspecifics and is obese despite normal caloric intake. Individuals with Turner syndrome should also be screened for common health issues, including congenital heart defects, obesity, kidney abnormalities, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus. Animals with decreased fertility, multiple miscarriages, fetal losses, unusual phenotypes, or a combination of these symptoms should be evaluated for genetic abnormalities."
APPLYING CLINICALLY PROVEN HUMAN TECHNIQUES FOR CONTRACEPTION AND FERTILITY TO ENDANGERED SPECIES AND ZOO ANIMALS: A REVIEW,"['Silber, SJ', 'Barbey, N', 'Lenahan, K', 'Silber, DZ']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/1042-7260-44.4S.S111,DEC 2013,1,"Reversible contraception that does not alter natural behavior is a critical need for managing zoo populations. In addition to reversible contraception, other fertility techniques perfected in humans may be useful, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or oocyte and embryo banking for endangered species like amphibians and Mexican wolves (Canis lupus baileyi). Furthermore, the genetics of human fertility can give a better understanding of fertility in more exotic species. Collaborations were established to apply human fertility techniques to the captive population. Reversible vasectomy might be one solution for reversible contraception that does not alter behavior. Reversible approaches to vasectomy, avoiding secondary epididymal disruption, were attempted in South American bush dogs (Speothos venaticus), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), Przewalski's horse (Equus przewalski poliakov), and Sika deer (Cervus nippon) in a variety of zoos around the world. These techniques were first perfected in > 4,000 humans before attempting them in zoo animals. In vitro fertilization with gestational surrogacy was used to attempt to break the vicious cycle of hand rearing of purebred orangutans, and egg and ovary vitrification in humans have led to successful gamete banking for Mexican wolves and disappearing amphibians. The study of the human Y chromosome has even explained a mechanism of extinction related to global climate change. The best results with vasectomy reversal (normal sperm counts, pregnancy, and live offspring) were obtained when the original vasectomy was performed ""open-ended,"" so as to avoid pressure-induced epididymal disruption. The attempt at gestational surrogacy for orangutans failed because of severe male infertility and the lack of success with human ovarian hyperstimulation protocols. Vitrification of oocytes is already being employed for the Amphibian Ark Project and for Mexican wolves. Vasectomy can be a reversible contraception option in zoo animals, even in endangered species. Ongoing use of gamete and embryo freezing may salvage vanishing species."
Sexual Dimorphism in Relative Sacral Breadth Among Catarrhine Primates,"['Moffett, EA', 'Maddux, SD', 'Ward, CV', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22372,DEC 2013,0,"As the sacrum contributes to the size and shape of the birth canal, the sexually dimorphic sacrum of humans is frequently interpreted within obstetric contexts. However, while the human sacrum has been extensively studied, comparatively little is known about sacral morphology in nonhuman primates. Thus, it remains unclear whether sacral sexual dimorphism exists in other primates, and whether potential dimorphism is primarily related to obstetrics or other factors such as body size dimorphism. In this study, sacra of Homo sapiens, Hylobates lar, Nasalis larvatus, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, Pan troglodytes, and Pan paniscus were evaluated for sexual dimorphism in relative sacral breadth (i.e., the ratio of overall sacral breadth to first sacral vertebral body breadth). Homo sapiens, H. lar, N. larvatus, and G. gorilla exhibit dimorphism in this ratio. Of these, the first three species have large cephalopelvic proportions, whereas G. gorilla has small cephalopelvic proportions. P. pygmaeus, P. troglodytes, and P. paniscus, which all have small cephalopelvic proportions, were not dimorphic for relative sacral breadth. We argue that among species with large cephalopelvic proportions, wide sacral alae in females facilitate birth by increasing the pelvic inlet's transverse diameter. However, given the small cephalopelvic proportions among gorillas, an obstetric basis for dimorphism in relative sacral breadth appears unlikely. This raises the possibility that sacral dimorphism in gorillas is attributable to selection for relatively narrow sacra in males rather than relatively broad sacra in females. Accordingly, these results have implications for interpreting pelvic dimorphism among fossil primates, including hominins. Am J Phys Anthropol 152:435-446, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Assessment of Landscape-Scale Distribution of Sympatric Great Apes in African Rainforests: Concurrent Use of Nest and Camera-Trap Surveys,"['Nakashima, Y', 'Iwata, Y', 'Ando, C', 'Nkoguee, CN', 'Inoue, E', 'Akomo, EFO', 'Nguema, PM', 'Bineni, TD', 'Banak, LN', 'Takenoshita, Y', 'Ngomanda, A', 'Yamagiwa, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22185,DEC 2013,5,"Information on the distribution and abundance of sympatric great apes (Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla) are important for effective conservation and management. Although much research has been done to improve the precision of nest-surveys, trade-offs between data-reliability and research-efficiency have not been solved. In this study, we used different approaches to assess the landscape-scale distribution patterns of great apes. We conducted a conventional nest survey and a camera-trap survey concurrently, and checked the consistency of the estimates. We divided the study area (ca. 500km(2)), containing various types of vegetation and topography, into thirty 16-km(2) grids (4kmx4km) and performed both methods along 2-km transects centered in each grid. We determined the nest creator species according to the definitions by Tutin & Fernandez [Tutin & Fernandez, 1984, Am J Primatol 6:313-336] and estimated nest-site densities of each species by using the conventional distance-sampling approach. We calculated the mean capture rate of 3 camera traps left for 3 months at each grid as the abundance index. Our analyses showed that both methods provided roughly consistent results for the distribution patterns of the species; chimpanzee groups (parties) were more abundant in the montane forest, and gorilla groups were relatively homogeneously distributed across vegetation types. The line-transect survey also showed that the number of nests per nest site did not vary among vegetation types for either species. These spatial patterns seemed to reflect the ecological and sociological features of each species. Although the consistent results may be largely dependent on site-specific conditions (e.g., high density of each species, distinct distribution pattern between the two species), conventional nest-surveys and a subsequent check of their consistency with independent estimates may be a reasonable approach to obtain certain information on the species distribution patterns. Further analytical improvement is necessary for camera-traps to be considered a stand-alone method. Am. J. Primatol. 75:1220-1230, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
New facets of keratin K77: interspecies variations of expression and different intracellular location in embryonic and adult skin of humans and mice,"['Langbein, L', 'Reichelt, J', 'Eckhart, L', 'Praetzel-Wunder, S', 'Kittstein, W', 'Gassler, N', 'Schweizer, J']",CELL AND TISSUE RESEARCH,10.1007/s00441-013-1716-5,DEC 2013,4,"The differential expression of keratins is central to the formation of various epithelia and their appendages. Structurally, the type II keratin K77 is closely related to K1, the prototypical type II keratin of the suprabasal epidermis. Here, we perform a developmental study on K77 expression in human and murine skin. In both species, K77 is expressed in the suprabasal fetal epidermis. While K77 appears after K1 in the human epidermis, the opposite is true for the murine tissue. This species-specific pattern of expression is also found in conventional and organotypic cultures of human and murine keratinocytes. Ultrastructure investigation shows that, in contrast to K77 intermediate filaments of mice, those of the human ortholog are not attached to desmosomes. After birth, K77 disappears without deleterious consequences from human epidermis while it is maintained in the adult mouse epidermis, where its presence has so far gone unnoticed. After targeted Krt1 gene deletion in mice, K77 is normally expressed but fails to functionally replace K1. Besides the epidermis, both human and mouse K77 are present in luminal duct cells of eccrine sweat glands. The demonstration of a K77 ortholog in platypus but not in non-mammalian vertebrates identifies K77 as an evolutionarily ancient component of the mammalian integument that has evolved different patterns of intracellular distribution and adult tissue expression in primates."

Different selective pressures shape the evolution of Toll-like receptors in human and African great ape populations,"['Quach, H', 'Wilson, D', 'Laval, G', 'Patin, E', 'Manry, J', 'Guibert, J', 'Barreiro, LB', 'Nerrienet, E', 'Verschoor, E', 'Gessain, A', 'Przeworski, M', 'Quintana-Murci, L']",HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS,10.1093/hmg/ddt335,DEC 1 2013,12,"The study of the genetic and selective landscape of immunity genes across primates can provide insight into the existing differences in susceptibility to infection observed between human and non-human primates. Here, we explored how selection has driven the evolution of a key family of innate immunity receptors, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), in African great ape species. We sequenced the 10 TLRs in various populations of chimpanzees and gorillas, and analysed these data jointly with a human data set. We found that purifying selection has been more pervasive in great apes than in humans. Furthermore, in chimpanzees and gorillas, purifying selection has targeted TLRs irrespectively of whether they are endosomal or cell surface, in contrast to humans where strong selective constraints are restricted to endosomal TLRs. These observations suggest important differences in the relative importance of TLR-mediated pathogen sensing, such as that of recognition of flagellated bacteria by TLR5, between humans and great apes. Lastly, we used a population genetics-phylogenetics method that jointly analyses polymorphism and divergence data to detect fine-scale variation in selection pressures at specific codons within TLR genes. We identified different codons at different TLRs as being under positive selection in each species, highlighting that functional variation at these genes has conferred a selective advantage in immunity to infection to specific primate species. Overall, this study showed that the degree of selection driving the evolution of TLRs has largely differed between human and non-human primates, increasing our knowledge on their respective biological contribution to host defence in the natural setting."
Ontogenetic changes in limb bone structural proportions in mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei berirtgei),"['Ruff, CB', 'Burgess, ML', 'Bromage, TG', 'Mudakikwa, A', 'McFarlin, SC']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.06.008,DEC 2013,8,"Behavioral studies indicate that adult mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) are the most terrestrial of all nonhuman hominoids, but that infant mountain gorillas are much more arboreal. Here we examine ontogenetic changes in diaphyseal strength and length of the femur, tibia, humerus, radius, and ulna in 30 Virunga mountain gorillas, including 18 immature specimens and 12 adults. Comparisons are also made with 14 adult western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), which are known to be more arboreal than adult mountain gorillas. Infant mountain gorillas have significantly stronger forelimbs relative to hind limbs than older juveniles and adults, but are nonsignificantly different from western lowland gorilla adults. The change in inter-limb strength proportions is abrupt at about two years of age, corresponding to the documented transition to committed terrestrial quadrupedalism in mountain gorillas. The one exception is the ulna, which shows a gradual increase in strength relative to the radius and other long bones during development, possibly corresponding to the gradual adoption of stereotypical fully pronated knuckle-walking in older juvenile gorillas. Inter-limb bone length proportions show a contrasting developmental pattern, with hind limb/forelimb length declining rapidly from birth to five months of age, and then showing no consistent change through adulthood. The very early change in length proportions, prior to significant independent locomotion, may be related to the need for relatively long forelimbs for climbing in a large-bodied hominoid. Virunga mountain gorilla older juveniles and adults have equal or longer forelimb relative to hind limb bones than western lowland adults. These findings indicate that both ontogenetically and among closely related species of Gorilla, long bone strength proportions better reflect actual locomotor behavior than bone length proportions.

"New evidence for diet and niche partitioning in Rudapithecus and Anapithecus from Rudabanya, Hungary","['Deane, AS', 'Nargolwalla, MC', 'Kordos, L', 'Begun, DR']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.08.003,DEC 2013,0,"Rudabanya is rare among Eurasian Miocene fossil primate localities in preserving both a hominid and pliopithecoid, and as such provides the unique opportunity to reconstruct the nature of sympatry and niche partitioning in these taxa. Rudapithecus and Anapithecus have similar locomotor and positional behavior and overlapping body mass ranges. While -prior analyses of molar occlusal anatomy and microwear identify Rudapithecus as a soft-object frugivore, reconstructing the dietary behavior of Anapithecus has been more problematic. This taxon has been interpreted to be more folivorous by some, and more frugivorous by others. Here, we use high-resolution polynomial curve fitting (HR-PCF) to quantify and evaluate the mesiodistal and cervico-incisal curvatures of the incisor crowns of Rudapithecus and Anapithecus to identify diet-specific morphological variation in these taxa. Results are consistent with the interpretation that Anapithecus and Rudapithecus were primarily frugivorous and had diets that included similar resource types. However, Anapithecus may have consumed greater amounts of foliage, similar to extant mixed folivore frugivores (i.e., Gorilla gorilla gorilla, Symphalangus syndactylus), while Rudapithecus generated elevated compressive loads in the incisor region consistent with a specialized role for the anterior dentition in food processing (i.e., removal of tough protective fruit pericarps). We interpret these findings in light of the paleoecology at Rudabanya and conclude that, if these taxa Were indeed sympatric, Anapithecus may have used additional leaf consumption as a seasonal fallback resource to avoid direct competition with Rudapithecus. Conversely, Rudapithecus may have relied on less preferred and harder fruiting resources as a seasonal fallback resource during periods of fruit scarcity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

An outbreak was defined as clinically observable respiratory illness involving at least one third of all the gorillas in a family group (>30% morbidity) over the course of at least 7 days. Outbreaks lasted 2 wk to 4 mo and affected up to five different gorilla family groups, either concurrently or sequentially. An outbreak was considered over if no further clinical illness was observed in the same or another group for at least 1 mo. Clinical signs varied from nasal discharge, sneezing, and mild intermittent coughing (mild), to spasmodic coughing, lethargy, and partial anorexia (moderate), to dyspnea, tachypnea, respiratory distress, weakness, complete anorexia, and occasionally death (severe). Nearly every mountain gorilla group habituated for tourism or research in Rwanda experienced at least one outbreak, and they may be increasing in frequency. In the first 15 yr of the review period 1990-2005, there were nine outbreaks involving 16 gorilla groups; in the last 5 yr of the review period, 2006-2010, there were nine outbreaks involving 11 groups. Although most gorillas recovered without treatment, 41 veterinary procedures were required to medically manage 35 severely ill individuals. Given the rise of mountain gorilla ecotourism in Rwanda, the possibility that respiratory disease results from contact with infected humans is of great concern, and both the etiology and epidemiology of this problem are active areas of research. The observed clinical signs, response to antimicrobial therapy among the sickest individuals, and postmortem findings are most consistent with viral upper respiratory tract infections complicated in some cases by secondary bacterial infections. The current gorilla visitation rules have been designed to minimize the risk of disease transmission between humans and wild human-habituated great apes."
Feeding Ecology of Cross River Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla diehli) at Mawambi Hills: The Influence of Resource Seasonality,"['Etiendem, DN', 'Tagg, N']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-013-9739-z,DEC 2013,2,"Determining the composition of primate diet and identifying factors that affect food choice are important in understanding habitat requirements of primates and designing conservation plans. We studied the diet of Cross River gorillas (Gorilla gorilla diehli) in relation to availability of food resources, in a semideciduous lowland forest site (Mawambi Hills) in Cameroon, from November 2009 to September 2011. Based on 109 d of feeding trail data, 203 fecal samples, and 22 mo of phenological monitoring, we determined that gorillas consumed a total of 242 food items, including 240 plant items from 186 species and 55 taxonomic families. Mawambi gorillas diversified fruit consumption when fruit availability increased, and consumed more fibrous foods (pith, leaf, bark) during times of fruit scarcity, consistent with results of other gorilla studies. However, fruit availability was not related to rainfall, and the period of fruit scarcity was more pronounced at Mawambi than at other gorilla study sites, due to a single long dry season and extreme rainfall at the end of the rainy season that delayed fruit production and ripening. We found no relationship between the daily path length of the gorillas and fruit consumption. We found feeding habits of Mawambi gorillas to be notably similar to those of a population of Cross River gorillas at Afi Mountain, Nigeria, although subtle differences existed, possibly due to site-specific differences in forest composition and altitude. At both sites the liana Landolphia spp. was the single most important food species: the leaves are a staple and the fruits are consumed during periods of fruit scarcity. Snails and maggots were consumed but we observed no further faunivory. We suggest that tree leaves and lianas are important fallback food sources in the gorilla diet in seasonally dry forests."
Gorilla Mothers Also Matter! New Insights on Social Transmission in Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Captivity,"['Luef, EM', 'Pike, S']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0079600,NOV 27 2013,0,"The present paper describes two distinct behaviors relating to food processing and communication that were observed in a community of five separately housed groups of lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in captivity during two study periods one decade apart: (1) a food processing technique to separate wheat from chaff, the so-called PUFF-BLOWING technique; and (2) a male display used to attract the attention of visitors, the so-called THROW-KISS-DISPLAY. We investigated (a) whether the behaviors were transmitted within the respective groups; and if yes, (b) their possible mode of transmission. Our results showed that only the food processing technique spread from three to twenty-one individuals during the ten-year period, whereas the communicative display died out completely. The main transmission mode of the PUFF-BLOWING technique was the mother-offspring dyad: offspring of PUFF-BLOWING mothers showed the behavior, while the offspring of non- PUFF-BLOWING mothers did not. These results strongly support the role mothers play in the acquisition of novel skills and vertical social transmission. Furthermore, they suggest that behaviors, which provide a direct benefit to individuals, have a high chance of social transmission while the loss of benefits can result in the extinction of behaviors."
Analysis of western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) specific Alu repeats,"['McLain, AT', 'Carman, GW', 'Fullerton, ML', 'Beckstrom, TO', 'Gensler, W', 'Meyer, TJ', 'Faulk, C', 'Batzer, MA']",MOBILE DNA,10.1186/1759-8753-4-26,NOV 22 2013,0,"Background: Research into great ape genomes has revealed widely divergent activity levels over time for Alu elements. However, the diversity of this mobile element family in the genome of the western lowland gorilla has previously been uncharacterized. Alu elements are primate-specific short interspersed elements that have been used as phylogenetic and population genetic markers for more than two decades. Alu elements are present at high copy number in the genomes of all primates surveyed thus far. The AluY subfamily and its derivatives have been recognized as the evolutionarily youngest Alu subfamily in the Old World primate lineage.

Results: Here we use a combination of computational and wet-bench laboratory methods to assess and catalog AluY subfamily activity level and composition in the western lowland gorilla genome (gorGor3.1). A total of 1,075 independent AluY insertions were identified and computationally divided into 10 subfamilies, with the largest number of gorilla-specific elements assigned to the canonical AluY subfamily.

Conclusions: The retrotransposition activity level appears to be significantly lower than that seen in the human and chimpanzee lineages, while higher than that seen in orangutan genomes, indicative of differential Alu amplification in the western lowland gorilla lineage as compared to other Homininae."
Possible tool use in a mountain gorilla,"['Grueter, CC', 'Robbins, MM', 'Ndagijimana, F', 'Stoinski, TS']",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,10.1016/j.beproc.2013.09.006,NOV 2013,1,"Here we report a description of putative tool use in wild mountain gorillas. At the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund's Karisoke Research Center in Volcanoes National Park (Rwanda), an adult female was observed using a bamboo culm as a ladder for her offspring. This is one of only a few documented cases of possible tool use in wild gorillas, although tool use behavior is commonly observed in captive gorillas. Although the behavior observed may have been incidental, the present report in combination with previous evidence (Breuer et al., 2005) suggests that tool use in gorillas occurs outside the context of food acquisition and may be directed at overcoming physical obstacles in complex rugged microhabitats such as bamboo forest and swamps.

Human-associated Staphylococcus aureus strains within great ape populations in Central Africa (Gabon),"['Nagel, M', 'Dischinger, J', 'Turck, M', 'Verrier, D', 'Oedenkoven, M', 'Ngoubangoye, B', 'Le Flohic, G', 'Drexler, JF', 'Bierbaum, G', 'Gonzalez, JP']",CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION,10.1111/1469-0691.12119,NOV 2013,2,"The risk of serious infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus is well-known. However, most studies regarding the distribution of (clinically relevant) S.aureus among humans and animals took place in the western hemisphere and only limited data are available from (Central) Africa. In this context, recent studies focused on S.aureus strains in humans and primates, but the question of whether humans and monkeys share related S.aureus strains or may interchange strains remained largely unsolved. In this study we aimed to evaluate the distribution and spread of human-like S.aureus strains among great apes living in captivity. Therefore, a primate facility at the International Centre for Medical Research of Franceville (Gabon) was screened. We detected among the primates a common human S.aureus strain, belonging to the spa-type t148. It was isolated from three different individuals of the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), of which one individual showed a large necrotizing wound. This animal died, most probably of a staphylococcal sepsis. Additionally, we discovered the t148 type among chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) that were settled in the immediate neighbourhood of the infected gorillas. A detailed analysis by pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed that the gorilla and chimpanzee isolates represented two closely related strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a human-associated S.aureus strain causing disease in great apes. The simultaneous detection in gorillas and chimpanzees indicated an interspecies transmission of this S.aureus strain. Our results recommend that protection of wild animals must not only be based on habitat conservation, but also on the assessment of the risk of contact with human pathogens."
RNA-DNA differences in human mitochondria restore ancestral form of 16S ribosomal RNA,"['Bar-Yaacov, D', 'Avital, G', 'Levin, L', 'Richards, AL', 'Hachen, N', 'Jaramillo, BR', 'Nekrutenko, A', 'Zarivach, R', 'Mishmar, D']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.161265.113,NOV 2013,4,"RNA transcripts are generally identical to the underlying DNA sequences. Nevertheless, RNA-DNA differences (RDDs) were found in the nuclear human genome and in plants and animals but not in human mitochondria. Here, by deep sequencing of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and RNA, we identified three RDD sites at mtDNA positions 295 (C-to-U), 13710 (A-to-U, A-to-G), and 2617 (A-to-U, A-to-G). Position 2617, within the 16S rRNA, harbored the most prevalent RDDs (>30% A-to-U and similar to 15% A-to-G of the reads in all tested samples). The 2617 RDDs appeared already at the precursor polycistrone mitochondrial transcript. By using traditional Sanger sequencing, we identified the A-to-U RDD in six different cell lines and representative primates (Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pigmaeus, and Macaca mulatta), suggesting conservation of the mechanism generating such RDD. Phylogenetic analysis of more than 1700 vertebrate mtDNA sequences supported a thymine as the primate ancestral allele at position 2617, suggesting that the 2617 RDD recapitulates the ancestral 16S rRNA. Modeling U or G (the RDDs) at position 2617 stabilized the large ribosomal subunit structure in contrast to destabilization by an A (the pre-RDDs). Hence, these mitochondrial RDDs are likely functional."
Endowment Effects in Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla),"['Drayton, LA', 'Brosnan, SF', 'Carrigan, J', 'Stoinski, TS']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0031902,NOV 2013,2,"Reports of endowment effects in nonhuman primates have received considerable attention in the comparative literature in recent years. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying these effects. Continuing to explore endowment effects across different species of primate may reveal subtle differences in behavior that can help formulate specific hypotheses about the relevant mechanisms and the social and ecological factors that have shaped them. In this study, we use a paradigm that has previously been used to test chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and orangutans (Pongo spp.) to explore whether western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) exhibit comparable endowment effects. We find that gorillas exhibit endowment effects when in possession of food, but not nonfood, items, and that they show a statistically stronger effect than chimpanzees but not orangutans. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that mechanisms for endowment effects in primates may be related to inhibitory control or risk aversion."

A novel test of planning ability: Great apes can plan step-by-step but not in advance of action,"['Tecwyn, EC', 'Thorpe, SKS', 'Chappell, J']",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,10.1016/j.beproc.2013.09.016,NOV 2013,7,"The ability to identify an appropriate sequence of actions or to consider alternative possible action sequences might be particularly useful during problem solving in the physical domain. We developed a new 'paddle-box' task to test the ability of different ape species to plan an appropriate sequence of physical actions (rotating paddles) to retrieve a reward from a goal location. The task had an adjustable difficulty level and was not dependent on species-specific behaviours (e.g. complex tool use). We investigated the planning abilities of captive orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) using the paddle-box. In experiment 1, subjects had to rotate one or two paddles before rotating the paddle with the reward on. Subjects of both species performed poorly, though orangutans rotated more non-food paddles, which may be related to their greater exploratory tendencies and bolder temperament compared with bonobos. In experiment 2 subjects could always rotate the paddle with the reward on first and still succeed, and most subjects of both species performed appropriate sequences of up to three paddle rotations to retrieve the reward. Poor performance in experiment 1 may have been related to subjects' difficulty in inhibiting the prepotent response to act on the reward immediately. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Structured bimanual actions and hand transfers reveal population-level right-handedness in captive gorillas,"['Tabiowo, E', 'Forrester, GS']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.09.010,NOV 2013,2,"There is a common prevailing perception that humans possess a species-unique population-level right-hand bias that has evolutionary links with language. New theories suggest that an early evolutionary division of cognitive function gave rise to a left-hemisphere bias for behaviours underpinned by structured sequences of actions. However, studies of great ape handedness have generated inconsistent results and considerable debate. Additionally, the literature places a heavy focus on chimpanzees, revealing a paucity of handedness findings from other great ape species, and thus limiting the empirical evidence with which we can evaluate evolutionary theory. We observed handedness during spontaneous naturalistic bimanual actions in a captive, biological group of 13 western lowland gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla. Our results demonstrated a significant group-level right-handed bias for bimanual actions as well as for a novel measure of handedness: hand transfer. The two measures revealed similar patterns of handedness, such that a right-hand bias for the majority of individuals was found across both measures. Our findings suggest that human population-level right-handedness is a behavioural trait linked with left-hemisphere dominance for the processing of structured sequences of actions, and was inherited by a common ancestor of both humans and apes.

"Comparative Morphology of the Hominin and African Ape Hyoid Bone, a Possible Marker of the Evolution of Speech","['Steele, J', 'Clegg, M', 'Martelli, S']",HUMAN BIOLOGY,NA,OCT 2013,0,"This study examines the morphology of the hyoid in three closely related species, Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Gorilla gorilla. Differences and similarities between the hyoids of these species are characterized and used to interpret the morphology and affinities of the Dikika A. afarensis, Kebara 2 Neanderthal, and other fossil hominin hyoid bones.

Humans and African apes are found to have distinct hyoid morphologies. In humans the maximum width across the distal tips of the articulated greater horns is usually slightly greater than the maximum length (distal greater horn tip to most anterior point of the hyoid body in the midline). A different pattern is usually found in the African ape hyoids, which have much greater maximum lengths. In humans, the hyoid body is also much more anteroposteriorly shallow in proportion to its height and width, and this is true for all age classes.

The Dikika australopithecine hyoid body proportions are chimpanzee-like. A discriminant function analysis, using a larger subadult sample from the three extant species than that reported by Alemseged et al. (2006), confirms this finding. The Kebara hyoid dimensions (body alone, and articulated body and greater horns) are almost all within the observed range for human hyoids. Discriminant functions clearly distinguish human from African ape hyoids and classify the Kebara 2 hyoid as human (confirming the finding of Arensburg et al. 1989).

Our virtual dissection of a chimpanzee air sac system shows its subhyoid extension into the dorsal hyoid body. Following Alemseged et al. (2006), the expanded bulla characteristic of the African ape and australopithecine hyoid body is therefore interpreted as reflecting the presence of such a laryngeal air sac extension. Its absence in the human, Neanderthal, and H. heidelbergensis (Atapuerca SH) hyoids implicates the loss of the laryngeal air sacs as a derived Neanderthal and modern human trait, which evolved no later than the middle Pleistocene. If, as has been argued by de Boer (2012), the loss of the air sac helped to enhance perceptual discrimination of speech sounds, then this derived hyoid morphology can be added to the list of fossil markers of the capacity for speech."
Variability in the Developmental Life History of the Genus Gorilla,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Perdue, B', 'Breuer, T', 'Hoff, MP']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22301,OCT 2013,5,"Life history is influenced by factors both intrinsic (e.g., body and relative brain size) and extrinsic (e.g., diet, environmental instability) to organisms. In this study, we examine the prediction that energetic risk influences the life history of gorillas. Recent comparisons suggest that the more frugivorous western lowland gorilla shows increased infant dependence, and thus a slower life history, than the primarily folivorous mountain gorilla to buffer against the risk of starvation during periods of food unpredictability. We further tested this hypothesis by incorporating additional life history data from wild western lowland gorillas and captive western lowland gorillas with the assumption that the latter live under ecological conditions of energetic risk that more closely resemble those of mountain gorillas and thus should show faster life histories than wild members of the species. Overall, we found captive western lowland and wild mountain gorillas to have faster developmental life histories than wild western lowland gorillas, weaning their infants approximately a year earlier and thus reducing interbirth intervals by a year. These results provide support that energetic risk plays an important role in determining gorilla life history. Unlike previous assertions, gorillas do not have substantially faster life histories, at least at the genus level, than other great apes. This calls for a re-evaluation of theories concerning comparative ape life history and evolution and highlights the need for data from additional populations that vary in energetic risk.

A Geometric Morphometric Analysis of the Medial Tibial Condyle of African Hominids,"['Sylvester, AD', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.22762,OCT 2013,3,"Although the hominid knee has been heavily scrutinized, shape variation of the medial tibial condyle has yet to be described. Humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas differ in the shape of their medial femoral condyles and in their capacity for external and internal rotation of the tibia relative to the femur. I hypothesize that these differences should be reflected in the shape of the medial tibial condyle of these hominids. Here I use geometric morphometric techniques to uncover shape differences between the medial tibial condyles of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Humans are distinguished from the other two species by having a much more oval-shaped medial tibial condyle, while those of chimpanzees and gorillas are more triangular in outline. Gorillas (especially males) are distinguished by having more concavely-curved condyles (mediolateral direction), which is interpreted as an effect of heavy loading through the medial compartment of the knee in conjunction with differences in the degree of arboreality.

Sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas harbor convergent gut microbial communities,"['Moeller, AH', 'Peeters, M', 'Ndjango, JB', 'Li, YY', 'Hahn, BH', 'Ochman, H']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.154773.113,OCT 2013,16,"The gut microbial communities within great apes have been shown to reflect the phylogenetic history of their hosts, indicating codiversification between great apes and their gut microbiota over evolutionary timescales. But because the great apes examined to date represent geographically isolated populations whose diets derive from different sources, it is unclear whether this pattern of codiversification has resulted from a long history of coadaptation between microbes and hosts (heritable factors) or from the ecological and geographic separation among host species (environmental factors). To evaluate the relative influences of heritable and environmental factors on the evolution of the great ape gut microbiota, we assayed the gut communities of sympatric and allopatric populations of chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas residing throughout equatorial Africa. Comparisons of these populations revealed that the gut communities of different host species can always be distinguished from one another but that the gut communities of sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas have converged in terms of community composition, sharing on average 53% more bacterial phylotypes than the gut communities of allopatric hosts. Host environment, independent of host genetics and evolutionary history, shaped the distribution of bacterial phylotypes across the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, the four most common phyla of gut bacteria. Moreover, the specific patterns of phylotype sharing among hosts suggest that chimpanzees living in sympatry with gorillas have acquired bacteria from gorillas. These results indicate that geographic isolation between host species has promoted the evolutionary differentiation of great ape gut bacterial communities."

It is thought that the old centromere must be inactivated because dicentric chromosomes are not viable. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether 3D arrangement in the interphase nucleus of the novel and old centromeric domains was affected by the repositioning event. The data we present here strongly indicate that the ENC phenomenon does not affect the 3D location of either novel or old centromeres. Very likely, other features, such as gene density, rather than the newly acquired or lost functions, define positioning in the nucleus. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Using antibody E06, which binds the phosphocholine (PC) headgroup of OxPLs, Western and ELISA formats revealed that OxPLs were only present in apo(a) with an intact KIV10 LBS. Lipid extracts of purified human Lp(a) contained both E06- and nonE06-detectable OxPLs by tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Trypsin digestion of 17K r-apo(a) showed PC-containing OxPLs covalently bound to apo(a) fragments by LC-MS/MS that could be saponified by ammonium hydroxide. Interestingly, PC-containing OxPLs were also present in 17K r-apo(a) with Asp(57)-> Ala(57) substitution in KIV10 that lacked E06 immunoreactivity. In conclusion, E06- and nonE06-detectable OxPLs are present in the lipid phase of Lp(a) and covalently bound to apo(a). E06 immunoreactivity, reflecting pro-inflammatory OxPLs accessible to the immune system, is strongly influenced by KIV10 LBS and is unique to human apo(a), which may explain Lp(a)'s pro-atherogenic potential."

In the first part we assessed the current distribution of the behavior on the basis of caretaker reports. In the second (experimental) part, we provided subjects individually with a water basin and two types of food (apples and cereal) that was either clean or covered/mixed with sand. We found that subjects of all species (except gorillas) placed apples in the water before consumption, and that they did so more often when the apples were dirty than when they were clean. Several chimpanzees and orangutans also engaged in behaviors resembling wheat placer mining."
Evolution of life history and behavior in Hominidae: Towards phylogenetic reconstruction of the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor,"['Duda, P', 'Zrzavy, J', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.07.009,OCT 2013,6,"The origin of the fundamental behavioral differences between humans and our closest living relatives is one of the central issues of evolutionary anthropology. The prominent, chimpanzee-based referential model of early hominin behavior has recently been challenged on the basis of broad multispecies comparisons and newly discovered fossil evidence. Here, we argue that while behavioral data on extant great apes are extremely relevant for reconstruction of ancestral behaviors, these behaviors should be reconstructed trait by trait using formal phylogenetic methods. Using the widely accepted hominoid phylogenetic tree, we perform a series of character optimization analyses using 65 selected life-history and behavioral characters for all extant hominid species. This analysis allows us to reconstruct the character states of the last common ancestors of Hominoidea, Hominidae, and the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor. Our analyses demonstrate that many fundamental behavioral and life-history attributes of hominids (including humans) are evidently ancient and likely inherited from the common ancestor of all hominids. However, numerous behaviors present in extant great apes represent their own terminal autapomorphies (both uniquely derived and homoplastic). Any evolutionary model that uses a single extant species to explain behavioral evolution of early hominins is therefore of limited use. In contrast, phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral states is able to provide a detailed suite of behavioral, ecological and life-history characters for each hypothetical ancestor. The living great apes therefore play an important role for the confident identification of the traits found in the chimpanzee human last common ancestor, some of which are likely to represent behaviors of the fossil hominins.

Patterns of Infection with Cryptosporidium sp and Giardia sp in Three Species of Free-Ranging Primates in the Peruvian Amazon,"['West, KA', 'Heymann, EW', 'Mueller, B', 'Gillespie, TR']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-013-9710-z,OCT 2013,0,"Recent evidence of pathogen transmission to humans from wild primates and a greater recognition of the risk of human pathogen transmission to free-ranging primates have raised awareness of the potential impact of zoonotic pathogen transmission on primate conservation and nonhuman primate and human health. Cryptosporidium and Giardia are zoonotic protozoan parasites transmitted via fecal-oral contamination or water that can cause gastritis or enteritis in human and nonhuman primates. From June 2002 to September 2003, we collected fecal samples noninvasively from two species of tamarins (Saguinus mystax and S. nigrifrons) and one species of titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus) at the Estacin Biolgica Quebrada Blanco in the Peruvian Amazon to determine the distribution and prevalence of these potential pathogens. We screened 140 fecal samples representing known individuals of each species for Cryptosporidium and Giardia using the Merifluor immunoflourescence assay to determine the prevalence and intensity of infection with these organisms. With the exception of two samples we collected during the same week from a juvenile male Saguinus mystax, all samples were negative for Cryptosporidium. None of the fecal samples were positive for Giardia. The low prevalence of infection we observed limited our ability to examine the effects of demographic and environmental variables on patterns of infection; however, the exceptionally low prevalence of Cryptosporidium suggests that it is not a current health threat to these primate populations. Although the origin of infection with Cryptosporidium in the juvenile male Saguinus mystax cannot be determined, its presence alerts us to the potential for cross-species transmission and highlights the need for more detailed research to improve our understanding of the distribution and diversity of potentially pathogenic protozoa in Neotropical primate populations."

In tropical Africa, urban demand for bushmeat has been shown to dominate over subsistence hunting and its impact often overrides spatial-ecological species characteristics. To effectively protect remaining mammal populations the main factors that influence their distribution need to be integrated into conservation area prioritisation and management plans. This information has been lacking for Rio Muni, Equatorial Guinea, as prior studies have been outdated or have not systematically covered the continental region of the country. In this study we evaluated: 1) the relative importance of local vs. commercial hunting; 2) wildlife density of protected vs. non-protected areas; and 3) the importance of ecological factors vs. human influence in driving mammal density distribution in Rio Muni. We adopted a systematic countrywide line transect approach with particular focus on apes and elephants, but also including other mammal species. For analysis of field data we used generalised linear models with a set of predictor variables representing ecological conditions, anthropogenic pressure and protected areas. We estimate that there are currently 884 (437-1,789) elephants and 11,097 (8,719-13,592) chimpanzees and gorillas remaining in Rio Muni. The results indicate strong hunting pressures on both local and commercial levels, with roads demonstrating a negative impact on elephants and overall mammal body mass. Protected areas played no role in determining any of the mammal species distributions and significant human hunting signs were found inside these protected areas, illustrating the lack of environmental law enforcement throughout the country. Rio Muni is currently under-represented in conservation efforts in Western Equatorial Africa, and we recommend a focus on cross-boundary conservation, in particular in the Monte Alen-Monts de Cristal and Rio Campo Ma'an conservation landscapes, where the highest densities and diversity of large mammals remain."
Close association between paralogous multiple isomiRs and paralogous/orthologues miRNA sequences implicates dominant sequence selection across various animal species,"['Guo, L', 'Zhao, Y', 'Zhang, H', 'Yang, S', 'Chen, F']",GENE,10.1016/j.gene.2013.06.083,SEP 25 2013,9,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial negative regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Next-generation sequencing technologies have identified a series of miRNA variants (named isomiRs). In this study, paralogous isomiR assemblies (from the miRNA locus) were systematically analyzed based on data acquired from deep sequencing data sets. Evolutionary analysis of paralogous (members in miRNA gene family in a specific species) and orthologues (across different animal species) miRNAs was also performed. The sequence diversity of paralogous isomiRs was found to be similar to the diversity of paralogous and orthologues miRNAs. Additionally, both isomiRs and paralogous/orthologues miRNAs were implicated in 5' and 3' ends (especially 3' ends), nucleotide substitutions, and insertions and deletions. Generally, multiple isomiRs can be produced from a single miRNA locus, but most of them had lower enrichment levels, and only several dominant isomiR sequences were detected. These dominant isomiR groups were always stable, and one of them would be selected as the most abundant miRNA sequence in specific animal species. Some isomiRs might be consistent to miRNA sequences in some species but not the other. Homologous miRNAs were often detected in similar isomiR repertoires, and showed similar expression patterns, while dominant isomiRs showed complex evolutionary patterns from miRNA sequences across the animal kingdom. These results indicate that the phenomenon of multiple isomiRs is not a random event, but rather the result of evolutionary pressures. The existence of multiple isomiRs enables different species to express advantageous sequences in different environments.

Matching based on biological categories in Orangutans (Pongo abelii) and a Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Vonk, J']",PEERJ,10.7717/peerj.158,SEP 10 2013,3,"Following a series of experiments in which six orangutans and one gorilla discriminated photographs of different animal species in a two-choice touch screen procedure, Vonk & MacDonald (2002) and Vonk & MacDonald (2004) concluded that orangutans, but not the gorilla, seemed to learn intermediate level category discriminations, such as primates versus non-primates, more rapidly than they learned concrete level discriminations, such as orangutans versus humans. In the current experiments, four of the same orangutans and the gorilla were presented with delayed matching-to-sample tasks in which they were rewarded for matching photos of different members of the same primate species; golden lion tamarins, Japanese macaques, and proboscis monkeys, or family; gibbons, lemurs (Experiment 1), and subsequently for matching photos of different species within the following classes: birds, reptiles, insects, mammals, and fish (Experiment 2). Members of both Great Ape species were rapidly able to match the photos at levels above chance. Orangutans matched images from both category levels spontaneously whereas the gorilla showed effects of learning to match intermediate level categories. The results show that biological knowledge is not necessary to form natural categories at both concrete and intermediate levels."
Manual Pressure Distribution Patterns of Knuckle-Walking Apes,"['Matarazzo, S']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22325,SEP 2013,1,"Differences in how the hands of gorillas and chimpanzees contact the ground while knuckle walking have been noted but generally not quantified. It is widely believed that gorillas maintain a pronated arm and contact the ground with digits 2-5 consistently, while chimpanzees have variable arm position and digit contact. To further test these generalizations, distribution of pressure across the manus, peak digital pressures, and hand position were quantified using a pressure mat in eight captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and seven gorillas (Gorilla gorilla). Chimpanzees and gorillas make initial ground contact with the ulnar aspect of the hand and pressure moves radially. They differ in which digit usually makes final contact and receives maximum pressure, and hand position during contact. Gorillas regularly use a palm-back hand position and touch-off with digit 2. They show less variation in pressure application across the digits. Chimpanzees are more variable in hand position and pressure application. In both, hand position plays a key role in determining which digit acts as the final touch-off element. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Monkeys perform as well as apes and humans in a size discrimination task,"['Schmitt, V', 'Kroger, I', 'Zinner, D', 'Call, J', 'Fischer, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-013-0616-0,SEP 2013,1,"Whether the cognitive competences of monkeys and apes are rather similar or whether the larger-brained apes outperform monkeys in cognitive experiments is a highly debated topic. Direct comparative analyses are therefore essential to examine similarities and differences among species. We here compared six primate species, including humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas (great apes), olive baboons, and long-tailed macaques (Old World monkeys) in a task on fine-grained size discrimination. Except for gorillas, subjects of all taxa (i.e. humans, apes, and monkeys) were able to discriminate three-dimensional cubes with a volume difference of only 10 % (i.e. cubes of 50 and 48 mm side length) and performed only slightly worse when the cubes were presented successively. The minimal size discriminated declined further with increasing time delay between presentations of the cubes, highlighting the difficulty to memorize exact size differences. The results suggest that differences in brain size, as a proxy for general cognitive abilities, did not account for variation in performance, but that differential socio-ecological pressures may better explain species differences. Our study highlights the fact that differences in cognitive abilities do not always map neatly onto phylogenetic relationships and that in a number of cognitive experiments monkeys do not fare significantly worse than apes, casting doubt on the assumption that larger brains per se confer an advantage in such kinds of tests."
The origin and molecular epidemiology of HIV,"['Peeters, M', 'Jung, M', 'Ayouba, A']",EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTI-INFECTIVE THERAPY,10.1586/14787210.2013.825443,SEP 2013,2,"HIV-1 in humans resulted from at least four cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) from chimpanzees and gorillas in West Central Africa, while HIV-2 viruses resulted from at least eight independent transmissions of SIVs infecting sooty mangabeys in West Africa only, where one of these transmissions (HIV-1 group M) is responsible for the global epidemic. HIV-1 M is subdivided into nine subtypes and a wide diversity of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms. The heterogenic HIV-1 M subtype/CRF distribution is the result of founder effects. The genetic diversity of HIV-1 continues to increase overtime due to demographic factors such as travel and migration and frequent co/superinfections. In addition, the expanded access to antiretrovirals leads to an increasing number of drug-resistant strains, especially in resource limited countries."
Effective sociodemographic population assessment of elusive species in ecology and conservation management,"['Head, JS', 'Boesch, C', 'Robbins, MM', 'Rabanal, LI', 'Makaga, L', 'Kuhl, HS']",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1002/ece3.670,SEP 2013,7,"Wildlife managers are urgently searching for improved sociodemographic population assessment methods to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented conservation activities. These need to be inexpensive, appropriate for a wide spectrum of species and straightforward to apply by local staff members with minimal training. Furthermore, conservation management would benefit from single approaches which cover many aspects of population assessment beyond only density estimates, to include for instance social and demographic structure, movement patterns, or species interactions. Remote camera traps have traditionally been used to measure species richness. Currently, there is a rapid move toward using remote camera trapping in density estimation, community ecology, and conservation management. Here, we demonstrate such comprehensive population assessment by linking remote video trapping, spatially explicit capture- recapture (SECR) techniques, and other methods. We apply it to three species: chimpanzees Pan troglodytes troglodytes, gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla, and forest elephants Loxodonta cyclotis in Loango National Park, Gabon. All three species exhibited considerable heterogeneity in capture probability at the sex or group level and density was estimated at 1.72, 1.2, and 1.37 individuals per km 2 and male to female sex ratios were 1:2.1, 1:3.2, and 1:2 for chimpanzees, gorillas, and elephants, respectively. Association patterns revealed four, eight, and 18 independent social groups of chimpanzees, gorillas, and elephants, respectively: key information for both conservation management and studies on the species' ecology. Additionally, there was evidence of resident and nonresident elephants within the study area and intersexual variation in home range size among elephants but not chimpanzees. Our study highlights the potential of combining camera trapping and SECR methods in conducting detailed population assessments that go far beyond documenting species diversity patterns or estimating single species population size. Our study design is widely applicable to other species and spatial scales, and moderately trained staff members can collect and process the required data. Furthermore, assessments using the same method can be extended to include several other ecological, behavioral, and demographic aspects: fission and fusion dynamics and intergroup transfers, birth and mortality rates, species interactions, and ranging patterns."
Adenoviruses isolated from wild gorillas are closely related to human species C viruses.,"['Duncan, McVey', 'Cranfield, Michael R', 'Torano, Holly', 'Kuete, Hubert M', 'Lee, Grace P', 'Glenn, Andrew', 'Bruder, Joseph T', 'Rangel, David', 'Brough, Douglas E', 'Gall, Jason G']",Virology,10.1016/j.virol.2013.05.041,2013-Sep (Epub 2013 Jun 24),2,"We have isolated and cultured three distinct adenoviruses from wild gorillas.

The three wild gorilla adenoviruses clustered with the other species C captive gorilla adenoviruses, forming a branch separate from human and chimpanzee/bonobo adenoviruses. Animal sera to the three newly isolated viruses did not cross-neutralize, demonstrating serological distinctiveness.

Alternative biological assumptions strongly influence models of climate change effects on mountain gorillas,"['Thorne, JH', 'Seo, C', 'Basabose, A', 'Gray, M', 'Belfiore, NM', 'Hijmans, RJ']",ECOSPHERE,10.1890/ES13-00123.1,SEP 2013,2,"Endangered species conservation planning needs to consider the effects of future climate change. Species distribution models are commonly used to predict future shifts in habitat suitability. We evaluated the effects of climate change on the highly endangered mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) using a variety of modeling approaches, and assessing model outputs from the perspective of three spatial habitat management strategies: status quo, expansion and relocation. We show that alternative assumptions about the ecological niche of mountain gorillas can have a very large effect on model predictions. ` Standard' correlative models using 18 climatic predictor variables suggested that by 2090 there would be no suitable habitat left for the mountain gorilla in its existing parks, whereas a `limiting-factor' model, that uses a proxy of primary productivity, suggested that climate suitability would not change much. Species distribution models based on fewer predictor variables, on alternative assumptions about niche conservatism (including or excluding the other subspecies Gorilla beringii graueri), and a model based on gorilla behavior, had intermediate predictions. These alternative models show strong variation, and, in contrast to the standard approach with 18 variables, suggest that mountain gorilla habitat in the parks may remain suitable, that protected areas could be expanded into lower (warmer) areas, and that there might be climactically suitable habitat in other places where new populations could possibly be established. Differences among model predictions point to avenues for model improvement and further research. Similarities among model predictions point to possible areas for climate change adaptation management. For species with narrow distributions, such as the mountain gorilla, modeling the impact of climate change should be based on careful evaluation of their biology, particularly of the factors that currently appear to limit their distribution, and should avoid the naive application of standard correlative methods with many predictor variables."
Pigeons learn virtual patterned-string problems in a computerized touch screen environment,"['Wasserman, EA', 'Nagasaka, Y', 'Castro, L', 'Brzykcy, SJ']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-013-0608-0,SEP 2013,5,"For many decades, developmental and comparative psychologists have used a variety of string tasks to assess the perceptual and cognitive capabilities of human children of different ages and different species of nonhuman animals. The most important and widely used of these problems are patterned-string tasks, in which the organism is shown two or more strings, only one of which is connected to a reward. The organism must determine which string is attached to the reward and pull it. We report a new way to implement patterned-string tasks via a computerized touch screen apparatus. Pigeons successfully learned such virtual patterned-string tasks and exhibited the same general performance profile as animals given conventional patterned-string tasks. In addition, variations in the length, separation, and alignment of the strings reliably affected the pigeons' virtual string-pulling behavior. These results not only testify to the power and versatility of our computerized string task, but they also demonstrate that pigeons can concurrently contend with a broad range of demanding patterned-string problems, thereby eliminating many alternative interpretations of their behavior. The virtual patterned-string task may thus permit expanded exploration of other species and variables which would be unlikely to be undertaken either because of inadequacies of conventional methodology or sensorimotor limitations of the studied organisms."
Natural category discrimination in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at three levels of abstraction,"['Vonk, J', 'Jett, S', 'Mosteller, K', 'Galvan, M']",LEARNING & BEHAVIOR,10.3758/s13420-013-0103-0,SEP 2013,2,"Two adult chimpanzees were presented with a series of natural category discrimination tasks on a touch screen computer, in which the discriminations varied in degree of abstraction. At the concrete level, discriminations could be made on the basis of single perceptual features, but at the more abstract level, categories were more inclusive, containing exemplars with variant perceptual features. For instance, at the most abstract level, the chimpanzees were required to select images of animals rather than nonanimals, and exemplars within both categories were perceptually diverse. One chimpanzee showed positive transfer at each level of abstraction but required more sessions to reach criterion as the discriminations became more abstract. The other chimpanzee failed to demonstrate consistent significant acquisition of a concept. The results indicate that unlike other apes and black bears, tested previously, chimpanzees found the most abstract discriminations the most difficult to acquire. Analyses of the features of pictures that yielded high or low accuracy revealed no significant differences on several key features, suggesting that the presence of facial features, eyes, or specific coloration did not control responding. In addition, the chimpanzees performed more accurately with photos judged as less typical exemplars of the category by human raters. However, responses to pictures of particular species suggest that chimpanzees may rely on perceptual similarity to familiar exemplars when acquiring experimenter-defined natural categories."
Considering the role of social dynamics and positional behavior in gestural communication research,"['Smith, LW', 'Delgado, RA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22151,SEP 2013,2,"While the hominin fossil record cannot inform us on either the presence or extent of social and cognitive abilities that may have paved the way for the emergence of language, studying non-vocal communication among our closest living relatives, the African apes, may provide valuable information about how language originated. Although much has been learned from gestural signaling in non-human primates, we have not yet established how and why gestural repertoires vary across species, what factors influence this variation, and how knowledge of these differences can contribute to an understanding of gestural signaling's contribution to language evolution. In this paper, we review arguments surrounding the theory that language evolved from gestural signaling and suggest some important factors to consider when conducting comparative studies of gestural communication among African apes. Specifically, we propose that social dynamics and positional behavior are critical components that shape the frequency and nature of gestural signaling across species and we argue that an understanding of these factors could shed light on how gestural communication may have been the basis of human language. We outline predictions for the influence of these factors on the frequencies and types of gestures used across the African apes and highlight the importance of including these factors in future gestural communication research with primates.

Sex differences in tool use acquisition in bonobos (Pan paniscus),"['Boose, KJ', 'White, FJ', 'Meinelt, A']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22155,SEP 2013,6,"All the great ape species are known tool users in both the wild and captivity, although there is great variation in ability and behavioral repertoire. Differences in tool use acquisition between chimpanzees and gorillas have been attributed to differing levels of social tolerance as a result of differences in social structure. Chimpanzees also show sex differences in acquisition and both chimpanzees and bonobos demonstrate a female bias in tool use behaviors. Studies of acquisition are limited in the wild and between species comparisons are complicated in captivity by contexts that often do not reflect natural conditions. Here we investigated tool use acquisition in a captive group of naive bonobos by simulating naturalistic conditions. We constructed an artificial termite mound fashioned after those that occur in the wild and tested individuals within a social group context. We found sex differences in latencies to attempt and to succeed where females attempted to fish, were successful more quickly, and fished more frequently than males. We compared our results to those reported for chimpanzees and gorillas. Males across all three species did not differ in latency to attempt or to succeed. In contrast, bonobo and chimpanzee females succeeded more quickly than did female gorillas. Female bonobos and female chimpanzees did not differ in either latency to attempt or to succeed. We tested the social tolerance hypothesis by investigating the relationship between tool behaviors and number of neighbors present. We also compared these results to those reported for chimpanzees and gorillas and found that bonobos had the fewest numbers of neighbors present. The results of this study do not support the association between number of neighbors and tool behavior reported for chimpanzees. However, bonobos demonstrated a similar sex difference in tool use acquisition, supporting the hypothesis of a female bias in tool use in Pan. Am. J. Primatol. 75:917-926, 2013.

"Population Status of Pan troglodytes verus in Lagoas de Cufada Natural Park, Guinea-Bissau","['Carvalho, JS', 'Marques, TA', 'Vicente, L']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0071527,AUG 7 2013,4,"The western chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes verus, has been classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1988. Intensive agriculture, commercial plantations, logging, and mining have eliminated or degraded the habitats suitable for P. t. verus over a large part of its range. In this study we assessed the effect of land-use change on the population size and density of chimpanzees at Lagoas de Cufada Natural Park (LCNP), Guinea-Bissau. We further explored chimpanzee distribution in relation to landscape-level proxies of human disturbance. Nest count and distance-sampling methods were employed along 11 systematically placed linear transects in 2010 and 2011. Estimated nest decay rate was 293.9 days (%CV = 58.8). Based on this estimate of decay time and using the Standing-Crop Nest Count Method, we obtained a habitat-weighted average chimpanzee density estimate for 2011 of 0.22 nest building chimpanzees/km(2) (95% CI 0.08-0.62), corresponding to 137 (95% CI 51.0-390.0) chimpanzees for LCNP. Human disturbance had a negative influence on chimpanzee distribution as nests were built farther away from human settlements, roads, and rivers than if they were randomly distributed, coinciding with the distribution of the remaining patches of dense canopy forest. We conclude that the continuous disappearance of suitable habitat (e. g. the replacement of LCNP's dense forests by monocultures of cashew plantations) may be compromising the future of one of the most threatened Guinean coastal chimpanzee populations. We discuss strategies to ensure long-term conservation in this important refuge for this chimpanzee subspecies at its westernmost margin of geographic distribution."
"Long-Term Monitoring of Microsporidia, Cryptosporidium and Giardia Infections in Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Different Stages of Habituation in Dzanga Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic","['Sak, B', 'Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Kvetonova, D', 'Mynarova, A', 'Shutt, KA', 'Pomajbikova, K', 'Kalousova, B', 'Modry, D', 'Benavides, J', 'Todd, A', 'Kvac, M']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0071840,AUG 7 2013,12,"Background: Infectious diseases pose one of the greatest threats to endangered species, and a risk of gastrointestinal parasite transmission from humans to wildlife has always been considered as a major concern of tourism. Increased anthropogenic impact on primate populations may result in general changes in communities of their parasites, and also in a direct exchange of parasites between humans and primates.

Aims: To evaluate the impact of close contact with humans on the occurrence of potentially zoonotic protists in great apes, we conducted a long-term monitoring of microsporidia, Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections in western lowland gorillas at different stages of the habituation process, humans, and other wildlife in Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas in the Central African Republic.

Results: We detected Encephalitozoon cuniculi genotypes I and II (7.5%), Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotype D and three novel genotypes (gorilla 1-3) (4.0%), Giardia intestinalis subgroup A II (2.0%) and Cryptosporidium bovis (0.5%) in gorillas, whereas in humans we found only G. intestinalis subgroup A II (2.1%). In other wild and domestic animals we recorded E. cuniculi genotypes I and II (2.1%), G. intestinalis assemblage E (0.5%) and C. muris TS03 (0.5%).

Conclusion: Due to the non-specificity of E. cuniculi genotypes we conclude that detection of the exact source of E. cuniculi infection is problematic. As Giardia intestinalis was recorded primarily in gorilla groups with closer human contact, we suggest that human-gorilla transmission has occurred. We call attention to a potentially negative impact of habituation on selected pathogens which might occur as a result of the more frequent presence of humans in the vicinity of both gorillas under habituation and habituated gorillas, rather than as a consequence of the close contact with humans, which might be a more traditional assumption. We encourage to observe the sections concerning hygiene from the IUCN best practice guidelines for all sites where increased human-gorilla contact occurs."
Memory for Distant Past Events in Chimpanzees and Orangutans,"['Martin-Ordas, G', 'Berntsen, D', 'Call, J', 'INVOLUNTARY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORIES']",CURRENT BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cub.2013.06.017,AUG 5 2013,12,"Determining the memory systems that support nonhuman animals' capacity to remember distant past events is currently the focus an intense research effort and a lively debate [1-3]. Comparative psychology has largely adopted Tulving's framework by focusing on whether animals remember what-where-when something happened (i.e., episodic-like memory) [4-6]. However, apes have also been reported to recall other episodic components [7] after single-trial exposures [8, 9]. Using a new experimental paradigm we show that chimpanzees and orangutans recalled a tool-finding event that happened four times 3 years earlier (experiment 1) and a tool-finding unique event that happened once 2 weeks earlier (experiment 2). Subjects were able to distinguish these events from other tool-finding events, which indicates binding of relevant temporal-spatial components. Like in human involuntary autobiographical memory, a cued, associative retrieval process triggered apes' memories: when presented with a particular setup, subjects instantaneously remembered not only where to search for the tools (experiment 1), but also the location of the tool seen only once (experiment 2). The complex nature of the events retrieved, the unexpected and fast retrieval, the long retention intervals involved, and the detection of binding strongly suggest that chimpanzees and orangutans' memories for past events mirror some of the features of human autobiographical memory."

To determine whether most silverbacks stay close to their relatives, we analyzed autosomal and Y-chromosomal microsatellites (STRs) in wild WLGs at Moukalaba, Gabon. We obtained STR genotypes for 38 individuals, including eight silverbacks and 12 adult females in an approximately 40 km(2) area. Among them, 20 individuals were members of one identified group (Group Gentil; GG), including one silverback and six adult females. The silverback sired all 13 of the offspring in GG and no Y-STR polymorphism within GG was found, as expected in a one-male group structure. Over all silverbacks sampled, Y-STR diversity was high considering the limited sampling area, and silverbacks with similar Y-STR haplotypes were not always located in nearby areas. Although the misclassification rate of kinship estimates in this study was not negligible, there were no kin dyads among all silverbacks sampled. These results suggest that silverbacks born in the same group do not stay close to each other after maturation. The Y-STR diversity in this study was similar to that of a previous study conducted in an area that was approximately 150 times larger than our study area. Similarity of WLG Y-STR diversity between studies at different sampling scales suggests that male gene flow may not be geographically limited. These results suggest that WLG males normally disperse from their natal areas after maturation, at least, in Moukalaba. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
"Postnatal temporal bone ontogeny in Pan, Gorilla, and Homo, and the implications for temporal bone ontogeny in Australopithecus afarensis","['Terhune, CE', 'Kimbel, WH', 'Lockwood, CA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22318,AUG 2013,3,"Assessments of temporal bone morphology have played an important role in taxonomic and phylogenetic evaluations of fossil taxa, and recent three-dimensional analyses of this region have supported the utility of the temporal bone for testing taxonomic and phylogenetic hypotheses. But while clinical analyses have examined aspects of temporal bone ontogeny in humans, the ontogeny of the temporal bone in non-human taxa is less well documented. This study examines ontogenetic allometry of the temporal bone in order to address several research questions related to the pattern and trajectory of temporal bone shape change during ontogeny in the African apes and humans. We further apply these data to a preliminary analysis of temporal bone ontogeny in Australopithecus afarensis. Three-dimensional landmarks were digitized on an ontogenetic series of specimens of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla. Data were analyzed using geometric morphometric methods, and shape changes throughout ontogeny in relation to size were compared. Results of these analyses indicate that, despite broadly similar patterns, African apes and humans show marked differences in development of the mandibular fossa and tympanic portions of the temporal bone. These findings indicate divergent, rather than parallel, postnatal ontogenetic allometric trajectories for temporal bone shape in these taxa. The pattern of temporal bone shape change with size exhibited by A. afarensis showed some affinities to that of humans, but was most similar to extant African apes, particularly Gorilla.

How Effective Are Geometric Morphometric Techniques for Assessing Functional Shape Variation? An Example From the Great Ape Temporomandibular Joint,"['Terhune, CE']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.22724,AUG 2013,3,"Functional shape analyses have long relied on the use of shape ratios to test biomechanical hypotheses. This method is powerful because of the ease with which results are interpreted, but these techniques fall short in quantifying complex morphologies that may not have a strong biomechanical foundation but may still be functionally informative. In contrast, geometric morphometric methods are continually being adopted for quantifying complex shapes, but they tend to prove inadequate in functional analyses because they have little foundation in an explicit biomechanical framework. The goal of this study was to evaluate the intersection of these two methods using the great ape temporomandibular joint as a case study. Three-dimensional coordinates of glenoid fossa and mandibular condyle shape were collected using a Microscribe digitizer. Linear distances extracted from these landmarks were analyzed using a series of one-way ANOVAs; further, the landmark configurations were analyzed using geometric morphometric techniques. Results suggest that the two methods are broadly similar, although the geometric morphometric data allow for the identification of shape differences among taxa that were not immediately apparent in the univariate analyses. Furthermore, this study suggests several new approaches for translating these shape data into a biomechanical context by adjusting the data using a biomechanically relevant variable.

Behavioral correlates and welfare implications of informal interactions between caretakers and zoo-housed chimpanzees and gorillas,"['Chelluri, GI', 'Ross, SR', 'Wagner, KE']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2012.06.008,AUG 2013,5,"In captive animal facilities, human staff members are a relevant part of the animals' social environment in addition to providing care and managing the social group. Structured, predictable interactions and relaxed, spontaneous contacts may all affect the animals' behavior and well-being, both immediately and in the long term. This study examined the association between unstructured, affiliative caretaker-animal interactions and the behavior of zoo-housed chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). The interactions in question included play, spontaneous feeding, and other positive vocal and visual interactions performed through a protective mesh barrier. Behavioral data collected over 48 months were used to identify correlates of caretaker interactions among key behaviors relevant to welfare assessment, including agonism, sexual behavior, abnormal behavior, prosocial behavior, and self-directed behavior, as well as the presence of wounds. In observational sessions containing one or more caretaker interactions, chimpanzees and gorillas both showed higher agonism (P = 0.044 and P = 0.042, respectively) and lower self-directed behavior (P = 0.035 for chimpanzees and P = 0.001 for gorillas) than in control samples. Agonism rose in chimpanzees from an average of 0.01-0.12% of overall behaviors, and in gorillas from 0% to 0.1%, while self-directed behavior decreased in chimpanzees from an average of 9:54-7.81% and in gorillas from 11.02% to 7.38%. Chimpanzees also showed lower intraspecific prosocial behavior in samples with caretaker interactions (P = 0.044), decreasing from an average of 11.5% to 5.52% of overall behaviors. Finally, gorillas exhibited less abnormal behavior in caretaker interaction samples than in control samples (P = 0.029), decreasing from a mean of 2.42-1.77% of overall behaviors. In chimpanzees, higher agonism and lower prosocial behavior are indicative of greater arousal, although we would expect self-directed behavior to rise rather than decrease in that situation. The results in gorillas are mixed with respect to welfare outcomes: higher agonism is indicative of arousal, but lower abnormal and self-directed behaviors suggest a decrease in stress and anxiety. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the influence of all forms of interaction with heterospecifics and demonstrate a need for welfare assessments that include even positively intended interactions.

Effects of age and group type on social behaviour of male western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in North American zoos,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Lukas, KE', 'Kuhar, CW']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2013.07.003,AUG 2013,2,"The long-term management of male gorillas in zoos is a significant challenge. The demographics of the population - specifically a 50/50 sex ratio and the desire to form breeding groups that contain a single male and multiple females - necessitates housing a majority of adult males outside of mixed-sex groups. The primary approach for socially housing these individuals within the North American population has been the formation of all-male groups. Our previous research had found that captive all-male groups were cohesive and showed behavioural patterns similar to what had been observed in the wild. To gain a more complete understanding of male social dynamics as a function of group type, we examined social interactions among male gorillas living in either bachelor or mixed-sex groups. Subjects included 48 individuals ranging in age from 6 to 94 years. Overall, we found age to be the primary predictor of social behaviour. Rates of affiliative behaviour were highest in immaturity with a gradual shift to more dominance related behaviours (displacements, non-contact aggression) in young adulthood. Non-contact aggression increased as a function of number of adult males in the group, which likely accounts for higher rates of non-contact aggression in silverbacks living in all-male as compared to mixed-sex groups. The results further reiterate that all-male groups are a feasible, long-term housing strategy for male gorillas in zoos and highlight important considerations for male management including: introduction of males in immaturity, delayed formation of breeding groups until males reach social as well as physical maturity, and the role of dominance-related behaviours, as opposed to escalated aggression, in adult male interactions.

Here we sequence to high coverage a total of 79 wild-and captive-born individuals representing all six great ape species and seven subspecies and report 88.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. Our analysis provides support for genetically distinct populations within each species, signals of gene flow, and the split of common chimpanzees into two distinct groups: Nigeria-Cameroon/western and central/eastern populations. We find extensive inbreeding in almost all wild populations, with eastern gorillas being the most extreme. Inferred effective population sizes have varied radically over time in different lineages and this appears to have a profound effect on the genetic diversity at, or close to, genes in almost all species. We discover and assign 1,982 loss-of-function variants throughout the human and great ape lineages, determining that the rate of gene loss has not been different in the human branch compared to other internal branches in the great ape phylogeny. This comprehensive catalogue of great ape genome diversity provides a framework for understanding evolution and a resource for more effective management of wild and captive great ape populations."
Unravelling the Functional Biomechanics of Dental Features and Tooth Wear,"['Benazzi, S', 'Nguyen, HN', 'Kullmer, O', 'Hublin, JJ', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0069990,JUL 23 2013,5,"Most of the morphological features recognized in hominin teeth, particularly the topography of the occlusal surface, are generally interpreted as an evolutionary functional adaptation for mechanical food processing. In this respect, we can also expect that the general architecture of a tooth reflects a response to withstand the high stresses produced during masticatory loadings. Here we use an engineering approach, finite element analysis (FEA), with an advanced loading concept derived from individual occlusal wear information to evaluate whether some dental traits usually found in hominin and extant great ape molars, such as the trigonid crest, the entoconid-hypoconulid crest and the protostylid have important biomechanical implications. For this purpose, FEA was applied to 3D digital models of three Gorilla gorilla lower second molars (M-2) differing in wear stages. Our results show that in unworn and slightly worn M(2)s tensile stresses concentrate in the grooves of the occlusal surface. In such condition, the trigonid and the entoconid-hypoconulid crests act to reinforce the crown locally against stresses produced along the mesiodistal groove. Similarly, the protostylid is shaped like a buttress to suffer the high tensile stresses concentrated in the deep buccal groove. These dental traits are less functional in the worn M-2, because tensile stresses decrease physiologically in the crown with progressing wear due to the enlargement of antagonistic contact areas and changes in loading direction from oblique to nearly parallel direction to the dental axis. This suggests that the wear process might have a crucial influence in the evolution and structural adaptation of molars enabling to endure bite stresses and reduce tooth failure throughout the lifetime of an individual."

The role of many wildlife species as reservoirs for arthropod-borne viral pathogens is poorly understood. We investigated the exposure history of various African wildlife species from the Congo basin to mosquito-borne flaviviruses and alphaviruses by testing archived serum samples. Sera from 24 African forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), 34 African elephants (Loxodonta africana), 40 duikers (Cephalophus and Philantomba spp.), 25 mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx), 32 mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), five Grauer's gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri), two L'Hoest's monkeys (Cercopithecus lhoesti), two golden monkeys (Cercopithecus kandti), and three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) sampled between 1991 and 2009 were tested for antibodies against chikungunya virus (CHIKV), o'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), West Nile virus (WNV), dengue 2 virus (DENV-2), and yellow fever virus (YFV) by plaque reduction neutralization test. Specific neutralizing antibodies against ONNV were found in African forest buffalo in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Gabon, duikers in the DRC, and mandrills in Gabon, providing novel evidence of enzootic circulation of ONNV in these countries. African forest buffalo in the DRC and Gabon also demonstrated evidence of exposure to CHIKV, WNV, and DENV-2, while mandrills in Gabon were antibody positive for CHIKV, DENV-2, WNV, and YFV. All of the elephants tested had a strong neutralizing antibody response to WNV. We also document results from a survey of gorillas for arboviruses, of which 4/32 (13%) had antibody to an alphavirus or flavivirus. Overall, our results demonstrate a high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against multiple arboviruses in wildlife in equatorial Africa."

Humans may nonetheless share a subset of non-verbal numerical skills, available soon after birth and considered the evolutionary foundation of more complex numerical reasoning, with other animals. These skills are thought to be based on the two systems: the object file system which processes small values (< 3) and the analogue magnitude system which processes large magnitudes (> 4). Infants' ability to discriminate 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3, 2 vs. 3, but not 1 vs. 4, seems to indicate that the two systems are independent, implying that the conception of a continuous number processing system is based on precursors that appear to be interrupted at or about the number four. The findings from the study being presented here indicating that chicks are able to make a series of discriminations regarding that borderline number (1 vs. 4, 1 vs. 5, 2 vs. 4) support the hypothesis that there is continuity in the number system which processes both small and large numerousness."
A Genome-Wide Survey of Genetic Variation in Gorillas Using Reduced Representation Sequencing,"['Scally, A', 'Yngvadottir, B', 'Xue, YL', 'Ayub, Q', 'Durbin, R', 'Tyler-Smith, C']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0065066,JUN 4 2013,3,"All non-human great apes are endangered in the wild, and it is therefore important to gain an understanding of their demography and genetic diversity. Whole genome assembly projects have provided an invaluable foundation for understanding genetics in all four genera, but to date genetic studies of multiple individuals within great ape species have largely been confined to mitochondrial DNA and a small number of other loci. Here, we present a genome-wide survey of genetic variation in gorillas using a reduced representation sequencing approach, focusing on the two lowland subspecies. We identify 3,006,670 polymorphic sites in 14 individuals: 12 western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and 2 eastern lowland gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri). We find that the two species are genetically distinct, based on levels of heterozygosity and patterns of allele sharing. Focusing on the western lowland population, we observe evidence for population substructure, and a deficit of rare genetic variants suggesting a recent episode of population contraction. In western lowland gorillas, there is an elevation of variation towards telomeres and centromeres on the chromosomal scale. On a finer scale, we find substantial variation in genetic diversity, including a marked reduction close to the major histocompatibility locus, perhaps indicative of recent strong selection there. These findings suggest that despite their maintaining an overall level of genetic diversity equal to or greater than that of humans, population decline, perhaps associated with disease, has been a significant factor in recent and long-term pressures on wild gorilla populations."
"Leaf Surface Roughness Elicits Leaf Swallowing Behavior in Captive Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and Bonobos (P-paniscus), but not in Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) or Orangutans (Pongo abelii)","['Menzel, C', 'Fowler, A', 'Tennie, C', 'Call, J']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-013-9679-7,JUN 2013,2,"Researchers have described apparently self-medicative behaviors for a variety of nonhuman species including birds and primates. Wild chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas have been observed to swallow rough leaves without chewing, a behavior proposed to be self-medicative and to aid control of intestinal parasites. Researchers have hypothesized that the presence of hairs on the leaf surface elicits the behavior. We investigated the acquisition and the underlying mechanisms of leaf swallowing. We provided 42 captive great apes (24 chimpanzees, six bonobos, six gorillas, and six orangutans) with both rough-surfaced and hairless plants. None of the subjects had previously been observed to engage in leaf swallowing behavior and were therefore assumed na < ve. Two chimpanzees and one bonobo swallowed rough-surfaced leaves spontaneously without chewing them. In a social setup six more chimpanzees acquired the behavior. None of the gorillas or orangutans showed leaf swallowing. Because this behavior occurred in na < ve individuals, we conclude that it is part of the behavioral repertoire of chimpanzees and bonobos. Social learning is thus not strictly required for the acquisition of leaf swallowing, but it may still facilitate its expression. The fact that apes always chewed leaves of hairless control plants before swallowing, i.e., normal feeding behavior, indicates that the surface structure of leaves is indeed a determinant for initiating leaf swallowing in apes where it occurs."
The Influence of Transect Use by Local People and Reuse of Transects for Repeated Surveys on Nesting in Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and Central Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in Southeast Cameroon,"['Tagg, N', 'Willie, J']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-013-9681-0,JUN 2013,5,"Monitoring populations of endangered species over time is necessary to guide and evaluate conservation efforts. This is particularly important for nonprotected areas that ensure connectivity between protected populations but are prone to uncontrolled hunting pressure. We investigated whether use of transects by local people and transect reuse for repeated surveys influence great ape nesting and bias results. We conducted simultaneous marked nest count surveys over 12 mo on established and newly opened transects in a nonprotected area subject to traditional heavy use by local people and recorded forest composition and signs of human activity. Chimpanzee and gorilla density estimates and encounter rates per kilometer were lower on established transects than on new ones. A generalized linear model indicated that hunting activity, distance to a regularly used forest trail, and transect type (old or new) predicted chimpanzee nest abundance, and distance to the trail and transect type predicted gorilla nest abundance, with no effect of habitat type (percentage suitable habitat) for either species. We, therefore, suggest that the difference in great ape nesting is a result of high levels of hunting by local people on established transects and forest trails. Our results support the use of repeated line transect surveys for monitoring great ape populations in many circumstances, although we advocate taking precautions in nonprotected areas, to avoid the bias imposed by use of established transects for hunting."
Bushmeat hunting changes regeneration of African rainforests,"['Effiom, EO', 'Nunez-Iturri, G', 'Smith, HG', 'Ottosson, U', 'Olsson, O']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rspb.2013.0246,MAY 22 2013,20,"To assess ecological consequences of bushmeat hunting in African lowland rainforests, we compared paired sites, with high and low hunting pressure, in three areas of southeastern Nigeria. In hunted sites, populations of important seed dispersers-both small and large primates (including the Cross River gorilla, Gorilla gorilla diehli)-were drastically reduced. Large rodents were more abundant in hunted sites, even though they are hunted. Hunted and protected sites had similar mature tree communities dominated by primate-dispersed species. In protected sites, seedling communities were similar in composition to the mature trees, but in hunted sites species with other dispersal modes dominated among seedlings. Seedlings emerging 1 year after clearing of all vegetation in experimental plots showed a similar pattern to the standing seedlings. This study thus verifies the transforming effects of bushmeat hunting on plant communities of tropical forests and is one of the first studies to do so for the African continent."

At present, however, data on how brain size changes over the course of development are only available from chimpanzees and modern humans. In this study, we examined brain growth in wild Virunga mountain gorillas using data derived from necropsy reports (N = 34) and endocranial volume (EV) measurements (N = 86). The youngest individual in our sample was a 10-day-old neonatal male with a brain mass of 208 g, representing 42% of the adult male average. Our results demonstrate that Virunga mountain gorillas reach maximum adult-like brain mass by 3-4 years of age; adult-sized EV is reached by the time the first permanent molars emerge. This is in contrast to the pattern observed in chimpanzees, which despite their smaller absolute brain size, reportedly attain adult brain mass approximately 1 year later than Virunga mountain gorillas. Our findings demonstrate that brain growth is completed early in Virunga mountain gorillas compared to other great apes studied thus far, in a manner that appears to be linked with other life history characteristics of this population.

Studying the impact of such structural variations on defined molecular processes can provide valuable insights on how genome structural organization contributes to organismal evolution. Here, we show that telomeres on chromosome arms carrying subtelomeric heterochromatic caps in the chimpanzee, which are completely absent in humans, replicate later than telomeres on chromosome arms without caps. In gorilla, on the other hand, a proportion of the subtelomeric heterochromatic caps present in most chromosome arms are associated with large blocks of telomere-like sequences that follow a replication program different from that of bona fide telomeres. Strikingly, telomere-containing RNA accumulates extrachromosomally in gorilla mitotic cells, suggesting that at least some aspects of telomere-containing RNA biogenesis have diverged in gorilla, perhaps in concert with the evolution of heterochromatic caps in this species."
Initiation of Joint Attention is Associated with Morphometric Variation in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex of Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Hopkins, WD', 'Taglialatela, JP', 'AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22120,MAY 2013,5,"In developing human children, joint attention (JA) is an important preverbal skill fundamental to the development of language. Poor JA skills have been described as a behavioral risk factor for some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder. It has been hypothesized that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays an important role in the development of JA in human children. Here, we tested whether the morphometry and lateralization of the ACC differed between chimpanzees that were classified as either consistently or inconsistently engaging in JA with a human experimenter. Results showed that chimpanzees that performed poorly on the JA task had larger gray matter (GM) volumes in the ACC compared to apes that performed well on the task. In addition, both population-level asymmetries and sex differences in the volume of GM were found within the ACC. Specifically, females had relatively larger GM volumes in two of the three subregions of the ACC compared to males, and significant leftward asymmetries were found for two of the subregions whereas a rightward bias was observed in the third. Based on these findings, we suggest that the ACC plays an important role in mediating JA, not just in humans, but also chimpanzees. We further suggest that the differences found between groups may reflect inherent differences in the amount of white matter within the ACC, thereby suggesting reduced connectivity between the ACC and other cortical regions in chimpanzees with poor JA skills.

In this study, invisible (Experiment 1) and visible (Experiment 2) displacement problems were administered to determine whether domestic dogs' and gray wolves' cognitive capacities to infer the position of a hidden object differ. The results revealed that adult dogs and wolves performed similarly in searching for disappearing objects: Both species succeeded the visible displacement tasks but failed the invisible displacement problems. We conclude that physical cognition for finding hidden objects in domestic dogs and gray wolves is alike and unrelated to the process of domestication."

This study was the first to assess the phenomenology, demography and aetiology of this behaviour in captive gorillas across the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) population. A survey was sent to 52 AZA institutions housing western lowland gorillas. Hair-plucking behaviour occurred in 15% of the surveyed population with 62% of institutions housing a hair plucker. Individuals were most likely to self-pluck using their fingers. Individuals that were exposed as youngsters to a hair-plucking group member were significantly more likely to develop the behaviour themselves. There was also a trend toward solitary individuals being more likely to perform this behaviour. Future research needs include identifying hormonal correlates to this behaviour, understanding its relationship to acute or chronic stressors, and examining what causes this behaviour to fluctuate in frequency once it has developed."

Despite the magnitude of this reservoir, it is unknown whether apes represent a source of human infections. Here, we used Plasmodium species-specific PCR, single-genome amplification, and 454 sequencing to screen humans from remote areas of southern Cameroon for ape Laverania infections. Among 1,402 blood samples, we found 1,000 to be Plasmodium mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) positive, all of which contained human parasites as determined by sequencing and/or restriction enzyme digestion. To exclude low-abundance infections, we subjected 514 of these samples to 454 sequencing, targeting a region of the mtDNA genome that distinguishes ape from human Laverania species. Using algorithms specifically developed to differentiate rare Plasmodium variants from 454-sequencing error, we identified single and mixed-species infections with P. falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, and/or Plasmodium ovale. However, none of the human samples contained ape Laverania parasites, including the gorilla precursor of P. falciparum. To characterize further the diversity of P. falciparum in Cameroon, we used single-genome amplification to amplify 3.4-kb mtDNA fragments from 229 infected humans. Phylogenetic analysis identified 62 new variants, all of which clustered with extant P. falciparum, providing further evidence that P. falciparum emerged following a single gorilla-to-human transmission. Thus, unlike Plasmodium knowlesi-infected macaques in southeast Asia, African apes harboring Laverania parasites do not seem to serve as a recurrent source of human malaria, a finding of import to ongoing control and eradication measures."

Although this seems to be supported by studies on a range of domesticated (including dogs, goats and horses) and wild (including wolves and chimpanzees) animals, there is also evidence that exposure to humans positively influences the ability of both wild and domesticated animals to follow these same cues. Here, we test the performance of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) on an object choice task that provides them with visual-only cues given by humans about the location of hidden food. Captive elephants are interesting candidates for investigating how both domestication and human exposure may impact cue-following as they represent a non-domesticated species with almost constant human interaction. As a group, the elephants (n = 7) in our study were unable to follow pointing, body orientation or a combination of both as honest signals of food location. They were, however, able to follow vocal commands with which they were already familiar in a novel context, suggesting the elephants are able to follow cues if they are sufficiently salient. Although the elephants' inability to follow the visual cues provides partial support for the domestication hypothesis, an alternative explanation is that elephants may rely more heavily on other sensory modalities, specifically olfaction and audition. Further research will be needed to rule out this alternative explanation."

These species present five apomorphies, including shared expressions of Carabelli's upper first molar (UM1) and protostylid lower first molar (LM1). Five synapomorphies are also evident between them and monophyletic Homo habilis/rudolfensis + H. erectus. Finally, a South African australopith + Homo clade is supported by four shared derived states, including identical LM1 cusp 7 expression."

We conducted surveys along 199 line transects and installed camera traps on 99 of these transects to document mammal presence and abundance. We used generalized linear mixed-effect models to document associations between variables related to the ecosystem (land cover, topography, and hydrology), roads (coating, width of rights of way, condition, type of vehicle used on the road, traffic level, affiliation of users, and general type of road), and other human disturbances (urbanization, agriculture, hunting, logging, gathering, and industrial activities) and the abundance or presence of 17 species or groups of mammals including elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), buffalo (Syncerus caffer), sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekei), red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), smaller ungulates, gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), side-striped jackal (Canis adustus), carnivores, monkeys, and large rodents. Some types of roads and other human disturbances were negatively associated with the abundance or presence of elephants, buffalos, gorillas, sitatungas, some monkeys, and duikers. The pattern of associations of mammals with roads and other human disturbances was diverse and included positive associations with road presence (red river hog, some monkeys, and duikers), agriculture (sitatunga, small carnivores, and large rodents) and industrial activities (sitatunga, red river hog, red duikers, and side-striped jackal). Our results suggest that the community of mammals we studied was mostly affected by hunting, agriculture, and urbanization, which are facilitated by road presence. We recommend increased regulation of agriculture, hunting, and road building in the area."
Sexual Dimorphism and Facial Growth Beyond Dental Maturity in Great Apes and Gibbons,"['Balolia, KL', 'Soligo, C', 'Lockwood, CA']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-013-9666-z,APR 2013,2,"The great apes and gibbons are characterized by extensive variation in degree of body size and cranial dimorphism, but although some studies have investigated how sexual dimorphism in body mass is attained in these species, for the majority of taxa concerned, no corresponding work has explored the full extent of how sexual dimorphism is attained in the facial skeleton. In addition, most studies of sexual dimorphism combine dentally mature individuals into a single ""adult"" category, thereby assuming that no substantial changes in size or dimorphism take place after dental maturity. We investigated degree and pattern of male and female facial growth in Pan troglodytes troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, and Hylobates lar after dental maturity through cross-sectional analyses of linear measurements and geometric mean values of the facial skeleton and age-ranking of individuals based on molar occlusal wear. Results show that overall facial size continues to increase after dental maturity is reached in males and females of Gorilla gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus, as well as in the females of Hylobates lar. In male Pongo pygmaeus, adult growth patterns imply the presence of a secondary growth spurt in craniofacial dimensions. There is suggestive evidence of growth beyond dental maturity in the females of Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Pan paniscus, but not in the males of those species. The results show the presence of statistically significant facial size dimorphism in young adults of Pan paniscus and Hylobates lar, and of near statistical significance in Pan troglodytes troglodytes, but not in older adults of those species; adults of Gorilla gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus are sexually dimorphic at all ages after dental maturity. The presence of sex-specific growth patterns in these hominoid taxa indicates a complex relationship between socioecological selective pressures and growth of the facial skeleton."

Here, we survey DNA sequence variation in the OAS gene cluster on chromosome 12 and provide strong evidence that a haplotype extending for similar to 185 kb introgressed from Neandertals. This haplotype is nearly restricted to Eurasians and is estimated to have diverged from the Neandertal sequence similar to 125 kya. Despite the potential for novel functional variation, the observed frequency of this haplotype is consistent with neutral introgression. This is the second locus in the human genome, after STAT2, carrying distinct haplotypes that appear to have introgressed separately from both Neandertals and Denisova."
Can Black-and-White Ruffed Lemurs (Varecia variegata) Solve Object Permanence Tasks?,"['Mallavarapu, S', 'Perdue, BM', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Maple, TL']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22118,APR 2013,2,"We examined object permanence in black-and-white-ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata) at Zoo Atlanta. A series of visible and invisible displacement tasks with suitable controls were presented to five adult subjects. Subjects performed significantly above chance on all regular tasks, except for the double invisible displacements. Subjects failed visible and invisible controls. Failure on the control trials did not appear to be because subjects used the last box touched strategy (subjects did not choose the last box touched significantly more than expected by chance). However, a substantial percentage of choices was made to the last box touched by the experimenter. There was no significant difference between this percentage, and the percentage of choices made to the baited box (on both visible and invisible controls), which indicates that subjects were drawn to both boxes which the experimenter visited/touched, and thus failed the controls. Based on the results from the present study, we believe that there is no evidence that black-and-white ruffed lemurs understand visible and invisible tasks in the traditional object permanence battery.

Head-Mounted Eye Tracking of a Chimpanzee under Naturalistic Conditions,"['Kano, F', 'Tomonaga, M']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0059785,MAR 27 2013,5,"This study offers a new method for examining the bodily, manual, and eye movements of a chimpanzee at the micro-level. A female chimpanzee wore a lightweight head-mounted eye tracker (60 Hz) on her head while engaging in daily interactions with the human experimenter. The eye tracker recorded her eye movements accurately while the chimpanzee freely moved her head, hands, and body. Three video cameras recorded the bodily and manual movements of the chimpanzee from multiple angles. We examined how the chimpanzee viewed the experimenter in this interactive setting and how the eye movements were related to the ongoing interactive contexts and actions. We prepared two experimentally defined contexts in each session: a face-to-face greeting phase upon the appearance of the experimenter in the experimental room, and a subsequent face-to-face task phase that included manual gestures and fruit rewards. Overall, the general viewing pattern of the chimpanzee, measured in terms of duration of individual fixations, length of individual saccades, and total viewing duration of the experimenter's face/body, was very similar to that observed in previous eye-tracking studies that used non-interactive situations, despite the differences in the experimental settings. However, the chimpanzee viewed the experimenter and the scene objects differently depending on the ongoing context and actions. The chimpanzee viewed the experimenter's face and body during the greeting phase, but viewed the experimenter's face and hands as well as the fruit reward during the task phase. These differences can be explained by the differential bodily/manual actions produced by the chimpanzee and the experimenter during each experimental phase (i.e., greeting gestures, task cueing). Additionally, the chimpanzee's viewing pattern varied depending on the identity of the experimenter (i.e., the chimpanzee's prior experience with the experimenter). These methods and results offer new possibilities for examining the natural gaze behavior of chimpanzees."

In addition, most of them are endangered. For these reasons, non-invasive sampling is especially useful in primates including lemurs. A key issue in conservation and ecological studies is to identify the sex of the sampled individuals to investigate sex-biased dispersal, parentage, social organization and population sex ratio. Several molecular tests of sex are available in apes and monkeys, but only a handful of them work in the lemuriform clade. Among these tests, the coamplification of the SRY gene with the amelogenin X gene using strepsirhine-specific X primers seems particularly promising, but the reliability and validity of this sexing test have not been properly assessed yet. In this study, we (i) show that this molecular sexing test works on three additional lemur species (Microcebus tavaratra, Propithecus coronatus and P. verreauxi) from two previously untested genera and one previously untested family, suggesting that these markers are likely to be universal among lemurs and other strepsirrhines; (ii) provide the first evidence that this PCR-based sexing test works on degraded DNA obtained from noninvasive samples; (iii) validate the approach using a large number of known-sex individuals and a multiple-tubes approach, and show that mismatches between the field sex and the final molecular consensus sex occur in less than 10% of all the samples and that most of these mismatches were likely linked to incorrect sex determinations in the field rather than genotyping errors.

Olive baboons communicate intentionally by pointing,"['Meunier, H', 'Prieur, J', 'Vauclair, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-012-0558-y,MAR 2013,7,"A pointing gesture creates a referential triangle that incorporates distant objects into the relationship between the signaller and the gesture's recipient. Pointing was long assumed to be specific to our species. However, recent reports have shown that pointing emerges spontaneously in captive chimpanzees and can be learned by monkeys. Studies have demonstrated that both human children and great apes use manual gestures (e.g. pointing), and visual and vocal signals, to communicate intentionally about out-of-reach objects. Our study looked at how monkeys understand and use their learned pointing behaviour, asking whether it is a conditioned, reinforcement-dependent response or whether monkeys understand it to be a mechanism for manipulating the attention of a partner (e.g. a human). We tested nine baboons that had been trained to exhibit pointing, using operant conditioning. More specifically, we investigated their ability to communicate intentionally about the location of an unreachable food reward in three contexts that differed according to the human partner's attentional state. In each context, we quantified the frequency of communicative behaviour (auditory and visual signals), including gestures and gaze alternations between the distal food and the human partner. We found that the baboons were able to modulate their manual and visual communicative signals as a function of the experimenter's attentional state. These findings indicate that monkeys can intentionally produce pointing gestures and understand that a human recipient must be looking at the pointing gesture for them to perform their attention-directing actions. The referential and intentional nature of baboons' communicative signalling is discussed."
"Long-Term Temporal and Spatial Dynamics of Food Availability for Endangered Mountain Gorillas in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda","['Grueter, CC', 'Ndamiyabo, F', 'Plumptre, AJ', 'Abavandimwe, D', 'Mundry, R', 'Fawcett, KA', 'Robbins, MM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22102,MAR 2013,2,"Monitoring temporal and spatial changes in the resource availability of endangered species contributes to their conservation. The number of critically endangered mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in the Virunga Volcano population has doubled over the past three decades, but no studies have examined how food availability has changed during that period. First, we assessed if the plant species consumed by the gorillas have changed in abundance and distribution during the past two decades. In 20092010, we replicated a study conducted in 19881989 by measuring the frequency, density, and biomass of plant species consumed by the gorillas in 496 plots (ca. 6 km2) in the Karisoke study area in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda. We expected to observe a decreased presence of major gorilla food plants as a likely result of density-dependent overharvesting by gorillas. Among the five most frequently consumed species (composing approximately 70% of the gorilla's diet, excluding bamboo), two have decreased in availability and abundance, while three have increased. Some species have undergone shifts in their altitudinal distribution, possibly due to regional climatic changes. Second, we made baseline measurements of food availability in a larger area currently utilized by the gorillas. In the extended sampling (n = 473 plots) area (ca. 25 km2), of the five most frequently consumed species, two were not significantly different in frequency from the re-sampled area, while two occurred significantly less frequently, and one occurred significantly more frequently. We discuss the potential impact of gorilla-induced herbivory on changes of vegetation abundance. The changes in the species most commonly consumed by the gorillas could affect their nutrient intake and stresses the importance of monitoring the interrelation among plant population dynamics, species density, and resource use.

Study design Case series.

Animals Six gorillas, two males and four females, aged 9-52 years and weighing 63-155 kg.

Methods The gorillas were given zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride 0.2 +/- 0.05 mg kg(-1) per os twice daily for 3 days for premedication. On the day of anaesthesia the dose of zuclopenthixol was increased to 0.27 mg kg(-1) and given once early in the morning. Anaesthesia was induced with medetomidine 0.04 +/- 0.004 mg kg(-1), midazolam 0.048 +/- 0.003 mg kg(-1) and ketamine 4.9 +/- 0.4 mg kg(-1) intramuscularly (IM). Upon recumbency, the trachea was intubated and anaesthesia was maintained on 1-2% isoflurane in oxygen. Physiological parameters were monitored every 10 minutes and arterial blood gas analysis was performed once 30-50 minutes after initial darting. At the end of the procedure, 42-115 minutes after initial darting, immobilisation was antagonized with atipamezole 0.21 +/- 0.03 mg kg(-1) and sarmazenil 5 +/- 0.4 mu g kg(-1) IM.

Results Recumbency was reached within 10 minutes in five out of six animals. One animal required two additional darts before intubation was feasible. Heart rate ranged from 60 to 85 beats minute(-1), respiratory rate from 17 to 46 breaths minute(-1) and temperature from 36.9 to 38.3 degrees C. No spontaneous recoveries were observed and anaesthetic level was stable. Blood gas analyses revealed mild respiratory acidosis, and mean PaO2 was 24.87 +/- 17.16 kPa (187 +/- 129 mmHg) with all values being above 13.4 kPa (101 mmHg). Recovery was smooth and gorillas were sitting within 25 minutes.

Conclusion and clinical relevance The drug combination proved to be effective in anaesthetizing captive gorillas of various ages and both sexes, with minimal cardio-respiratory changes."

We moved away from testing hypotheses rooted in the activities of modern humans, by testing whether these associations are ancestral and one side of a trade-off between fitness costs and benefits. We examined personality predictors of survival in 283 captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) followed for 18 years. We found that of four gorilla personality dimensions-dominance, extraversion, neuroticism and agreeableness-extraversion was associated with longer survival. This effect could not be explained by demographic information or husbandry practices. These findings suggest that understanding how extraversion and other personality domains influence longevity requires investigating the evolutionary bases of this association in nonhuman primates and other species."

People either learn about others by direct interaction or by observing third-party interactions or gossip. An important question is whether other animal species, especially our closest living relatives, the nonhuman great apes, also form reputations of others. In Study 1, chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and 2.5-year-old human children experienced a nice experimenter who tried to give food/toys to the subject and a mean experimenter who interrupted the food/toy giving. In studies 2 and 3, nonhuman great apes and human children could only passively observe a similar interaction, in which a nice experimenter and a mean experimenter interacted with a third party. Orangutans and 2.5-year-old human children preferred to approach the nice experimenter rather than the mean one after having directly experienced their respective behaviors. Orangutans, chimpanzees, and 2.5-year-old human children also took into account experimenter actions toward third parties in forming reputations. These studies show that the human ability to form direct and indirect reputation judgment is already present in young children and shared with at least some of the other great apes."
The Effect of Body Orientation on Judgments of Human Visual Attention in Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Bania, AE', 'Stromberg, EE']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0027261,FEB 2013,5,"The ability to appreciate the attentional states of others is an important element used in discerning the presence of Theory of Mind in an individual. Whether primates are able to recognize attention, and further, use such information to predict behavior, remains contentious. In this study, six western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) were tested under different conditions that aimed to investigate not only their understanding of what a human experimenter sees, but also what information they use to make these judgments. In all experiments the gorillas selected between two human experimenters, one who could see them and one who could not. In Experiment 1 the gorillas' performance was significantly above chance in conditions where they judged body orientation, head orientation, and eyes. Experiment 2 showed that the gorillas' initial judgments of attention may be based on body orientation rather than facial cues. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the gorillas were better able to utilize facial cues in some conditions, when these cues were paired with a more neutral body orientation. These findings suggest that the gorillas are using a hierarchical approach to determining visual attention, by making an immediate decision based on the most salient cue-body orientation. However, when body orientation is more ambiguous their ability to judge the less prominent cues of the face and eyes does improve."
"Placental invasion, preeclampsia risk and adaptive molecular evolution at the origin of the great apes: Evidence from genome-wide analyses","['Crosley, EJ', 'Elliot, MG', 'Christians, JK', 'Crespi, BJ']",PLACENTA,10.1016/j.placenta.2012.12.001,FEB 2013,10,"Introduction: Recent evidence from chimpanzees and gorillas has raised doubts that preeclampsia is a uniquely human disease. The deep extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion and spiral artery remodeling that characterizes our placenta (and is abnormal in preeclampsia) is shared within great apes, setting Homininae apart from Hylobatidae and Old World Monkeys, which show much shallower trophoblast invasion and limited spiral artery remodeling. We hypothesize that the evolution of a more invasive placenta in the lineage ancestral to the great apes involved positive selection on genes crucial to EVT invasion and spiral artery remodeling. Furthermore, identification of placentally-expressed genes under selection in this lineage may identify novel genes involved in placental development.

Methods: We tested for positive selection in approximately 18,000 genes using the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous amino acid substitution for protein-coding DNA. DAVID Bioinformatics Resources identified biological processes enriched in positively selected genes, including processes related to EVT invasion and spiral artery remodeling.

Results: Analyses revealed 295 and 264 genes under significant positive selection on the branches ancestral to Hominidae (Human, Chimp, Gorilla, Orangutan) and Homininae (Human, Chimp, Gorilla), respectively. Gene ontology analysis of these gene sets demonstrated significant enrichments for several functional gene clusters relevant to preeclampsia risk, and sets of placentally-expressed genes that have been linked with preeclampsia and/or trophoblast invasion in other studies.

Conclusion: Our study represents a novel approach to the identification of candidate genes and amino acid residues involved in placental pathologies by implicating them in the evolution of highly-invasive placenta. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Human handedness: An inherited evolutionary trait,"['Forrester, GS', 'Quaresmini, C', 'Leavens, DA', 'Mareschal, D', 'Thomas, MSC']",BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH,10.1016/j.bbr.2012.09.037,JAN 15 2013,22,"Our objective was to demonstrate that human population-level, right-handedness, is not species specific, precipitated from language areas in the brain, but rather is context specific and inherited from a behavior common to both humans and great apes. In general, previous methods of assessing human handedness have neglected to consider the context of action, or employ methods suitable for direct comparison across species. We employed a bottom-up, context-sensitive method to quantitatively assess manual actions in right-handed, typically developing children during naturalistic behavior. By classifying the target to which participants directed a manual action, as animate (social partner, self) or inanimate (non-living functional objects), we found that children demonstrated a significant right-hand bias for manual actions directed toward inanimate targets, but not for manual actions directed toward animate targets. This pattern was revealed at both the group and individual levels. We used a focal video sampling, corpus data-mining approach to allow for direct comparisons with captive gorillas (Forrester et al. Animal Cognition 2011;14(6):903-7) and chimpanzees (Forrester et al. Animal Cognition, in press). Comparisons of handedness patters support the view that population-level, human handedness, and its origin in cerebral lateralization is not a new or human-unique characteristic. These data are consistent with the theory that human right-handedness is a trait developed through tool use that was inherited from an ancestor common to both humans and great apes.

zipHMMlib: a highly optimised HMM library exploiting repetitions in the input to speed up the forward algorithm,"['Sand, A', 'Kristiansen, M', 'Pedersen, CNS', 'Mailund, T']",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,10.1186/1471-2105-14-339,NOV 22 2013,1,"Background: Hidden Markov models are widely used for genome analysis as they combine ease of modelling with efficient analysis algorithms. Calculating the likelihood of a model using the forward algorithm has worst case time complexity linear in the length of the sequence and quadratic in the number of states in the model. For genome analysis, however, the length runs to millions or billions of observations, and when maximising the likelihood hundreds of evaluations are often needed. A time efficient forward algorithm is therefore a key ingredient in an efficient hidden Markov model library.

Results: We have built a software library for efficiently computing the likelihood of a hidden Markov model. The library exploits commonly occurring substrings in the input to reuse computations in the forward algorithm. In a pre-processing step our library identifies common substrings and builds a structure over the computations in the forward algorithm which can be reused. This analysis can be saved between uses of the library and is independent of concrete hidden Markov models so one preprocessing can be used to run a number of different models. Using this library, we achieve up to 78 times shorter wall-clock time for realistic whole-genome analyses with a real and reasonably complex hidden Markov model. In one particular case the analysis was performed in less than 8 minutes compared to 9.6 hours for the previously fastest library.

Conclusions: We have implemented the preprocessing procedure and forward algorithm as a C++ library, zipHMM, with Python bindings for use in scripts. The library is available at http://birc.au.dk/software/ziphmm/."

The specific strategies of three groups of pathogens for crossing the species barrier among primates will be discussed. In Africa, gorillas and chimpanzees have succumbed for years to simultaneous epizootics (i.e.. ""multi-emergence'') of Ebola virus in places where they are in contact with Chiropters, which could be animal reservoirs of these viruses. Human epidemics often follow these major outbreaks. Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) have an ancient history of coevolution and many interspecific exchanges with their natural hosts. Chimpanzee and gorilla SIVs have crossed the species barrier at different times and places, leading to the emergence of HIV-1 and HIV-2. Other retroviruses, such as the Simian T-Lymphotropic Viruses and Foamiviruses, have also a unique ancient or recent history of crossing the species barrier. The identification of gorilla Plasmodium parasites that are genetically close to P. falciparum suggests that gorillas were the source of the deadly human P. falciparum. Nonhuman plasmodium species that can infect humans represent an underestimated risk."

However, scanning electron microscopy yields conflicting results with one study of Oreopithecus showing folivory and another indicating a coarser diet was consumed. To address this debate, the dietary proclivities of the well-known IGF 11778 Oreopithecus bambolii specimen are reconstructed by comparing the enamel texture properties of this specimen to extant Alouatta palliata (n = 11), Cebus apella (n = 13), Gorilla gorilla (n = 9), Lophocebus albigena (n = 15), Pan troglodytes (n = 17) and Trachypithecus cristatus (n = 12). Dental microwear is captured by scanning facet 9, a Phase II facet on the hypoconid surface, using white-light confocal microscopy at 100x. The scanning was followed by scale-sensitive fractal analysis, yielding four texture characteristics. These were ranked before ANOVA with post-hoc tests of significance and multivariate analyses were conducted. Oreopithecus specimen IGF 11778 does not match any of the extant taxa consistently but in some analyses is associated with Lophocebus, and secondarily with Pan, Gorilla and Cebus outliers suggesting mixed-fruit and hard-object feeding characterized at least a portion of its diet. The partially open habitat of late Miocene Baccinello may have had resources with mechanically resistant foods, or foods found near ground level were consumed. Hard, brittle foods, insects, and or extraneous grit may have contributed to the greater use-wear complexity of the enamel surface observed in IGF 11778 compared to extant folivores. IGF 11778 does not exhibit the degree of anisotropy characterizing Trachypithecus and Alouatta. The partial resemblance of IGF 11778 to some great ape specimens may indicate intermittent extractive and or terrestrial foraging."

Here, we studied one of these palindromes, P6, in order to illuminate the dynamics of the gene conversion process. We genotyped ten paralogous sequence variants (PSVs) within the arms of P6 in 378 Y chromosomes whose evolutionary relationships within the SNP-defined Y phylogeny are known. This allowed the identification of 146 historical gene conversion events involving individual PSVs, occurring at a rate of 2.9-8.4x10(-4) events per generation. A consideration of the nature of nucleotide change and the ancestral state of each PSV showed that the conversion process was significantly biased towards the fixation of G or C nucleotides (GC-biased), and also towards the ancestral state. Determination of haplotypes by long-PCR allowed likely co-conversion of PSVs to be identified, and suggested that conversion tract lengths are large, with a mean of 2068 bp, and a maximum in excess of 9 kb. Despite the frequent formation of recombination intermediates implied by the rapid observed gene conversion activity, resolution via crossover is rare: only three inversions within P6 were detected in the sample. An analysis of chimpanzee and gorilla P6 orthologs showed that the ancestral state bias has existed in all three species, and comparison of human and chimpanzee sequences with the gorilla outgroup confirmed that GC bias of the conversion process has apparently been active in both the human and chimpanzee lineages."

However, the dynamics of DNA methylation changes between humans and their closest relatives are still poorly understood. We performed a comparative analysis of CpG methylation patterns between 9 humans and 23 primate samples including all species of great apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and orangutan) using Illumina Methylation450 bead arrays. Our analysis identified similar to 800 genes with significantly altered methylation patterns among the great apes, including similar to 170 genes with a methylation pattern unique to human. Some of these are known to be involved in developmental and neurological features, suggesting that epigenetic changes have been frequent during recent human and primate evolution. We identified a significant positive relationship between the rate of coding variation and alterations of methylation at the promoter level, indicative of co-occurrence between evolution of protein sequence and gene regulation. In contrast, and supporting the idea that many phenotypic differences between humans and great apes are not due to amino acid differences, our analysis also identified 184 genes that are perfectly conserved at protein level between human and chimpanzee, yet show significant epigenetic differences between these two species. We conclude that epigenetic alterations are an important force during primate evolution and have been under-explored in evolutionary comparative genomics."

Using more than 40 years of data from up to 70% of the entire population, we found that only 1.7% of the infants that were born in the study had died from infanticide during group disintegrations. The rarity of such infanticide mainly reflects a low mortality rate of dominant males in one-male groups, and it does not dispel previous observations that infanticide occurs during group disintegrations. After including infanticide from causes other than group disintegrations, infanticide victims represented up to 5.5% of the offspring born during the study, and they accounted for up to 21% of infant mortality. The overall rates of infanticide were 2-3 times higher in one-male groups than multimale groups, but those differences were not statistically significant. Infant mortality, the length of interbirth intervals, and the age of first reproduction were not significantly different between one-male versus multimale groups, so we found no significant fitness benefits for females to prefer multimale groups. In addition, we found limited evidence that female dispersal patterns reflect a preference for multimale groups. If the strength of selection is modest for females to avoid group disintegrations, than any preference for multimale groups may be slow to evolve. Alternatively, variability in male strength might give some one-male groups a lower infanticide risk than some multimale groups, which could explain why both types of groups remain common."
Gorillas' use of the escape response in object choice memory tests,"['Suda-King, C', 'Bania, AE', 'Stromberg, EE', 'Subiaul, F']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-012-0551-5,JAN 2013,5,"The ability to monitor and control one's own cognitive states, metacognition, is crucial for effective learning and problem solving. Although the literature on animal metacognition has grown considerably during last 15 years, there have been few studies examining whether great apes share such introspective abilities with humans. Here, we tested whether four gorillas could meet two criteria of animal metacognition, the increase in escape responses as a function of task difficulty and the chosen-forced performance advantage. During testing, the subjects participated in a series of object choice memory tests in which a preferable reward (two grapes) was placed under one of two or three blue cups. The apes were required to correctly select the baited blue cup in this primary test. Importantly, the subjects also had an escape response (a yellow cup), where they could obtain a secure but smaller reward (one grape) without taking the memory test. Although the gorillas received a relatively small number of trials and thus experienced little training, three gorillas significantly declined the memory tests more often in difficult trials (e.g., when the location of the preferred reward conflicted with side bias) than in easy trials (e.g., when there was no such conflict). Moreover, even when objective cues were eliminated that corresponded to task difficulty, one of the successful gorillas showed evidence suggestive of improved memory performance with the help of escape response by selectively avoiding trials in which he would be likely to err before the memory test actually proceeded. Together, these findings demonstrate that at least some gorillas may be able to make optimal choices on the basis of their own memory trace strength about the location of the preferred reward."

He was diagnosed with non-syndromic oculocutaneous albinism, i.e. white hair, light eyes, pink skin, photophobia and reduced visual acuity. Despite previous efforts to explain the genetic cause, this is still unknown. Here, we study the genetic cause of his albinism and making use of whole genome sequencing data we find a higher inbreeding coefficient compared to other gorillas.

Results: We successfully identified the causal genetic variant for Snowflake's albinism, a non-synonymous single nucleotide variant located in a transmembrane region of SLC45A2. This transporter is known to be involved in oculocutaneous albinism type 4 (OCA4) in humans. We provide experimental evidence that shows that this amino acid replacement alters the membrane spanning capability of this transmembrane region. Finally, we provide a comprehensive study of genome-wide patterns of autozygogosity revealing that Snowflake's parents were related, being this the first report of inbreeding in a wild born Western lowland gorilla.

Conclusions: In this study we demonstrate how the use of whole genome sequencing can be extended to link genotype and phenotype in non-model organisms and it can be a powerful tool in conservation genetics (e.g., inbreeding and genetic diversity) with the expected decrease in sequencing cost."

Here we describe the clone-based sequencing and subsequent annotation of the MHC region of the gorilla genome. Because the MHC is subject to extensive variation, both structural and sequence-wise, it is not readily amenable to study in whole genome shotgun sequence such as the recently published gorilla genome. The variation of the MHC also makes it of evolutionary interest and therefore we analyse the sequence in the context of human and chimpanzee. In our comparisons with human and re-annotated chimpanzee MHC sequence we find that gorilla has a trimodular RCCX cluster, versus the reference human bimodular cluster, and additional copies of Class I (pseudo)genes between Gogo-K and Gogo-A (the orthologues of HLA-K and -A). We also find that Gogo-H (and Patr-H) is coding versus the HLA-H pseudogene and, conversely, there is a Gogo-DQB2 pseudogene versus the HLA-DQB2 coding gene. Our analysis, which is freely available through the VEGA genome browser, provides the research community with a comprehensive dataset for comparative and evolutionary research of the MHC."
"The Cross River Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla diehli) at Mawambi Hills, South-West Cameroon: Habitat Suitability and Vulnerability to Anthropogenic Disturbance","['Etiendem, DN', 'Funwi-Gabga, N', 'Tagg, N', 'Hens, L', 'Indah, EK']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000345853,2013,3,"Only about 300 individuals of the Cross River gorilla (CRG; Gorilla gorilla diehli) survive today. The subspecies is endemic to approximately 12-14 sites at the Cameroon-Nigeria border, and is critically endangered. To understand survival prospects of the CRG at Mawambi Hills, Cameroon, a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) distribution model was used to predict the distribution of gorillas. Overall, 24% of the study area was predicted to be suitable for gorillas. The most important predictors of gorilla distribution were elevation as a surrogate for accessibility (52.4%), distance to nearby villages which represents proximity to anthropogenic disturbance (22.7%), and slope steepness as a proxy for security (19.4%). Gorillas mainly occupied slopes of steep hills and avoided areas of human disturbance. To evaluate the spatial relationship between gorilla distribution and human activities, the predicted habitat suitability map was overlaid with a kernel density map of human activities. A positive correlation was found between locations of human activity and suitable habitat for gorillas (r = 0.5). This suggests that anthropogenic pressures in previously unused forest areas are increasing as a result of resource depletion at lower altitudes, consequently putting the gorillas at greater risk. Conservation management plans that seek to reduce human encroachment into habitats preferred by gorillas such as steep hills will probably contribute to gorilla survival. Copyright (c) 2013 S.

Facial Orientation and Facial Shape in Extant Great Apes: A Geometric Morphometric Analysis of Covariation,"['Neaux, D', 'Guy, F', 'Gilissen, E', 'Coudyzer, W', 'Vignaud, P', 'Ducrocq, S']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0057026,FEB 18 2013,6,"The organization of the bony face is complex, its morphology being influenced in part by the rest of the cranium. Characterizing the facial morphological variation and craniofacial covariation patterns in extant hominids is fundamental to the understanding of their evolutionary history. Numerous studies on hominid facial shape have proposed hypotheses concerning the relationship between the anterior facial shape, facial block orientation and basicranial flexion. In this study we test these hypotheses in a sample of adult specimens belonging to three extant hominid genera (Homo, Pan and Gorilla). Intraspecific variation and covariation patterns are analyzed using geometric morphometric methods and multivariate statistics, such as partial least squared on three-dimensional landmarks coordinates. Our results indicate significant intraspecific covariation between facial shape, facial block orientation and basicranial flexion. Hominids share similar characteristics in the relationship between anterior facial shape and facial block orientation. Modern humans exhibit a specific pattern in the covariation between anterior facial shape and basicranial flexion. This peculiar feature underscores the role of modern humans' highly-flexed basicranium in the overall integration of the cranium. Furthermore, our results are consistent with the hypothesis of a relationship between the reduction of the value of the cranial base angle and a downward rotation of the facial block in modern humans, and to a lesser extent in chimpanzees."
"Anopheles moucheti and Anopheles vinckei Are Candidate Vectors of Ape Plasmodium Parasites, Including Plasmodium praefalciparum in Gabon","['Paupy, C', 'Makanga, B', 'Ollomo, B', 'Rahola, N', 'Durand, P', 'Magnus, J', 'Willaume, E', 'Renaud, F', 'Fontenille, D', 'Prugnolle, F']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0057294,FEB 20 2013,7,"During the last four years, knowledge about the diversity of Plasmodium species in African great apes has considerably increased. Several new species were described in chimpanzees and gorillas, and some species that were previously considered as strictly of human interest were found to be infecting African apes. The description in gorillas of P. praefalciparum, the closest relative of P. falciparum which is the main malignant agent of human malaria, definitively changed the way we understand the evolution and origin of P. falciparum. This parasite is now considered to have appeared recently, following a cross-species transfer from gorillas to humans. However, the Plasmodium vector mosquito species that have served as bridge between these two host species remain unknown. In order to identify the vectors that ensure ape Plasmodium transmission and evaluate the risk of transfer of these parasites to humans, we carried out a field study in Gabon to capture Anopheles in areas where wild and semi-wild ape populations live. We collected 1070 Anopheles females belonging to 15 species, among which An. carnevalei, An. moucheti and An. marshallii were the most common species. Using mtDNA-based PCR tools, we discovered that An. moucheti, a major human malaria vector in Central Africa, could also ensure the natural transmission of P. praefalciparum among great apes. We also showed that, together with An. vinckei, An. moucheti was infected with P. vivax-like parasites. An. moucheti constitutes, therefore, a major candidate for the transfer of Plasmodium parasites from apes to humans."

Brain macroscopic changes by MRI investigation during aging were observed in humans and dogs but chimpanzees did not display significant changes. This suggestion led to the statement that brain aging is different in various species. Although human brain changes, e. g. beta-amyloid storage, neurofibrillary tangle formation, lipofuscin, are relatively well known, we are still looking for a suitable animal model to study the mechanisms of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this paper presents a comparative analysis of the changes described in the brains of senile dog, horse and gorilla. In addition we present the latest, non-invasive methods that can be applied in the diagnosis of old age in mammals.

The transmembrane domain of HIV-1 Vpu is sufficient to confer anti-tetherin activity to SIVcpz and SIVgor Vpu proteins: cytoplasmic determinants of Vpu function,"['Kluge, SF', 'Sauter, D', 'Vogl, M', 'Peeters, M', 'Li, YY', 'Bibollet-Ruche, F', 'Hahn, BH', 'Kirchhoff, F']",RETROVIROLOGY,10.1186/1742-4690-10-32,MAR 20 2013,5,"Background: The acquisition of effective Vpu-mediated anti-tetherin activity to promote virion release following transmission of SIVcpzPtt from central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) to humans distinguishes pandemic HIV-1 group M strains from non-pandemic group N, O and P viruses and may have been a prerequisite for their global spread. Some functional motifs in the cytoplasmic region of HIV-1 M Vpus proposed to be important for anti-tetherin activity are more frequently found in the Vpu proteins of SIVcpzPtt than in those of SIVcpzPts infecting eastern chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii), that have not been detected in humans, and SIVgor from gorillas, which is closely related to HIV-1 O and P. Thus, SIVcpzPtt strains may require fewer adaptive changes in Vpu than SIVcpzPts or SIVgor strains to counteract human tetherin.

Results: To examine whether SIVcpzPtt may only need changes in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of Vpu to acquire anti-tetherin activity, whereas SIVcpzPts and SIVgor may also require changes in the cytoplasmic region, we analyzed chimeras between the TMD of an HIV-1 M Vpu and the cytoplasmic domains of SIVcpzPtt (n = 2), SIVcpzPts (n = 2) and SIVgor (n = 2) Vpu proteins. Unexpectedly, all of these chimeras were capable of counteracting human tetherin to enhance virion release, irrespective of the presence or absence of the putative adaptor protein binding sites and the DSGxxS beta-TrCP binding motif reported to be critical for effective anti-tetherin activity of M Vpus. It was also surprising that in three of the six chimeras the gain of anti-tetherin function was associated with a loss of the CD4 degradation activity since this function was conserved among all parental HIV-1, SIVcpz and SIVgor Vpu proteins.

Conclusions: Our results show that changes in the TMD of SIVcpzPtt, SIVcpzPts and SIVgor Vpus are sufficient to render them active against human tetherin. Thus, several previously described domains in the extracellular region of Vpu are not absolutely essential for tetherin antagonism but may be required for other Vpu functions."
"Enamel microwear texture properties of IGF 11778 (Oreopithecus bambolii) from the late Miocene of Baccinello, Italy","['Williams, FL', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.4436/JASS.91006,2013,0,"Late Miocene Oreopithecus bambolii has been posited as a folivore from its pronounced molar shearing crests. However, scanning electron microscopy yields conflicting results with one study of Oreopithecus showing folivory and another indicating a coarser diet was consumed. To address this debate, the dietary proclivities of the well-known IGF 11778 Oreopithecus bambolii specimen are reconstructed by comparing the enamel texture properties of this specimen to extant Alouatta palliata (n = 11), Cebus apella (n = 13), Gorilla gorilla (n = 9), Lophocebus albigena (n = 15), Pan troglodytes (n = 17) and Trachypithecus cristatus (n = 12). Dental microwear is captured by scanning facet 9, a Phase II facet on the hypoconid surface, using white-light confocal microscopy at 100x. The scanning was followed by scale-sensitive fractal analysis, yielding four texture characteristics. These were ranked before ANOVA with post-hoc tests of significance and multivariate analyses were conducted. Oreopithecus specimen IGF 11778 does not match any of the extant taxa consistently but in some analyses is associated with Lophocebus, and secondarily with Pan, Gorilla and Cebus outliers suggesting mixed-fruit and hard-object feeding characterized at least a portion of its diet. The partially open habitat of late Miocene Baccinello may have had resources with mechanically resistant foods, or foods found near ground level were consumed. Hard, brittle foods, insects, and or extraneous grit may have contributed to the greater use-wear complexity of the enamel surface observed in IGF 11778 compared to extant folivores. IGF 11778 does not exhibit the degree of anisotropy characterizing Trachypithecus and Alouatta. The partial resemblance of IGF 11778 to some great ape specimens may indicate intermittent extractive and or terrestrial foraging."
Role of the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in seed dispersal in tropical forests and implications of its decline,"['Petre, CA', 'Tagg, N', 'Haurez, B', 'Beudels-Jamar, R', 'Huynen, MC', 'Doucet, JL']",BIOTECHNOLOGIE AGRONOMIE SOCIETE ET ENVIRONNEMENT,NA,2013,6,"Patterns of seed dispersal significantly affect plant demography, dynamics and succession. In the tropics, the majority of tree species bear fruits that are adapted to animal-mediated dispersal. Amongst seed dispersers, the contribution of primates is widely recognized by ecologists as incomparable. However, in lowland Afrotropical forests, the specific role of the largest primate species, the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla Savage and Wyman, 1847), has been overlooked. This is of particular relevance as this species seems to fulfill important criteria for effective dispersal, both quantitatively and qualitatively. One trait makes it potentially unique as seed disperser; the regular deposition of seeds in open canopy environments where light will not be a limiting factor for subsequent seedling growth and survival. The magnitude of which this particular trait contributes to forest dynamics remains unexplored though it could be potentially important. It might no longer be the case, however, as the western lowland gorilla is critically endangered. The loss of the ecological services provided by large-bodied seed dispersers may have considerable impacts on the forests. Through dispersal limitation, population dynamics of plants in forests devoid of large frugivores will be strongly impacted. In the long-term, this may lead to shifts in plant community structure, composition and to reduced tree diversity. Currently, forests of the Congo basin face increasing level of deforestation and degradation, which puts already the ecosystem integrity in jeopardy. The additional threat that represents frugivorous wildlife depletion is therefore of forest management concern."
Teeth and Human Life-History Evolution,"['Smith, TM']","ANNUAL REVIEW OF ANTHROPOLOGY, VOL 42",10.1146/annurev-anthro-092412-155550,2013,8,"Modern humans differ from wild great apes in gestation length, weaning age, interbirth interval, sexual maturity, and longevity, but evolutionary anthropologists do not know when these distinctive life-history conditions evolved. Dental tissues contain faithful records of birth and incremental growth, and scholars suggest that molar eruption age, tooth wear, growth disturbances, tooth chemistry, and/or tooth calcification may provide insight into the evolution of human life history. However, recent comparative approaches and empirical evidence demonstrate that caution is warranted when inferring hominin weaning ages or interbirth intervals from first molar eruption, tooth wear, or growth disturbances. Fine-scaled studies of tooth chemistry provide direct evidence of weaning. Early hominin tooth calcification is more ape-like than human-like, and fully modern patterns appear only after Neanderthals and Homo sapiens diverged, concurrent with changes in cranial and postcranial development. Additional studies are needed to relate these novel calcification patterns to specific changes in life-history variables."

This has important implications for ape conservation management, given that accurate nest builder identification is required to estimate density, crucial in monitoring, and allows inferences about environmental and social factors that may have contributed to the transition from tree to ground sleeping in early hominins. We conducted a 24-month marked nest count survey in La Belgique, Cameroon, and recorded the occurrence of chimpanzee tree and ground night nests, temperature and rainfall, predator and large mammal abundance, human activities, nesting tree species, and Uapaca spp. consumption. Ground night nesting occurred at a rate of 3.47% (n = 1,008), with more in swamps, in the dry season and with increasing human activities. We found no influence of leopard/elephant presence, but a possible influence of lack of nesting trees. We suggest chimpanzees visit swamps in the dry season (low water levels) for relief from hunting pressure and to consume Uapaca spp. fruits. Ground nesting may be enabled due to high abundance of terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, and may be favoured for inconspicuousness and safety from gun hunters. (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel"

Notable sampling gaps exist, including large-bodied hominoids such as gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), orangutans (Pongo spp.) and bonobos (Pan paniscus), for which data have been characterized as high priority. Here, we report the sleep architecture of three female and two male orang-utans housed at the Indianapolis Zoo. Sleep states were identified by scoring correlated behavioural signatures (e.g., respiration, gross body movement, muscle atonia, random eye movement, etc.). The captive orang-utans were focal subjects for a total of 70 nights (1013 h) recorded. We found that orangutans slept an average of 9.11 h (range 5.85-11.2 h) nightly and were characterized by an average NREM of 8.03 h (range 5.47-10.2 h) and REM of 1.11 (range: 0.38-2.2 h) per night. In addition, using a sleeping platform complexity index (SPCI) we found that individuals that manufactured and slept in more complex beds were characterized by higher quality sleep. Sleep fragmentation (the number of brief awakenings greater than 2 mm per hour), arousability (number of motor activity bouts per hour), and total time awake per night were reduced by greater quality sleep environments. Therefore, comfortable sleeping environments reduced arousability and improve sleep quality in captive orang-utans. These results support Fruth & Hohmann's (1996) hypothesis, which purported that the tree-limb-to-sleeping platform transition in Miocene apes improved sleep quality."

Impacts of logging and hunting on western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) populations and consequences for forest regeneration. A review,"['Haurez, B', 'Petre, CA', 'Doucet, JL']",BIOTECHNOLOGIE AGRONOMIE SOCIETE ET ENVIRONNEMENT,NA,2013,4,"Timber exploitation is rapidly expanding throughout the Congo Basin. Forest areas assigned to timber harvesting have sharply expanded over the decades and logging concessions now largely overlap with the range of western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla Savage & Wyman, 1847). However this species, which is considered as critically endangered by IUCN, could play an essential role in maintaining the structure and composition of tropical rainforest notably through seed dispersal services. This is likely due to its frugivorous diet, high stomach capacity and ability to swallow seeds of variable sizes. Moreover gorillas have a long gut retention time of ingested food, travel long daily distances and deposit most ingested seeds in suitable habitats for plant development (such as logging gaps). Consequently, the preservation of the role of gorilla in forest regeneration is essential in the context of logged forest ecosystems. Timber harvesting has two major opposing impacts on gorilla populations: on the one hand, gorillas benefit from growth of herbaceous vegetation (e.g. Marantaceae and Zingiberaceae) following forest canopy opening, as such herbs provide both staple food and nest-building materials; on the other hand, gorilla populations suffer with the rise in hunting associated with logging activity, especially with road network installation. Considering the potential negative knock-on effects of logging concessions on the ecological function of western lowland gorilla, the implementation of timber harvesting methods that preserve gorilla populations is a considerable challenge for forest sustainability, as well as for gorilla's conservation."

We further analyze gesture form and use in relation to the age of the sender with special consideration of the reaction of the receiver to better explain the function of the hand-on. The focus of the study is to compare this gesture across different age groups in gorillas in regard to both production and reception and to get insights into possible origins of the gesture."

In this study, terrestrial and arboreal nest construction among chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) populations was investigated in the Lebialem-Mone Forest Landscape (LMFL), Southwest Region, Cameroon, to examine the anthropogenic effects on nest location. Data on the height, distribution and approximate age of chimpanzee night nests were collected during two 4-week primate field surveys (July to August 2010; July 2011) at two field sites (Bechati and Andu) within the LMFL. Data were collected using the line transect method. Chimpanzee night nests were categorized by their location: arboreal versus terrestrial. During the two field surveys, arboreal night nests were the most frequently constructed nest type at both sites, and the only type of night nest constructed at Bechati. Terrestrial night nests were also constructed at Andu. The main difference between these two sites is the level of human predation and agricultural development. At Bechati chimpanzees inhabit forest regions around dense, expanding villages and are regularly hunted by humans. However, at Andu the chimpanzee populations are not under the same threat. Therefore, terrestrial night nest construction in the LMFL appears to be a behavior exhibited where there is less human presence. Copyright (c) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel"

The number of fecal samples positive for Cryptosporidium was significantly higher during the rainy than during the dry season (p<0.005). The results showed that feces collected in the rainy season were almost three times more likely to be positive for Cryptosporidium than those collected in the dry season (OR=2.81). Cryptosporidium detection was significantly negatively affected by highest temperatures (>28.7 degrees C, p<0.001).

We genotyped 26 individuals from the North American captive gorilla collection at 11 autosomal microsatellite loci in order to compare levels of genetic diversity to wild populations, investigate genetic signatures of a population bottleneck and identify the genetic structure of the captive-born population. Captive gorillas had significantly higher levels of allelic diversity (t7=4.49, P=0.002) and heterozygosity (t7=4.15, P=0.004) than comparative wild populations, yet the population has lost significant allelic diversity while in captivity when compared to founders (t7=2.44, P=0.04). Analyses suggested no genetic evidence for a population bottleneck of the captive population. Genetic structure results supported the management of North American captive gorillas as a single population. Our results highlight the utility of genetic management approaches for endangered nonhuman primate species."
Repeated innovation in great apes,"['Manrique, HM', 'Volter, CJ', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.10.026,JAN 2013,9,"Innovation has been defined as a solution to a novel problem or a novel solution to an old problem. The second part of this definition requires the inhibition of previously learnt solution strategies before a novel solution can be found. Therefore, inventing novel solutions for an old problem is considered to be particularly difficult. We investigated the ability of great apes to produce multiple new solutions to a task after each of those solutions became obsolete. We presented all four nonhuman great ape species with a task consisting of extracting a food reward from a puzzle box. Initially, the task could be solved in three different ways that varied in difficulty. After subjects discovered the first solution, we allowed them to use it for some trials and then it became obsolete. If the apes could overcome their initial response and find the next solution, we again allowed them to use it for some time and once again it became obsolete. The final step consisted of finding the third solution to secure the food reward. We found that all species except orang-utans, Pongo abelii, were able to solve all versions of the problem. Furthermore, they overcame the obsolete techniques quickly and efficiently, indicating high degrees of behavioural flexibility and inhibitory control. In contrast to previous research on social learning, our results suggest that great apes are not conservative and adjust their behaviour flexibly when the physical constraints of a task change.

Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) quantify split solid objects,"['Cacchione, T', 'Hrubesch, C', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-012-0545-3,JAN 2013,4,"Recent research suggests that gorillas' and orangutans' object representations survive cohesion violations (e.g., a split of a solid object into two halves), but that their processing of quantities may be affected by them. We assessed chimpanzees' (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos' (Pan paniscus) reactions to various fission events in the same series of action tasks modelled after infant studies previously run on gorillas and orangutans (Cacchione and Call in Cognition 116:193-203, 2010b). Results showed that all four non-human great ape species managed to quantify split objects but that their performance varied as a function of the non-cohesiveness produced in the splitting event. Spatial ambiguity and shape invariance had the greatest impact on apes' ability to represent and quantify objects. Further, we observed species differences with gorillas performing lower than other species. Finally, we detected a substantial age effect, with ape infants below 6 years of age being outperformed by both juvenile/adolescent and adult apes."
Marked Population Structure and Recent Migration in the Critically Endangered Sumatran Orangutan (Pongo abelii),"['Nater, A', 'Arora, N', 'Greminger, MP', 'van Schaik, CP', 'Singleton, I', 'Wich, SA', 'Fredriksson, G', 'Perwitasari-Farajallah, D', 'Pamungkas, J', 'Krutzen, M']",JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,10.1093/jhered/ess065,JAN-FEB 2013,8,"A multitude of factors influence how natural populations are genetically structured, including dispersal barriers, inhomogeneous habitats, and social organization. Such population subdivision is of special concern in endangered species, as it may lead to reduced adaptive potential and inbreeding in local subpopulations, thus increasing the risk of future extinctions. With only 6600 animals left in the wild, Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) are among the most endangered, but also most enigmatic, great ape species. In order to infer the fine-scale population structure and connectivity of Sumatran orangutans, we analyzed the most comprehensive set of samples to date, including mitochondrial hyper-variable region I haplotypes for 123 individuals and genotypes of 27 autosomal microsatellite markers for 109 individuals. For both mitochondrial and autosomal markers, we found a pronounced population structure, caused by major rivers, mountain ridges, and the Toba caldera. We found that genetic diversity and corresponding long-term effective population size estimates vary strongly among sampling regions for mitochondrial DNA, but show remarkable similarity for autosomal markers, hinting at male-driven long-distance gene flow. In support of this, we identified several individuals that were most likely sired by males originating from other genetic clusters. Our results highlight the effect of natural barriers in shaping the genetic structure of great ape populations, but also point toward important dispersal corridors on northern Sumatra that allow for genetic exchange."
"Impact of human activities on Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli habitats in the Mawambi Hills, southwest Cameroon","['Etiendem, DN', 'Tagg, N', 'Hens, L', 'Pereboom, Z']",ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH,10.3354/esr00492,2013,1,"Most forest habitats in Cameroon support villages whose inhabitants are heavily reliant on the forests for their everyday needs. We assessed the socio-economic status and natural resource use of 3 villages bordering Mawambi Hills, an unprotected forest in southwest Cameroon, home to both the Critically Endangered Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli and the Endangered Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee Pan troglodytes ellioti. This forest likely hosts one of the largest sub-populations of Cross River gorillas in Cameroon and is vulnerable to human influence given that it lies in close proximity to surrounding villages and is less hilly than other Cross River gorilla habitats. We show that employment opportunities in surrounding villages are rare, and people rely on agriculture and the collection of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), such as eru Gnetum spp. and bush mango Irvingia spp., for food and income. We also show that areas of heavy human activity coincide spatially with great ape nest sites and raise concerns about the potential impact of human activities on great ape survival at the site. We call for (1) sustainable harvesting and marketing of NTFPs, (2) the introduction of alternative livelihood opportunities (e. g. beekeeping and on-farm production of NTFPs), (3) active wildlife law enforcement to safeguard the persistence of great apes, and (4) the introduction of a community-based forest management programme that will enable communities to secure the rights to use and manage surrounding forest resources legally."
Detecting intraannual dietary variability in wild mountain gorillas by stable isotope analysis of feces,"['Blumenthal, SA', 'Chritz, KL', 'Rothman, JM', 'Cerling, TE']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1215782109,DEC 26 2012,9,"We use stable isotope ratios in feces of wild mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) to test the hypothesis that diet shifts within a single year, as measured by dry mass intake, can be recovered. Isotopic separation of staple foods indicates that intraannual changes in the isotopic composition of feces reflect shifts in diet. Fruits are isotopically distinct compared with other staple foods, and peaks in fecal delta C-13 values are interpreted as periods of increased fruit feeding. Bayesian mixing model results demonstrate that, although the timing of these diet shifts match observational data, the modeled increase in proportional fruit feeding does not capture the full shift. Variation in the isotopic and nutritional composition of gorilla foods is largely independent, highlighting the difficulty for estimating nutritional intake with stable isotopes. Our results demonstrate the potential value of fecal sampling for quantifying short-term, intraindividual dietary variability in primates and other animals with high temporal resolution even when the diet is composed of C-3 plants."
A Modular Mind? A Test Using Individual Data from Seven Primate Species,"['Amici, F', 'Barney, B', 'Johnson, VE', 'Call, J', 'Aureli, F']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0051918,DEC 19 2012,10,"It has long been debated whether the mind consists of specialized and independently evolving modules, or whether and to what extent a general factor accounts for the variance in performance across different cognitive domains. In this study, we used a hierarchical Bayesian model to re-analyse individual level data collected on seven primate species (chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, gorillas, spider monkeys, brown capuchin monkeys and long-tailed macaques) across 17 tasks within four domains (inhibition, memory, transposition and support). Our modelling approach evidenced the existence of both a domain-specific factor and a species factor, each accounting for the same amount (17%) of the observed variance. In contrast, inter-individual differences played a minimal role. These results support the hypothesis that the mind of primates is (at least partially) modular, with domain-specific cognitive skills undergoing different evolutionary pressures in different species in response to specific ecological and social demands."
Does Bipedality Predict the Group-Level Manual Laterality in Mammals?,"['Giljov, A', 'Karenina, K', 'Malashichev, Y']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0051583,DEC 12 2012,4,"Background: Factors determining patterns of laterality manifestation in mammals remain unclear. In primates, the upright posture favours the expression of manual laterality across species, but may have little influence within a species. Whether the bipedalism acts the same in non-primate mammals is unknown. Our recent findings in bipedal and quadrupedal marsupials suggested that differences in laterality pattern, as well as emergence of manual specialization in evolution might depend on species-specific body posture. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that the postural characteristics are the key variable shaping the manual laterality expression across mammalian species.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied forelimb preferences in a most bipedal marsupial, brush-tailed bettong, Bettongia penicillata in four different types of unimanual behavior. The significant left-forelimb preference at the group level was found in all behaviours studied. In unimanual feeding on non-living food, catching live prey and nest-material collecting, all or most subjects were lateralized, and among lateralized bettongs a significant majority displayed left-forelimb bias. Only in unimanual supporting of the body in the tripedal stance the distribution of lateralized and non-lateralized individuals did not differ from chance. Individual preferences were consistent across all types of behaviour. The direction or the strength of forelimb preferences were not affected by the animals' sex.

Conclusions/Significance: Our findings support the hypothesis that the expression of manual laterality depends on the species-typical postural habit. The interspecies comparison illustrates that in marsupials the increase of bipedality corresponds with the increase of the degree of group-level forelimb preference in a species. Thus, bipedalism can predict pronounced manual laterality at both intra-and interspecific levels in mammals. We also conclude that quadrupedal position in biped species can slightly hinder the expression of manual laterality, but the evoked biped position in quadrupedal species does not necessarily lead to the enhanced manifestation of manual laterality."
Dental Evidence for the Reconstruction of Diet in African Early Homo,"['Ungar, PS', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFRICANUS']",CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1086/666700,DEC 2012,10,"The reconstruction of diet is important for understanding the paleoecology and evolution of early hominins. This paper reviews and colligates the fossil evidence for diets of early Homo (Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis, Homo erectus), particularly that related to tooth size, shape, structure, and wear. Technological innovations and new finds have led to improved understandings of feeding adaptations and food preferences in the earliest members of our genus. Differences in dental topography between these species and the australopiths, for example, have been documented, as have differences in microwear textures between H. habilis and H. erectus. These and other lines of evidence suggest a probable shift in diet in early Homo, and especially H. erectus, compared with their australopith forebears, with a broadened subsistence base to include foods with a wider range of fracture properties. Studies to date also make clear that while much remains to be done, early hominin teeth hold the potential to provide more detail about diet and confidence in our reconstructions as samples increase, our understanding of functional morphology improves, and other methods of analysis are applied to the fossils we have."
COMPARISON OF LARYNGEAL MASK AIRWAY USE WITH ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION DURING ANESTHESIA OF WESTERN LOWLAND GORILLAS (GORILLA GORILLA GORILLA),"['Cerveny, SN', ""D'Agostino, JJ"", 'Davis, MR', 'Payton, ME']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,DEC 2012,1,"The laryngeal mask airway is an alternative to endotracheal intubation that achieves control of the airway by creating a seal around the larynx with an inflatable cuff. This study compared use of the laryngeal mask airway with endotracheal intubation in anesthetized western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Eight adult gorillas were immobilized for routine and diagnostic purposes for a total of nine anesthetic events. During each anesthetic event, gorillas were either intubated (n = 4; group A) or fitted with a laryngeal mask airway (n = 5; group B). Time required to place each airway device, physiologic parameters, and arterial blood gas were measured and compared between the two groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups for time required to place airway device, heart rate, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, or arterial pH between the two groups. Mean arterial partial pressure of oxygen was significantly greater in group B, 15 (group A: 94 +/- 44 mm Hg; group B: 408 +/- 36 mm Hg; P = 0.0025) and 45 (group A: 104 +/- 21 mm Hg; group B: 407 +/- 77 mm Hg; P = 0.0026) min after airway device placement. Mean respiratory rate was significantly greater in group A at multiple time points. Mean arterial pressure (group A: 129 +/- 16 mm Hg; group B: 60 +/- 8 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (group A: 115 +/- 21 mm Hg; group B: 36 +/- 10 mm Hg) were significantly greater in group A at the time of airway device placement. The laryngeal mask airway maintained oxygenation and ventilation effectively in all gorillas and is a useful alternative to endotracheal intubation in western lowland gorillas."
Human-Recognizable Robotic Gestures,"['Cabibihan, JJ', 'So, WC', 'Pramanik, S']",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTONOMOUS MENTAL DEVELOPMENT,10.1109/TAMD.2012.2208962,DEC 2012,8,"For robots to be accommodated in human spaces and in daily human activities, robots should be able to understand messages from their human conversation partner. In the same light, humans must also understand the messages that are being communicated to them by robots, including nonverbal messages. We conducted a Web-based video study wherein participants interpreted the iconic gestures and emblems produced by an anthropomorphic robot. Out of the 15 robotic gestures presented, we found 6 that can be accurately recognized by the human observer. These were nodding, clapping, hugging, expressing anger, walking, and flying. We review these gestures for their meaning from literature on human and animal behavior. We conclude by discussing the possible implications of these gestures for the design of social robots that are able to have engaging interactions with humans."
Social tolerance and adult play in macaque societies: a comparison with different human cultures,"['Ciani, F', ""Dall'Olio, S"", 'Stanyon, R', 'Palagi, E']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.09.002,DEC 2012,10,"Differences in play behaviour often illuminate complex ecological parameters and social differences. In primate societies, including humans, individuals acquire information through play. It is adults in every community that are most committed to managing social practices. In tolerant species, adults often participate in play to reinforce social networks and cooperation. The 20 macaque species are all organized in multimale, multifemale groups but vary along a continuum from despotic/intolerant to egalitarian/tolerant social systems. These different social styles influence a wide range of behaviours including aggression and affiliation patterns, dominance relationships, and nepotism. We tested some hypotheses by comparing play patterns in two macaque societies at opposite ends of the continuum: despotic Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, and tolerant Tonkean macaques, Macaca tonkeana. Our results show that these two species have striking differences in the distribution of social play according to the age and sex of the players. Our findings strongly indicate that play, a highly plastic and versatile behaviour, is sensitive to the quality of interindividual relationships of a species, thus reflecting the nature of its social network. The different patterns of macaque play show striking parallels with those from comparisons of different human cultures including the distribution of social play according to the age and gender, partner preference according to age, and permissiveness of mothers. The adult play propensity of Tonkean compared to Japanese macaques indicates that adult-adult play is a good predictor for the polarity of changes in aggressiveness between different groups separated either genetically (taxa) or culturally (ethnies).

"Evolutionary Relationships Among Robust and Gracile Australopiths: An ""Evo-devo"" Perspective","['Gunz, P']",EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1007/s11692-012-9185-4,DEC 2012,5,"Hominin fossils of gracile and robust australopith groups were found both in East and in South Africa. It is unclear, however, whether all robusts belong to a monophyletic Paranthropus clade, as the craniofacial resemblance among robust australopiths might only be a superficial correlate of similar masticatory adaptations and not evidence of shared ancestry. It has been suggested that the East African Australopithecus/Paranthropus boisei and the South African A./P. robustus might be convergent allometric variants of their gracile geographical neighbors A. afarensis and A. africanus. Here we approach the phylogenetic questions about robust and gracile australopiths from an ""evo-devo"" perspective, examining how simple alterations of development could contribute to the shape differences among hominin species. Using geometric morphometrics we compare gracile and robust australopith crania in the context of the allometric scaling patterns of Pan troglodytes, P. paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla. We examine support for two alternative evolutionary scenarios based on predictions derived from quantitative genetics models: either (1) A./P. robustus evolved in South Africa from the gracile A. africanus, or (2) A./P. robustus is a local variant of the eastern African A./P. boisei. We use developmental simulations to demonstrate that some robust characteristics (wide faces, anteriorly placed zygomatics, and facial dishing) can be predicted by allometric scaling along the ontogenetic trajectory of the gracile A. africanus. We find, however, that the facial differences between A. africanus specimens (Taung, Sts 5, Sts 71, and Stw 505) and A./P. robustus specimen SK 48 cannot be explained by allometric scaling alone. Facial shape differences between A./P. robustus SK 48 and A./P. boisei (KNM-ER 732, KNM-ER 406, OH 5) and the A./P. aethiopicus specimen KNM-WT 17000, on the other hand, can largely be explained by allometric scaling. This is consistent with a close evolutionary relationship of these robust taxa."
Genetic Characterization of Simian Foamy Viruses Infecting Humans,"['Rua, R', 'Betsem, E', 'Calattini, S', 'Saib, A', 'Gessain, A']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.01715-12,DEC 2012,9,"Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are retroviruses that are widespread among nonhuman primates (NHPs). SFVs actively replicate in their oral cavity and can be transmitted to humans after NHP bites, giving rise to a persistent infection even decades after primary infection. Very few data on the genetic structure of such SFVs found in humans are available. In the framework of ongoing studies searching for SFV-infected humans in south Cameroon rainforest villages, we studied 38 SFV-infected hunters whose times of infection had presumably been determined. By long-term cocultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with BHK-21 cells, we isolated five new SFV strains and obtained complete genomes of SFV strains from chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes; strains BAD327 and AG15), monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans; strain AG16), and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla; strains BAK74 and BAD468). These zoonotic strains share a very high degree of similarity with their NHP counterparts and have a high degree of conservation of the genetic elements important for viral replication. Interestingly, analysis of FV DNA sequences obtained before cultivation revealed variants with deletions in both the U3 region and tas that may correlate with in vivo chronicity in humans. Genomic changes in bet (a premature stop codon) and gag were also observed. To determine if such changes were specific to zoonotic strains, we studied local SFV-infected chimpanzees and found the same genomic changes. Our study reveals that natural polymorphism of SFV strains does exist at both the intersubspecies level (gag, bet) and the intrasubspecies (U3, tas) levels but does not seem to reflect a viral adaptation specific to zoonotic SFV strains."

Here, we report that centromeres or their vicinities in this gibbon species contain tandem repeat sequences that consist of 35-50-bp repeat units, and exhibit a sequence similarity with the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) region of the SVA, LAVA and PVA transposons. SVA is a composite retrotransposon thought to have been formed by fusion of three solo elements in the common ancestor of hominoids. LAVA and PVA are recently identified retrotransposons that have the same basic structure as SVA. Thus, the large-scale tandem repeats in the centromere region may have been derived from one or more of SVA-type transposons, including the three mentioned above and other yet unknown elements, or the repeat sequences could have served as a source for such elements. Amplification of VNTR-related sequences in another gibbon species, Hoolock leuconedys (eastern hoolock gibbon), has recently been reported, but it is yet to be examined whether the large-scale tandem repeats observed in the two species originated from a single event that occurred in their common ancestor. The repeat sequences in the western hoolock gibbon are mostly 40 kb or more in length, are present in 28 of the 38 chromosomes of the somatic cells, and are homozygous for chromosomal presence/absence.

Ectocranial suture fusion in primates: as related to cranial volume and dental eruption,"['Cray, J', 'Cooper, GM', 'Mooney, MP', 'Siegel, MI']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1111/jmp.12018,DEC 2012,6,"Background Timing of calvarial suture fusion is important in primate ontogeny. Ages at death are difficult to assess especially for museum collections. Methods 1550 skulls of Hominoid, Hylobatidae, Macaca and Papio were observed for fusion. Calvarial expansion (early) and dental eruption (late) were utilized as indicators of ontogeny. Homogeneity of slopes and ANOVA were used to determine differences in timing of fusion. Results For calvarial growth the great apes all showed small levels of calvarial suture remodeling prior to full calvarial expansion. For dental eruption, Homo and Macaca share a common pattern of fusion in late adulthood. The other species show early remodeling. Papio was observed to have distinct patterns for suture fusion progression. Conclusions Thus, suture fusion progression although influenced by evolutionary changes in the robusticity of the craniofacial skeleton can be modeled by the phylogeny among this group. Overall, Homo appears to have a distinct pattern of delayed suture fusion progression."
Novel polyomaviruses in South American bats and their relationship to other members of the family Polyomaviridae,"['Fagrouch, Z', 'Sarwari, R', 'Lavergne, A', 'Delaval, M', 'de Thoisy, B', 'Lacoste, V', 'Verschoor, EJ']",JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY,10.1099/vir.0.044149-0,DEC 2012,16,"Bats are the natural reservoir of a variety of viruses, including a polyomavirus (PyV) from a North American brown bat.

Phylogenetic analysis was performed on the genomes of eight representative PyVs, and showed that the bat PyVs form three distinct lineages within the genus Orthopolyomavirus and are genetically different from the previously described North American bat virus. Interestingly, two lineages cluster with PyVs found in chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas. In addition, one group of bat PyVs is genetically related to the human Merkel cell polyomavirus."

Although it has been proposed that this is the result of convergent evolution, little is known about whether this is limited to behavior or also includes the underlying cognitive mechanisms. We compared several species of apes (bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans) and corvids (carrion crows and common ravens) using exactly the same paradigm: a support task with elements from the classical patterned-string tasks. Corvids proved able to solve at least an easy pattern, whereas apes outperformed corvids with respect to the complexity of the patterns solved, the relative number of subjects solving each problem, and the speed to reach criterion. We addressed the question of whether subjects based their choices purely on perceptual cues or on a more abstract understanding of the problem. This was done by using a perceptually very similar but causally different condition where instead of paper strips there were strip shapes painted on a platform. Corvids' performance did not differ between conditions, whereas apes were able to solve the real but not the painted task. This shows that apes were not basing their choices just on spatial or arbitrary perceptual cues. Instead, and unlike corvids, they must have had some causal knowledge of the task."
Spatial Memory in Captive American Black Bears (Ursus americanus),"['Zamisch, V', 'Vonk, J']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0028081,NOV 2012,2,"The spatial memory and foraging strategies of four adult captive-born American black bears (Ursus americanus) were explored in four experiments using a simulated foraging task. In the first three experiments, each session consisted of two phases separated by a delay: During the exploration phase, subjects foraged among a set of baited and unbaited sites. During the delay, the same locations were rebaited and subjects were released again and allowed to search the sites (search phase). In Experiments 1a and 1b, different sites were baited each day and the interval between exploration and search was short (4 hr or 15 min). Subjects were not accurate at recovering the food items in either experiment. In Experiment 2, an ""informed forager"" paradigm was used in which one subject was given privileged knowledge about the location of the food during the exploration phase and was later released with an ""uninformed"" competitor during the search phase. The bears did not achieve above-chance recovery accuracy even in the presence of a competitor. In Experiment 3, the same two of four sites were continually baited and the bears were released simultaneously over a period of 20 days, with each baiting separated by 2 or 3 days. As a group, the bears' foraging accuracy with repeated baiting and longer intervals approached greater than chance accuracy. Results suggest some limitations on bears' use of spatial memory in captive environments, but reveal the potential for use of spatial memory over longer delays."

How are humans and closely related species such as great apes similar and different in their viewing patterns for faces and eyes? Following previous studies comparing chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with humans (Homo sapiens), this study used the eye-tracking method to directly compare the patterns of face and eye scanning by humans, gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), and orangutans (Pongo abelii). Human and ape participants freely viewed pictures of whole bodies and full faces of conspecifics and allospecifics under the same experimental conditions. All species were strikingly similar in that they viewed predominantly faces and eyes. No particular difference was identified between gorillas and orangutans, and they also did not differ from the chimpanzees tested in previous studies. However, humans were somewhat different from apes, especially with respect to prolonged eye viewing. We also examined how species-specific facial morphologies, such as the male flange of orangutans and the black white contrast of human eyes, affected viewing patterns. Whereas the male flange of orangutans affected viewing patterns, the color contrast of human eyes did not Humans showed prolonged eye viewing independently of the eye color of presented faces, indicating that this pattern is internally driven rather than stimulus dependent Overall, the results show general similarities among the species and also identify unique eye-viewing patterns in humans."
Non-invasive monitoring of physiological stress in the Western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla): Validation of a fecal glucocorticoid assay and methods for practical application in the field,"['Shutt, K', 'Setchell, JM', 'Heistermann, M', 'PROPITHECUS-VERREAUXI']",GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY,10.1016/j.ygcen.2012.08.008,NOV 1 2012,19,"Enzymeimmunoassays (EIAs) allow researchers to monitor stress hormone output via measurement of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGCMs) in many vertebrates. They can be powerful tools which allow the acquisition of otherwise unobtainable physiological information from both captive animals and wild animals in remote forest habitats, such as great apes. However, methods for hormone measurement, extraction and preservation need to be adapted and validated for field settings. In preparation for a field study of Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in the Central African Republic we used samples from captive gorillas collected around opportunistic stressful situations to test whether four different glucocorticoid EIAs reflected adrenocortical activity reliably and to establish the lag-time from the stressor to peak excretion. We also validated a field extraction technique and established a simple, non-freezer-reliant method to preserve FGCMs in extracts long-term. We determined the rate of FGCM change over 28 days when samples cannot be extracted immediately and over 12 h when feces cannot be preserved immediately in alcohol. Finally, we used repeat samples from identified individuals to test for diurnal variation in FGCM output. Two group-specific assays measuring major cortisol metabolites detected the predicted FGCM response to the stressor reliably, whereas more specific cortisol and corticosterone assays were distinctly less responsive and thus less useful. We detected a lag time of 2-3 days from stressor to peak FGCM excretion. Our field extraction method performed as well as an established laboratory extraction method and FGCMs in dried extracts stored at ambient temperatures were as stable as those at -20 degrees C over 1 yr. Hormones in non-extracted feces in alcohol were stable up to 28 days at ambient temperatures. FGCMs in un-fixed gorilla feces deteriorated to almost 50% of the original values within 6 h under field conditions. We detected no diurnal variation in FGCMs in samples from wild gorillas. Our study highlights the importance of thorough biological and immunological validation of FGCM assays, and presents validated, practical methods for the application of non-invasive adrenocortical monitoring techniques to field conservation contexts where it is crucially needed.

Scheuermann Kyphosis in Nonhuman Primates,"['Farrell, BM', 'Kuo, CC', 'Tang, JA', 'Phan, S', 'Buckley, JM', 'Kondrashov, DG', 'MILWAUKEE-BRACE TREATMENT']",SPINE,10.1097/BRS.0b013e31826f2255,NOV 1 2012,2,"Study Design. A cadaveric survey of the thoracic spines of extant species of nonbipedal primates for the presence of Scheuermann kyphosis.

Objective. To determine the presence and prevalence of Scheuermann kyphosis in quadrupedal species of the closest living relatives to humans to demonstrate that bipedalism is not an absolute requirement for the development of Scheuermann kyphosis.

Summary of Background Data. The etiology of Scheuermann kyphosis remains poorly understood. Biomechanical factors associated with upright posture are thought to play a role in the development of the disorder. To date, Scheuermann kyphosis has been described only in humans and extinct species of bipedal hominids.

Methods. Thoracic vertebrae from 92 specimens of Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee) and 105 specimens of Gorilla gorilla (gorilla) from the Hamann-Todd Osteological Collection at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History were examined for Scheuermann kyphosis on the basis of Sorenson criteria and the presence of anterior vertebral body extensions and for the presence of Schmorl nodes.

Results. Two specimens of P. troglodytes (2.2%) were found to have anatomic features consistent with Scheuermann kyphosis including vertebral body wedging greater than 5 at 3 or more adjacent levels and the presence of anterior vertebral body extensions. One of the affected specimens (50%) demonstrated the presence of Schmorl nodes whereas 2 of the unaffected specimens (2.2%) had Schmorl nodes. None of the specimens of G. gorilla (0%) were found to have anterior vertebral body extensions characteristic of Scheuermann kyphosis or Schmorl nodes.

Conclusion. Thoracic kyphotic deformity consistent with Scheuermann kyphosis exists in quadrupedal nonhuman primates. Bipedalism is not a strict requirement for the development of Scheuermann kyphosis, and the evolutionary origins of the disease predate the vertebral adaptations of bipedal locomotion."
"Quantifying lateral femoral condyle ellipticalness in chimpanzees, gorillas, and humans","['Sylvester, AD', 'Pfisterer, T', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22144,NOV 2012,1,"Articular surfaces of limb bones provide information for understanding animal locomotion because their size and shape are a reflection of habitual postures and movements. Here we present a novel method for quantifying the ellipticalness (i.e., departure from perfectly circular) of the lateral femoral condyle (LFC), applying this technique to hominid femora. Three-dimensional surface models were created for 49 Homo sapiens, 34 Pan troglodytes and 25 Gorilla gorilla femora. Software was developed that fit separate cylinders to each of the femoral condyles. These cylinders were constrained to have a single axis, but could have different radii. The cylinder fit to the LFC was allowed to assume an elliptical cross-section, while the cylinder fit to the medial condyle was constrained to remain circular. The shape of the elliptical cylinder (ratio of the major and minor axes of the ellipse) was recorded, and the orientation of the elliptical cylinder quantified as angles between the major axis of the ellipse and the anatomical and mechanical axes of the femur. Species were compared using analysis of variance and post hoc multiple comparisons tests. Confirming qualitative descriptions, human LFCs are more elliptical than those of chimpanzees and gorillas. Human femora exhibit a narrow range for the angle between the major axis of the elliptical cylinder and femoral axes. Conversely, the chimpanzee sample is bimodal for these angles, exhibiting two ellipse orientations, while Gorilla shows no preferred angle. Our results suggest that like modern human femora, chimpanzee femoral condyles have preferentially used regions. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Target animacy influences chimpanzee handedness,"['Forrester, GS', 'Quaresmini, C', 'Leavens, DA', 'Spiezio, C', 'Vallortigara, G']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-012-0536-4,NOV 2012,20,"We employed a bottom-up, quantitative method to investigate great ape handedness. Our previous investigation of gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) demonstrated that contextual information influenced an individual's handedness toward target objects. Specifically, we found a significant right-hand bias for unimanual actions directed toward inanimate target objects but not for actions directed to animate target objects (Forrester et al. in Anim Cogn 14(6):903-907, 2011). Using the identical methodological technique, we investigated the spontaneous hand actions of nine captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) during naturalistic, spontaneous behavior. We assessed both the frequencies and proportions of lateralized hand actions directed toward animate and inanimate targets employing focal follow video sampling. Like the gorillas, the chimpanzees demonstrated a right-handed bias for actions directed toward inanimate targets, but not toward animate targets. This pattern was evident at the group level and for the majority of subjects at the individual level. We postulate that a right-hand bias for only inanimate targets reflects the left hemisphere's dominant neural processing capabilities for objects that have functional properties (inanimate objects). We further speculate that a population-level right-hand bias is not a human-unique characteristic, but one that was inherited from a common human-ape ancestor."
African Plasmodium vivax: Distribution and origins,"['Culleton, R', 'Carter, R']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/j.ijpara.2012.08.005,NOV 2012,8,"There is increasing evidence that the malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax, is endemic in west and central Africa, a region from which it was previously thought to be almost completely absent due to the very high prevalence of the Duffy negative phenotype in the local human populations. Furthermore, P. vivax, or very closely related parasites, has been identified in both chimpanzees and gorillas from this region. In this review, we discuss the implications of these findings for the current understanding of the origins of P. vivax as a human parasite. With the support of new evidence from mitochondrial genome sequencing, we propose that the evidence is consistent with current, extant P. vivax populations having their origins in Africa.

3D geometric morphometric analysis of the proximal epiphysis of the hominoid humerus,"['Arias-Martorell, J', 'Potau, JM', 'Bello-Hellegouarch, G', 'Pastor, JF', 'Perez-Perez, A', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2012.01560.x,NOV 2012,8,"In this study we perform a three-dimensional geometric morphometric (3D GM) analysis of the proximal epiphysis of the humerus in extant great apes, including humans, in order to accurately describe the functional anatomical differences between these taxa. In addition, a fossil hominin specimen of Australopithecus afarensis was included in a multivariate GM analysis in order to test the potential of this methodological approach for making locomotor inferences from fossil remains. The results obtained show significant differences in proximal humeral morphology among the taxa studied, which had thus far largely remained unnoticed. Based on morphofunctional considerations, these anatomical differences can be correlated to differences in the locomotor repertoires of the taxa, thus confirming that the proximal humerus is suitable for constructing paleobiological inferences about locomotion. Modern humans display markedly divergent features, which set them apart from both the extant great apes and the fossil hominin A. afarensis. The morphology of the proximal epiphysis of the humerus of the latter more closely resembles that of the orangutans, thus suggesting that despite hindlimb adaptations to bipedalism, the forelimb of this taxon was still functionally involved in arboreal behaviors, such as climbing or suspension."
Brown Lemurs (Eulemur fulvus) Can Master the Qualitative Version of the Reverse-Reward Contingency,"['Glady, Y', 'Genty, E', 'Roeder, JJ']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0048378,OCT 31 2012,2,Behavioral flexibility that requires behavioral inhibition has important fitness consequences. One task commonly used to assess behavioral inhibition is the reverse-reward task in which the subject is rewarded by the non selected items. Lemurs were tested for their ability to solve the qualitative version of the reverse-reward task with the choice between identical quantities of different food items instead of different quantities of the same food. Two of four subjects mastered the task without a correction procedure and were able to generalize the acquired rule to novel combinations of food. One of the two subjects competent on the quality version of the task could transfer this ability to different quantities of the same food. Our results are compared to lemurs' performances when tested under the quantitative version in a previous study and those of capuchin monkeys tested under a similar paradigm. The whole results suggest that the qualitative version of the reverse-reward task may be easier to master than its quantitative counterpart and that lemurs perform better than capuchin monkeys as they were able to later transfer the learning rule to the quantitative version of the task.
Are there geniuses among the apes?,"['Herrmann, E', 'Call, J']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2012.0191,OCT 5 2012,18,"We are often asked whether some apes are smarter than others. Here we used two individual-based datasets on cognitive abilities to answer this question and to elucidate the structure of individual differences. We identified some individuals who consistently scored well across multiple tasks, and even one individual who could be classified as exceptional when compared with her conspecifics. However, we found no general intelligence factor. Instead, we detected some clusters of certain abilities, including inferences, learning and perhaps a tool-use and quantities cluster. Thus, apes in general and chimpanzees in particular present a pattern characterized by the existence of some smart animals but no evidence of a general intelligence factor. This conclusion contrasts with previous studies that have found evidence of a g factor in primates. However, those studies have used group-based as opposed to the individual-based data used here, which means that the two sets of analyses are not directly comparable. We advocate an approach based on testing multiple individuals (of multiple species) on multiple tasks that capture cognitive, motivational and temperament factors affecting performance. One of the advantages of this approach is that it may contribute to reconcile the general and domain-specific views on primate intelligence."
Evaluation of different storage methods to characterize the fecal bacterial communities of captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Vlckova, K', 'Mrazek, J', 'Kopecny, J', 'Petrzelkova, KJ']",JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS,10.1016/j.mimet.2012.07.015,OCT 2012,10,"Freezing is considered to be the best method for long-term storage of bacterial DNA from feces; however this method cannot be usually applied for samples of wild primates collected in the challenging conditions of the tropical forest. In order to find an alternative conservation method of fecal samples from wild great apes, we compared freezing with other fixation methods. Fecal samples from 11 captive gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from three Czech Zoos were stored using freezing, RNA Stabilization Reagent (RNAlater), and 96% ethanol. Subsequently, the samples were examined using culture-independent methods (PCR-DGGE, and Real-time PCR) to qualitatively and quantitatively assess fecal microbiota composition and to compare differences among the storage methods. Noticeably, freezing samples resulted in the highest recoveries of DNA. No significant differences in DNA recovery were found between freezing and using RNAlater; however, significantly lower DNA concentrations were recovered from samples stored in 96% ethanol. Using PCR-DGGE we found that either 96% ethanol, RNAlater or freezing were suitable for preserving bacterial DNA; however fingerprints obtained from RNAlater storage were more similar to those obtained from the frozen method; in comparison to the patterns resulting from storing samples in ethanol. Using qPCR, frozen samples yielded the highest values of bacterial counts, with the exception of Enterobacteriaceae, which showed the highest numbers using samples stored in ethanol. Sequences of amplicons obtained from PCR-DGGE belonged to the families Clostridiaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae, phylum Firmicutes: however most amplicons showed sequence similarity to previously uncultured microorganisms. Bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes were the most frequently identified species in the fecal bacterial communities of captive western gorillas. The study showed that RNAlater is an optimal storage method when freezing is not possible. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
MAXIMIZING NONHUMAN PRIMATE FECAL SAMPLING IN THE REPUBLIC OF CONGO,"['Olson, SH', 'Cameron, K', 'Reed, P', 'Ondzie, A', 'Joly, D']",JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES,10.7589/2011-11-341,OCT 2012,0,"Techniques for detection of pathogens in wildlife feces allow disease surveillance of species that are difficult to locate and capture (e.g., great apes). However, optimal strategies for detection of feces in logistically challenging environments, such as the forests of Central Africa, have not been developed. We modeled fecal gorilla sampling in the Republic of Congo with computer simulations to explore the performance of different fecal sampling designs in large tropical landscapes. We simulated directed reconnaissance walk (recce) and line-transect distance-sampling survey designs and combinations thereof to maximize the number of fecal samples collected, while also estimating relative ape density on a virtual landscape. We analyzed the performance of different sampling designs across different densities and distributions of ape populations, assessing each for accuracy as well as cost and time efficiencies. Past ape density surveys and fecal deposition rates were used to parameterize the simulated fecal sampling designs. Our results showed that a mixed sampling design that combines traditional transect and a directed reconnaissance sampling design maximized the number of fecal samples collected and estimates of species density. Targeted sampling produced strongly biased estimates of population abundance but maximized efficiency. This research will help design the fecal sampling component of a larger study relating great ape density to Ebola fecal antibody prevalence."

Here, three captive adult American black bears were presented with a series of natural concept discrimination tasks on a touchscreen computer, in which the discriminations varied in degree of abstraction. The more abstract discriminations could not be performed by attending to perceptual features of the stimuli alone. For instance, at the most abstract level, the bears were required to select images of animals rather than nonanimals, and exemplars within both categories were perceptually diverse. At least one bear performed at above-chance levels with transfer to novel images at each level of abstraction. The bear that began testing with the most abstract problems showed the best transfer on more abstract discriminations, suggesting that the usual practice of overtraining animals on perceptual discriminations may hinder their ability to acquire concepts at more abstract levels. The bears' performance suggests that a generalized diet may be more critical than group living with regard to the evolution of complex cognition in carnivores.

The effect of domestication and ontogeny in swine cognition (Sus scrofa scrofa and S. s. domestica),"['Albiach-Serrano, A', 'Brauer, J', 'Cacchione, T', 'Zickert, N', 'Amici, F']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2012.07.005,OCT 2012,13,"Domesticated animals show physical, behavioural and cognitive differences from their closest wild relatives. This may have resulted from the former's long and continued selection by humans throughout history, but in some cases it could just reflect developmental differences between wild and domestic animals, given that their environments usually differ significantly. In order to investigate possible effects of domestication and ontogeny on swine cognition, we tested wild boars and two groups of domestic pigs living in more and less enriched conditions. In an object choice paradigm subjects had to find food hidden in one of two containers. They received either a physical cue (i.e., the slope of the board hiding the food, the presence or absence of noise from a shaken container, the sight of a baited container changing position) or a human social cue (i.e., touching, pointing, gazing). According to the domestication hypothesis, given similar rearing conditions domestic pigs should perform better than wild boars when receiving social cues but worse when receiving physical cues. According to the developmental hypothesis, more experienced swine should perform better than less experienced swine both in the physical and in the social domain. Subjects performed better when provided with cues on which they had received adequate experience from their environment, thus providing support to the developmental hypothesis. We conclude by suggesting that specific experience on particular stimuli rather than general experience on a wider range of stimuli may explain swine ability to solve both social and physical tasks.

"The AL 333-160 fourth metatarsal from Hadar compared to that of humans, great apes, baboons and proboscis monkeys: Non-conclusive evidence for pedal arches or obligate bipedality in Hadar hominins","['Mitchell, PJ', 'Sarmiento, EE', 'Meldrum, DJ', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jchb.2012.08.001,2012,3,"Based on comparisons to non-statistically representative samples of humans and two great ape species (i.e. common chimpanzees Pan troglodytes and lowland gorillas Gorilla gorilla), Ward et al. (2011) concluded that a complete hominin fourth metatarsal (4th MT) from Hadar, AL 333-160, belonged to a committed terrestrial biped with fixed transverse and longitudinal pedal arches, which was no longer under selection favoring substantial arboreal behaviors. According to Ward et al., the Hadar 4th MT had (1) a torsion value indicating a transverse arch, (2) sagittal plane angles between the diaphyseal long axis and the planes of the articular surfaces indicating a longitudinal arch, and (3) a narrow mediolateral to dorsoplantar base ratio, an ectocuneiform facet, and tarsal articular surface contours all indicating a rigid foot without an ape-like mid-tarsal break. Comparisons of the Hadar 4th MT characters to those of statistically representative samples of humans, all five great ape species, baboons and proboscis monkeys show that none of the correlations Ward et al. make to localized foot function were supported by this analysis. The Hadar 4th MT characters are common to catarrhines that have a midtarsal break and lack fixed transverse or longitudinal arches. Further comparison of the AL 333-160 4th MT length, and base, midshaft and head circumferences to those of catarrhines with field collected body weights show that this bone is uniquely short with a large base. Its length suggests the AL 333-160 individual was a poor leaper with limited arboreal behaviors and lacked a longitudinal arch. i.e. its 4th MT long axis was usually held perpendicular to gravity. Its large base implies cuboid-4th MT joint mobility. A relatively short 4th MT head circumference indicates AL 333-160 had small proximal phalanges with a restricted range of mobility. Overall. AL 333-160 is most similar to the 4th MT of eastern gorillas. a slow moving quadruped that sacrifices arboreal behaviors for terrestrial ones. This study highlights evolutionary misconceptions underlying the practice of using localized anatomy and/or a single bony element to reconstruct overall locomotor behaviors and of summarizing great ape structure and behavior based on non-statistically representative samples of only a few living great ape species.

Maximum Likelihood Implementation of an Isolation-with-Migration Model with Three Species for Testing Speciation with Gene Flow,"['Zhu, TQ', 'Yang, ZH']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/mss118,OCT 2012,11,"We implement an isolation with migration model for three species, with migration occurring between two closely related species while an out-group species is used to provide further information concerning gene trees and model parameters. The model is implemented in the likelihood framework for analyzing multilocus genomic sequence alignments, with one sequence sampled from each of the three species. The prior distribution of gene tree topology and branch lengths at every locus is calculated using a Markov chain characterization of the genealogical process of coalescent and migration, which integrates over the histories of migration events analytically. The likelihood function is calculated by integrating over branch lengths in the gene trees (coalescent times) numerically. We analyze the model to study the gene tree-species tree mismatch probability and the time to the most recent common ancestor at a locus. The model is used to construct a likelihood ratio test (LRT) of speciation with gene flow. We conduct computer simulations to evaluate the LRT and found that the test is in general conservative, with the false positive rate well below the significance level. For the test to have substantial power, hundreds of loci are needed. Application of the test to a human-chimpanzee-gorilla genomic data set suggests gene flow around the time of speciation of the human and the chimpanzee."

Here we use an alternative approach to genetic inference of species split times in recent human and ape evolution that is independent of the fossil record. We first use genetic parentage information on a large number of wild chimpanzees and mountain gorillas to directly infer their average generation times. We then compare these generation time estimates with those of humans and apply recent estimates of the human mutation rate per generation to derive estimates of split times of great apes and humans that are independent of fossil calibration. We date the human-chimpanzee split to at least 7-8 million years and the population split between Neanderthals and modern humans to 400,000-800,000 y ago. This suggests that molecular divergence dates may not be in conflict with the attribution of 6- to 7-million-y-old fossils to the human lineage and 400,000-y-old fossils to the Neanderthal lineage."

The hypothesis holds that antagonistic selection for a large neonatal brain and a narrow, bipedal-adapted birth canal poses a problem for childbirth; the hominin ""solution"" is to truncate gestation, resulting in an altricial neonate. This explanation for human altriciality based on pelvic constraints persists despite data linking human life history to that of other species. Here, we present evidence that challenges the importance of pelvic morphology and mechanics in the evolution of human gestation and altriciality. Instead, our analyses suggest that limits to maternal metabolism are the primary constraints on human gestation length and fetal growth. Although pelvic remodeling and encephalization during hominin evolution contributed to the present parturitional difficulty, there is little evidence that pelvic constraints have altered the timing of birth."

Krushinskii to estimate the human capability for revealing rule of discrete translocation of hidden target object. RKT was introduced as an addition to the test for extrapolation of the movement direction of the lure seen only at the initial pathway fragment; this test is close to Piaget's test (stage 6) evaluating the capability for mental representation and location of the moving hidden object. During RKT, the lure, hidden from animals, was placed, near where it was previous time: at the first test presentation-under the 1st cylinder, at the 2nd one-under the 2nd cylinder, etc. The animals were tested once. It was shown that they did not catch the necessary for successful solution rule of the lure translocation, direction and step of its translocation at each presentation. Only some of the animals solved RKT, found the lure 3 and more times in succession with no errors or with one error. Nevertheless, in all groups the number of errors was lower than that in the model situation of random search. Such optimization was a consequence of universal for all groups' strategy of search in the places where the lure was found recently. With the similar number of errors, rats, birds, and monkeys performed the search differently. Rats were looking for lure mainly among the cylinders where they had found it previously, whereas monkeys and birds the first the new cylinders located near the target one, which implies the existence, to the weak extent, of elements of prognosis. For all groups of animals, RKT turned out to be more difficult both of the test for extrapolation and of the Piaget's test."

Additionally, survey respondents reported fruit and sweet foods as the most common triggers of R/R. We also explored rates of R/R in a single group of Bornean orangutans at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. We examined the relationship between R/R and feeding schedule and opportunistically observed rates of R/R with and without the presence of browse and sweet foods. We found evidence that R/R is associated with feeding time and that the presence of browse significantly increased the amount of time that animals spent feeding. There was a trend toward decreased R/R when browse was available. We also observed higher rates of R/R when sweet foods were available and we propose that this may have mitigated some of the beneficial effects of browse. We suggest that future studies look further at nutritional influences on R/R behavior. Zoo Biol. 31:609-620, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

The dietary proclivities of this taxon have implications for reconstructing the paleoecology of the Upper Siwaliks. The dental microwear texture properties of Procynocephalus are compared to those from extant tropical forest primates including Alouatta palliata (n = 11), Cebus apella (n = 13), Gorilla gorilla (n = 9), Lophocebus albigena (n = 15) and Trachypithecus cristatus (n = 12). Dental microwear textures are generated by scanning the surface enamel of Facet 9 using white-light confocal microscopy at 100x. Four variables were extracted from scale-sensitive fractal analysis, and the data were ranked before ANOVA with post-hoc tests of significance and multivariate analyses were performed. Procynocephalus clusters closest to Lophocebus, Cebus and some Gorilla specimens suggesting hard-object feeding characterized a portion of its diet. The dental microwear texture of Procynocephalus supports interpretations of widespread grasslands of the Late Pliocene Kansal Formation (Pinjor zone). The extreme enamel complexity characterizing Procynocephalus may derive from consumption of underground storage organs, or other foods with high grit loads. Foods consumed near ground level carry a heavy load of abrasive minerals possibly contributing to greater enamel surface complexity and textural fill volume."
"Problem solving in great apes (Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and Pongo abelii): the effect of visual feedback","['Volter, CJ', 'Call, J', 'CAUSAL']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-012-0519-5,SEP 2012,10,"What kind of information animals use when solving problems is a controversial topic. Previous research suggests that, in some situations, great apes prefer to use causally relevant cues over arbitrary ones. To further examine to what extent great apes are able to use information about causal relations, we presented three different puzzle box problems to the four nonhuman great ape species. Of primary interest here was a comparison between one group of apes that received visual access to the functional mechanisms of the puzzle boxes and one group that did not. Apes' performance in the first two, less complex puzzle boxes revealed that they are able to solve such problems by means of trial-and-error learning, requiring no information about the causal structure of the problem. However, visual inspection of the functional mechanisms of the puzzle boxes reduced the amount of time needed to solve the problems. In the case of the most complex problem, which required the use of a crank, visual feedback about what happened when the handle of the crank was turned was necessary for the apes to solve the task. Once the solution was acquired, however, visual feedback was no longer required. We conclude that visual feedback about the consequences of their actions helps great apes to solve complex problems. As the crank task matches the basic requirements of vertical string pulling in birds, the present results are discussed in light of recent findings with corvids."
"Preliminary bonobo and chimpanzee nesting by habitat type in the northern Lac Tumba Landscape, Democratic Republic of Congo","['Inogwabini, BI', 'Abokome, M', 'Kamenge, T', 'Mbende, L', 'Mboka, L']",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-2028.2012.01323.x,SEP 2012,3,"Knowing how habitat determines the distribution of great apes is essential for understanding their ecology and conservation requirements. Habitats in the northern Lac Tumba Landscape where this study was conducted are mostly swamp and flooded forests, which types have been overlooked in many great ape surveys. This study describes and discusses patterns of bonobo and chimpanzee nesting sites across these habitat types in the general scope of habitat use by great apes. Considerable efforts were deployed to survey forests of the Ngiri Triangle (186 km), Bomongo-Lubengo (126 km) and Bolombo-Losombo (112 km). Great ape nesting site encounter rates (r) were calculated for Bonobos (r = 0.21 nesting sites km-1; Bolombo-Losombo), chimpanzees (r = 0.11 nesting sites km-1; Ngiri Triangle) and (r = 0.02 nesting sites km-1; Bomongo-Lubengo). Swamps and flooded forests dominated the three zones. Nesting sites were at the highest encounter rates in flooded forests; both great ape species were significantly associated with swampy and flood forests. Human signs did not influence the occurrence of nesting sites in these forests. These results confirm findings from other sites where great apes were observed using swamps; they suggest that future surveys include these types of habitat to avoid under-estimating population sizes."
Infant-Directed Communication in Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla): Do Older Animals Scaffold Communicative Competence in Infants?,"['Luef, EM', 'Liebal, K']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22039,SEP 2012,2,"Infant-directed speech is a linguistic phenomenon in which adults adapt their language when addressing infants in order to provide them with more salient linguistic information and aid them in language acquisition. Adult-directed language differs from infant-directed language in various aspects, including speech acoustics, syntax, and semantics. The existence of a gestural motherese in interaction with infants, demonstrates that not only spoken language but also nonvocal modes of communication can become adapted when infants are recipients. Rhesus macaques are so far the only nonhuman primates where a similar phenomenon to motherese has been discovered: the acoustic spectrum of a particular vocalization of adult females may be altered when the addressees are infants. The present paper describes how gorillas adjust their communicative strategies when directing intentional, nonvocal play signals at infants in the sense of a nonvocal motherese. Animals of ages above infancy use a higher rate of repetitions and sequences of the tactile sensory modality when negotiating play with infants. This indicates that gorillas employ a strategy of infant-specific communication. Am. J. Primatol. 74:841-852, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Barriers and traps: great apes' performance in two functionally equivalent tasks,"['Martin-Ordas, G', 'Jaek, F', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-012-0504-z,SEP 2012,5,"Tool-using tasks that require subjects to overcome the obstacles to get a reward have been a major component of research investigating causal knowledge in primates. Much of the debate in this research has focused on whether subjects simply use certain stimulus features or instead use more functionally relevant information regarding the effect that certain features may have on a moving reward. Here, we presented two obstacle tasks, a trap platform and a barrier platform, to 22 great apes. Although perceptually similar, these two tasks contain two perceptually different but functionally equivalent obstacles: a trap and a barrier. In a pre-exposure phase, subjects either experienced an obstacle task or a task without any obstacle. In the transfer phase, all subjects were presented with an obstacle task, either the trap platform or the barrier platform. Our results show that those subjects who received an obstacle task prior to the second task performed better than those who first received a non-obstacle task. The type of obstacle task that subjects received first did not have any effect on their performance in the transfer phase. We suggest that apes possess some knowledge about the effects that obstacles have on slow-moving unsupported objects."
Noninvasive Follow-Up of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Infection in Wild-Living Nonhabituated Western Lowland Gorillas in Cameroon,"['Etienne, L', 'Locatelli, S', 'Ayouba, A', 'Esteban, A', 'Butel, C', 'Liegeois, F', 'Aghokeng, A', 'Delaporte, E', 'Ngole, EM', 'Peeters, M']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.01186-12,SEP 2012,13,"Simian immunodeficiency viruses infecting western lowland gorillas (SIVgor) are closely related to HIV-1 and are most likely the ancestors of HIV-1 groups 0 and P. At present, limited data are available on genetic diversity, transmission, viral evolution, and pathogenicity of SIVgor in its natural host. Between 2004 and 2011, 961 putative gorilla fecal samples were collected at the Campo Ma'an National Park, Cameroon. Among them, 16% cross-reacted with HIV-1 antibodies, corresponding to at least 34 infected gorillas. Combining host genotyping and field data, we identified four social groups composed of 7 to 15 individuals each, with Sly rates ranging from 13% to 29%. Eleven SIVgor-infected gorillas were sampled multiple times; two most likely seroconverted during the study period, showing that SIVgor continues to spread. Phylogenetic analysis of partial env and pol sequences revealed cocirculation of closely related and divergent strains among gorillas from the same social group, indicating SIVgor transmissions within and between groups. Parental links could be inferred for some gorillas infected with closely related strains, suggesting vertical transmission, but horizontal transmission by sexual or aggressive behavior was also suspected. Intra-host molecular evolution in one gorilla over a 5-year period showed viral adaptations characteristic of escape mutants, i.e., V1V2 loop elongation and an increased number of glycosylation sites. Here we show for the first time the feasibility of noninvasive monitoring of nonhabituated gorillas to study SIVgor infection over time at both the individual and population levels. This approach can also be applied more generally to study other pathogens in wildlife."
Visitor Effects on the Behavior of Captive Western Lowland Gorillas: The Importance of Individual Differences in Examining Welfare,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Jaicks, HF', 'Drayton, LA']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20425,SEP-OCT 2012,6,"Given the conflicting and somewhat limited findings available on the effect of zoo visitors on primate behavior, the primary purpose of this study was to provide additional data on gorillas' response to variations in crowd size and to look at what other factorsboth intrinsic (e.g. personality, sex, and rearing history) and extrinsic (e.g. group)might influence such responses. Subjects included four groups (three mixed-sex and one bachelor) of captive western lowland gorillas living at Zoo Atlanta. Overall activity budgets and rates of social behaviors in high and low crowd conditions were compared. Behaviors suggestive of general welfare did not vary as a function of crowd size alone, although we did observe one significant interaction and several trends. Specifically, two groups spent more time engaged in undesirable behaviors in the high crowd condition, whereas the other two groups showed the opposite response pattern. Additionally, males, but not females, showed a trend toward greater rates of contact aggression in the high crowd condition, although wounding rates did not vary with crowd size. We also found trends towards variation in response to crowd size as a function of individual personality ratings. These results suggest that although the visitor effect may constitute an impediment to optimal animal welfare, this may only apply to some individuals or groups. We emphasize the importance of continuing to explore individual differences and the limitations of a one-size-fits-all approach when describing influences on animal welfare.

"Evaluation of effectiveness, safety and reliability of intramuscular medetomidine-ketamine for captive great apes","['Adami, C', 'Wenker, C', 'Hoby, S', 'Bergadano, A']",VETERINARY RECORD,10.1136/vr.100761,AUG 25 2012,2,"Twenty great apes (six orangutans, eight chimpanzees and six gorillas) were anaesthetised prior to being transported for undergoing diagnostic and interventional procedures. Anaesthesia was induced with a combination of medetomidine and ketamine administered intramuscularly through a dart syringe. The onset of anaesthesia varied among apes: the mean (+/- sd) time from darting to recumbency was 12.13 (+/- 1.9), 18.5 (+/- 8.7) and 22.2 (+/- 9.2) minutes in chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas, respectively. The depth of anaesthesia was sufficient to allow safe removal of the animals from the enclosure, intravenous catheter placement and manipulation; however, the anaesthetic effect was short-acting (20 (+/- 7) minutes in orangutans, 16 (+/- 14) in gorillas, and 10 (+/- 4) minutes in chimpanzees, respectively) and isoflurane administration was necessary in the majority of the apes to prolong the duration of anaesthesia, especially when lengthier procedures were performed. The sedative effect of medetomidine was reversed at the end of each procedure with atipamezole, and recovery was smooth and uneventful for all animals."
Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta) Spontaneously Generalize to Novel Quantities in a Reverse-Reward Contingency Task,"['Kralik, JD']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0026019,AUG 2012,1,"The Abstracting generalities from concrete experience allows the application of acquired knowledge to novel situations, a hallmark of primate cognition. Abstraction may also enable some animals to overcome prepotent biases, by allowing them to treat prepotent stimuli and responses more flexibly. The aim of the current study was to determine whether rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) could generalize successful performance on an executive control task with one training exemplar to novel exemplars. Three monkeys learned a reverse-reward task in which they chose between one and four food items. They had to select the smaller quantity to receive the larger one, and so had to inhibit the prepotent selection of the larger quantity. After they learned the task, a transfer test assessed whether they had learned only about the quantities experienced or whether they could generalize to novel quantities. All three rhesus monkeys spontaneously generalized to novel quantities, showing that this species has the ability to generalize significantly beyond the immediate perceptual experience and use this ability to control lower-level, prepotent responses."
Brief communication: Hand preference for bimanual and unimanual feeding in captive gorillas: Extension in a second colony of apes,"['Lambert, M']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22095,AUG 2012,6,"Right-hand dominance is widely considered to be a uniquely human trait. Whether nonhuman primates exhibit similar population-level hand preferences remains a topic of considerable debate. Despite extensive research focusing on laterality in nonhuman primates, our interpretation of these studies is limited due to methodological issues including the lack of a common measure of hand preference and the use of tasks that may not be reliable indicators of handedness. The use of consistent methods between studies is necessary to enable comparisons within and between species and allow for more general conclusions to be drawn from these results. The present study replicates methods used in recent research reporting population-level right-handedness in captive gorillas (Meguerditchian et al.,2010). Observational data were collected on hand preference for unimanual and bimanual feeding in 14 captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Individual-level preferences were found, primarily for bimanual feeding; however, the data reveal no group-level directional bias (contra Meguerditchian et al.). Like the study by Meguerditchian et al. (2010), though, bimanual feeding revealed significantly stronger hand preferences than unimanual reaching, and age, sex, group membership, or rearing history had no effect on hand preference. Finally, variations in diet and corresponding grip type between studies suggest that hand preferences may vary across bimanual tasks depending on grip morphology. This study aims to contribute to our existing knowledge of primate laterality by increasing the number of individuals investigated using methods that allow for comparisons with similar research.

SK 847 and StW 53 resemble the East African Homo specimens that are the most australopith-like, such as KNM-WT 15000 and KNM-ER 1813. The resemblance between StW 53 and Homo is driven partly by similarities in maxillary size. When distances are scaled. StW 53 aligns with A. africanus, while SK 847 clusters primarily with early Homo. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."
Primate phylogeny: molecular evidence for a pongid clade excluding humans and a prosimian clade containing tarsiers,"['Huang, S']",SCIENCE CHINA-LIFE SCIENCES,10.1007/s11427-012-4350-7,AUG 2012,1,"Unbiased readings of fossils are well known to contradict some of the popular molecular groupings among primates, particularly with regard to great apes and tarsiers. The molecular methodologies today are however flawed as they are based on a mistaken theoretical interpretation of the genetic equidistance phenomenon that originally started the field. An improved molecular method the 'slow clock' was here developed based on the Maximum Genetic Diversity hypothesis, a more complete account of the unified changes in genotypes and phenotypes. The method makes use of only slow evolving sequences and requires no uncertain assumptions or mathematical corrections and hence is able to give definitive results. The findings indicate that humans are genetically more distant to orangutans than African apes are and separated from the pongid clade similar to 17.6 million years ago. Also, tarsiers are genetically closer to lorises than simian primates are. Finally, the fossil times for the radiation of mammals at the K/T boundary and for the Eutheria-Metatheria split in the Early Cretaceous were independently confirmed from molecular dating calibrated using the fossil split times of gorilla-orangutan, mouse-rat, and opossum-kangaroo. Therefore, the re-established primate phylogeny indicates a remarkable unity between molecules and fossils."
"Understanding the nesting spatial behaviour of gorillas in the Kagwene Sanctuary, Cameroon","['Funwi-Gabga, N', 'Mateu, J']",STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,10.1007/s00477-011-0541-1,AUG 2012,4,"We use spatial point pattern methods to analyse gorilla nest site data, and to enhance our understanding of the nesting behaviour of the Gorilla gorilla diehli in the Kagwene Sanctuary, Cameroon. Data were split into different seasons and different gorilla groups to better understand gorilla nesting behaviour at these different scales. Gorilla nest site distribution was found to be inhomogeneous and clustered, as a result of the inhomogeneity in the distribution of the environmental factors (such as elevation, slope, vegetation and aspect), and because of the interaction between nest sites. The proposed models reflected therefore a combination of the effect of environmental factors and interaction between nest sites. Predictions from these models showed that there is less space available for gorilla nest site location in the dry season than in the rainy season. It also showed that the Minor gorilla group has a bigger niche than the Major group, suggesting a nesting disadvantage in the larger size group. We also found that nest site locations of Major gorilla groups attract Minor groups, and vice versa."
"To Beg, or Not to Beg? That Is the Question: Mangabeys Modify Their Production of Requesting Gestures in Response to Human's Attentional States","['Maille, A', 'Engelhart, L', 'Bourjade, M', 'Blois-Heulin, C']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0041197,JUL 18 2012,11,"Background: Although gestural communication is widespread in primates, few studies focused on the cognitive processes underlying gestures produced by monkeys.

Methodology/Principal Findings: The present study asked whether red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus) trained to produce visually based requesting gestures modify their gestural behavior in response to human's attentional states. The experimenter held a food item and displayed five different attentional states that differed on the basis of body, head and gaze orientation; mangabeys had to request food by extending an arm toward the food item (begging gesture). Mangabeys were sensitive, at least to some extent, to the human's attentional state. They reacted to some postural cues of a human recipient: they gestured more and faster when both the body and the head of the experimenter were oriented toward them than when they were oriented away. However, they did not seem to use gaze cues to recognize an attentive human: monkeys begged at similar levels regardless of the experimenter's eyes state.

Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that mangabeys lowered their production of begging gestures when these could not be perceived by the human who had to respond to it. This finding provides important evidence that acquired begging gestures of monkeys might be used intentionally."
Teasing apart the contributions of hard dietary items on 3D dental microtextures in primates,"['Calandra, I', 'Schulz, E', 'Pinnow, M', 'Krohn, S', 'Kaiser, TM']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.05.001,JUL 2012,18,"3D dental microtexture analysis is a powerful tool for reconstructing the diets of extinct primates. This method is based on the comparison of fossils with extant species of known diet. The diets of primates are highly diversified and include fruits, seeds, grass, tree leaves, bark, roots, tubers, and animal resources. Fruits remain the main component in the diets of most primates. We tested whether the proportion of fruit consumed is correlated with dental microtexture. Two methods of microtexture analysis, the scale-sensitive fractal analysis (SSFA) and the Dental Areal Surface Texture Analysis (DASTA; after ISO/FDIS 25178-2), were applied to specimens of eight primate species (Alouatia seniculus, Gorilla gorilla, Lophocebus albigena, Macaca fascicularis, Pan troglodytes, Papio cynocephalus, Pongo abelii, Theropithecus gelada). These species largely differ in the mean annual proportion of fruit (from 0 to 90%) in their diet, as well as in their consumption of other hard items (seeds, bark, and insect cuticles) and of abrasive plants. We find the complexity and heterogeneity of textures (SSFA) to correlate with the proportion of fruits consumed. Textural fill volume (SSFA) indicates the proportion of both fruits and other hard items processed. Furthermore, anisotropy (SSFA) relates to the consumption of abrasive plants like grass and other monocots. ISO parameters valley height, root mean square height, material volume, density of peaks, and closed hill and dale areas (DASTA) describe the functional interaction between food items and enamel facets during mastication. The shallow, plastic deformation of enamel surfaces induced by small hard particles, such as phytoliths or dust, results in flat microtexture relief, whereas the brittle, deep fracture caused by large hard items such as hard seeds creates larger relief.

We found a wounded juvenile female Bornean orangutan on 7 October 2006 in the Danum Valley, Sabah, Malaysia, and observed the individual's behavior for 7 days until her death on 13 October 2006. The 5-6-year-old orangutan, which we had observed since 2004, was wounded in the left brachium, back, and right hand. The individual's behavior changed after injury; the mean nest-nest active time became significantly shorter than before injury (from 12 h 3 min to 9 h 33 min), the mean waking time became significantly later (0552-0629 hours) and the mean bedtime became significantly earlier (from 1747 to 1603 hours). In the activity budget, resting increased significantly from 28.0 to 53.3%. Traveling and feeding decreased significantly from 23.5 to 12.7% and from 45.6 to 32.8%, respectively. The rate of brachiation during traveling and nest making decreased, whereas ground activity increased from 0 to 9%. We observed one vomiting incident and four occurrences of watery diarrhea during the 7 days before the individual died. The results of an autopsy performed by a local veterinarian suggested that the cause of death was septicemia because of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of the severely contaminated wounds. The morphology and distribution of the wounds suggested they had been incurred during an attack by a large animal with fangs and/or claws. This juvenile female became independent of its mother at similar to 4-5 years of age, slightly earlier than average. This individual might have been vulnerable to predatory attack because of her small body size (similar to 5 kg at death) and lack of the mother's protection."
3D Analysis of the Forearm Rotational Efficiency Variation in Humans,"['Ibanez-Gimeno, P', 'Jordana, X', 'Manyosa, J', 'Malgosa, A', 'Galtes, I', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.22483,JUL 2012,6,"Pronosupination is a component of the hominoid orthograde corporal plane that enables primates to execute efficient and sure locomotion in their habitat and is an essential movement for the development of manipulative capacities. We analyze human variability in the rotational efficiency of the pronator teres muscle by applying the biomechanical model created by Galtes et al. (Am J Phys Anthropol 2008; 135:293-300; Am J Phys Anthropol 2009a; 140:589-594) to skeletal remains of a human sample (N = 29) and three nonhuman hominoid specimens (chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan) by means of 3D technology. We aim to examine whether there is a distinctive human pattern of rotational efficiency and determine which structural features of the upper-limb bones have the greatest influence on the determination of rotational efficiency. Our results show that the human pattern differs from efficiencies observed in nonhuman hominoids, which may be interpreted in the light of morphofunctional adaptations. We identify medial epicondylar form as the key structure of the upper-limb bones for the determination of the rotational efficiency of the forearm. Results indicate that the more medially projected epicondyle of nonhuman hominoids relative to humans leads to higher values of maximum rotational efficiency. Moreover, the orientation of the medial epicondyle determines the pronounced differences in the position of the maximum efficiencies in the pronosupination range between humans and the studied nonhuman hominoids. Proximodistal orientation of the medial epicondyle is suggested to be a more appropriate feature for distinguishing between humans and nonhuman hominoids than anteroposterior orientation and, therefore, for inferring behavioral aspects from skeletal remains and fossils of primate upper-limb bones.

An Ancestral miR-1304 Allele Present in Neanderthals Regulates Genes Involved in Enamel Formation and Could Explain Dental Differences with Modern Humans,"['Lopez-Valenzuela, M', 'Ramirez, O', 'Rosas, A', 'Garcia-Vargas, S', 'de la Rasilla, M', 'Lalueza-Fox, C', 'Espinosa-Parrilla, Y']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/mss023,JUL 2012,9,"Genetic changes in regulatory elements are likely to result in phenotypic effects that might explain population-specific as well as species-specific traits. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are posttranscriptional repressors involved in the control of almost every biological process. These small noncoding RNAs are present in various phylogenetic groups, and a large number of them remain highly conserved at the sequence level. MicroRNA-mediated regulation depends on perfect matching between the seven nucleotides of its seed region and the target sequence usually located at the 3' untranslated region of the regulated gene. Hence, even single changes in seed regions are predicted to be deleterious as they may affect miRNA target specificity. In accordance to this, purifying selection has strongly acted on these regions. Comparison between the genomes of present-day humans from various populations, Neanderthal, and other nonhuman primates showed an miRNA, miR-1304, that carries a polymorphism on its seed region. The ancestral allele is found in Neanderthal, nonhuman primates, at low frequency (similar to 5%) in modern Asian populations and rarely in Africans. Using miRNA target site prediction algorithms, we found that the derived allele increases the number of putative target genes for the derived miRNA more than ten-fold, indicating an important functional evolution for miR-1304. Analysis of the predicted targets for derived miR-1304 indicates an association with behavior and nervous system development and function. Two of the predicted target genes for the ancestral miR-1304 allele are important genes for teeth formation, enamelin, and amelotin. MicroRNA overexpression experiments using a luciferase-based assay showed that the ancestral version of miR-1304 reduces the enamelin- and amelotin-associated reporter gene expression by 50%, whereas the derived miR-1304 does not have any effect. Deletion of the corresponding target sites for miR-1304 in these dental genes avoided their repression, which further supports their regulation by the ancestral miR-1304. Morphological studies described several differences in the dentition of Neanderthals and present-day humans like slower dentition timing and thicker enamel for present-day humans. The observed miR-1304-mediated regulation of enamelin and amelotin could at least partially underlie these differences between the two Homo species as well as other still-unraveled phenotypic differences among modern human populations."
Reductions in Primate Abundance and Diversity in a Multiuse Protected Area: Synergistic Impacts of Hunting and Logging in a Congo Basin Forest,"['Remis, MJ', 'Robinson, CAJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22012,JUL 2012,10,"This article explores spatial and temporal changes in diurnal primate abundance and behavior in response to hunting, logging, and conservation at the Dzanga Sangha Dense Forest Reserve (RDS), Central African Republic over time. We use a combination of line-transect surveys in 2002 and 2009 (N = 540 km) and ethnographic interviews (N = 210) to investigate changes in the status of cerco-pithecines and colobines at RDS, with additional comparisons to earlier work. This protected area was lightly logged in the 1970s and the park was gazetted in 1990, with multiple-use reserve sectors allocated. Since the park's inception, hunting and the trade of primates have increased, along with human migration, greater accessibility of arms, and reduction of preferred ungulate prey. Primates have declined in both the park and reserve sectors. Our data further suggest that at RDS hunting has had a greater impact on primate diversity and abundance than logging. We have identified changes in species-specific vulnerability to hunting over time, with Cercopithecus nictitans and Lophocebus albigena initially having appeared to be relatively resistant to hunting pressure in 2002. However, subsequently as gun hunting has increased at RDS, these species have become vulnerable. Although monkeys at RDS have been responding behaviorally to increased gun hunting, they are not able to keep pace with changing hunting practices.

The Effect of Low- and High-Fiber Diets on the Population of Entodiniomorphid Ciliates Troglodytella Abrassarti in Captive Chimpanzees (Pan Troglodytes),"['Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Schovancova, K', 'Profousova, I', 'Kisidayova, S', 'Varadyova, Z', 'Pekar, S', 'Kamler, J', 'Modry, D', 'AUSTRALIAN MARSUPIALS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.22021,JUL 2012,2,"Troglodytella abrassarti is an intestinal entodiniomorphid ciliate commonly diagnosed in the feces of wild and captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Entodiniomorphids could be considered to have a mutualistic relationship with the great apes, in that the ciliates benefit from the intestinal ecosystem of the host, while also contributing to the fiber fermentation process. We examined the effect of diet on the infection intensities of T. abrassarti in two captive chimpanzees in the Liberec Zoo, Czech Republic. The chimpanzees were fed a low-fiber diet (LFD) with 14% neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and a high-fiber diet (HFD; 26% NDF) for 10 days with one transition, and two 10-day adaptation periods. Fecal samples were examined coproscopically with the merthiolate-iodine-formaldehyde concentration (MIFC) technique, in order to quantify the number of ciliates per gram of feces. A significant trend of increasing T. abrassarti numbers was observed when the animals were fed the LFD, compared to when they were fed the HFD. Our results suggest, however, that infection intensities of T. abrassarti in captive chimpanzees are not influenced primarily by the amount of fiber in the diet, but rather by the dietary starch concentration (HFD: 1%; LFD: 8%).

"No Evidence for Transmission of Antibiotic-Resistant Escherichia coli Strains from Humans to Wild Western Lowland Gorillas in Lope National Park, Gabon","['Benavides, JA', 'Godreuil, S', 'Bodenham, R', 'Ratiarison, S', 'Devos, C', 'Petretto, MO', 'Raymond, M', 'Escobar-Paramo, P']",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,10.1128/AEM.07593-11,JUN 2012,7,"The intensification of human activities within the habitats of wild animals is increasing the risk of interspecies disease transmission. This risk is particularly important for great apes, given their close phylogenetic relationship with humans. Areas of high human density or intense research and ecotourism activities expose apes to a high risk of disease spillover from humans. Is this risk lower in areas of low human density? We determined the prevalence of Escherichia coli antibiotic-resistant isolates in a population of the critically endangered western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and other wild mammals in Lope National Park (LNP), Gabon, and we tested whether the observed pattern could be explained by bacterial transmission from humans and domestic animals into wildlife populations. Our results show a high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial isolates in humans and low levels in gorillas and other wildlife. The significant differences in the genetic background of the resistant bacteria isolated from humans and gorillas suggest that transmission is low or does not occur between these two species. These findings indicate that the presence of antibiotic-resistant strains in wildlife do not imply direct bacteria transmission from humans. Thus, in areas of low human density, human-wildlife E. coli transmission seems to be low. The presence of antibiotic-resistant isolates in gorillas may be better explained by other mechanisms for resistance acquisition, such as horizontal gene exchange among bacteria or naturally acquired resistance."
Linear enamel hypoplasia as an indicator of physiological stress in great apes: Reviewing the evidence in light of enamel growth variation,"['Guatelli-Steinberg, D', 'Ferrell, RJ', 'Spence, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21619,JUN 2012,7,"Physiological stress, such as malnutrition or illness, can disrupt normal enamel growth, resulting in linear enamel hypoplasias (LEHs). Although ecological factors may contribute to LEH expression, other factors, such as surface abrasion and enamel growth variables, are also likely to be involved. Attention to these other factors is necessary before we can begin to understand what LEH might signify in terms of ecological sources of physiological stress in non-human primates. This study focuses on assessing the contribution of these other factors to variation in LEH expression within and across great ape taxa. Here, we present LEH data from unabraded crown regions in samples of seven great ape species. We analyze these data with respect to lateral enamel formation time and the angles that striae of Retzius make with the enamel surface, as these variables are expected to affect variation in LEH expression. We find that although the duration of enamel formation is associated with sex differences in LEH expression, it is not clearly related to taxonomic variation in LEH expression, and does not explain the low frequency of LEH in mountain gorillas found in this and a previous study. Our data on striae of Retzius angles suggest that these influence LEH expression along the tooth crown and may contribute to the consistently high frequencies of LEH seen in Pongo in this and previous studies. We suggest that future work aimed at understanding species variation in these angles is crucial to evaluating taxonomic patterns of LEH expression in great apes. Am J Phys Anthropol 148:191204, 2012.

Simian retroviruses in African apes,"['Peeters, M', 'Delaporte, E']",CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION,10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03843.x,JUN 2012,15,"Clin Microbiol Infect 2012; 18: 514520 Abstract It is now well established that simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) from chimpanzees (SIVcpz) and gorillas (SIVgor) from west Central Africa are at the origin of HIV-1/AIDS. Apes are also infected with other retroviruses, notably simian T-cell lymphotropic viruses (STLVs) and simian foamy viruses (SFVs), that can be transmitted to humans. We discuss the actual knowledge on SIV, STLV and SFV infections in chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos. We especially elaborate on how the recent development of non-invasive methods has allowed us to identify the reservoirs of the HIV-1 ancestors in chimpanzees and gorillas, and increased our knowledge of the natural history of SIV infections in chimpanzees. Multiple cross-species events with retroviruses from apes to humans have occurred, but only one transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees in south-eastern Cameroon spread worldwide, and is responsible for the actual HIV pandemic. Frequent SFV transmissions have been recently reported, but no human-to-human transmission has been documented yet. Because humans are still in contact with apes, identification of pathogens in wild ape populations can signal which pathogens may be cause risk for humans, and allow the development of serological and molecular assays with which to detect transmissions to humans. Finally, non-invasive sampling also allows the study of the impact of retroviruses and other pathogens on the health and survival of endangered species such as chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos."
The evolution of African great ape subtelomeric heterochromatin and the fusion of human chromosome 2,"['Ventura, M', 'Catacchio, CR', 'Sajjadian, S', 'Vives, L', 'Sudmant, PH', 'Marques-Bonet, T', 'Graves, TA', 'Wilson, RK', 'Eichler, EE']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.136556.111,JUN 2012,8,"Chimpanzee and gorilla chromosomes differ from human chromosomes by the presence of large blocks of subterminal heterochromatin thought to be composed primarily of arrays of tandem satellite sequence. We explore their sequence composition and organization and show a complex organization composed of specific sets of segmental duplications that have hyperexpanded in concert with the formation of subterminal satellites. These regions are highly copy number polymorphic between and within species, and copy number differences involving hundreds of copies can be accurately estimated by assaying read-depth of next-generation sequencing data sets. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses suggest that the structures have arisen largely independently in the two lineages with the exception of a few seed sequences present in the common ancestor of humans and African apes. We propose a model where an ancestral human-chimpanzee pericentric inversion and the ancestral chromosome 2 fusion both predisposed and protected the chimpanzee and human genomes, respectively, to the formation of subtelomeric heterochromatin. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between duplicated sequences and chromosomal rearrangements that rapidly alter the cytogenetic landscape in a short period of evolutionary time."

In this review, we show how studies of the microorganisms of wild great apes can lead to the discovery of novel pathogens of importance for humans. We also illustrate how these primates, living in their natural habitats, can serve as sentinels for outbreaks of human disease in regions with a high likelihood of disease emergence. Greater sampling efforts and improvements in sample preservation and diagnostic capacity are rapidly improving our understanding of the diversity and distribution of microorganisms in wild great apes. Linking non-invasive diagnostic data with observational health data from great apes habituated to human presence is a promising approach for the discovery of pathogens of high relevance for humans."

Recovery Potential of a Western Lowland Gorilla Population following a Major Ebola Outbreak: Results from a Ten Year Study,"['Genton, C', 'Cristescu, R', 'Gatti, S', 'Levrero, F', 'Bigot, E', 'Caillaud, D', 'Pierre, JS', 'Menard, N']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0037106,MAY 23 2012,6,"Investigating the recovery capacity of wildlife populations following demographic crashes is of great interest to ecologists and conservationists. Opportunities to study these aspects are rare due to the difficulty of monitoring populations both before and after a demographic crash. Ebola outbreaks in central Africa have killed up to 95% of the individuals in affected western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) populations. Assessing whether and how fast affected populations recover is essential for the conservation of this critically endangered taxon. The gorilla population visiting Lokoue forest clearing, Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Republic of the Congo, has been monitored before, two years after and six years after Ebola affected it in 2004. This allowed us to describe Ebola's short-term and long-term impacts on the structure of the population. The size of the population, which included around 380 gorillas before the Ebola outbreak, dropped to less than 40 individuals after the outbreak. It then remained stable for six years after the outbreak. However, the demographic structure of this small population has significantly changed. Although several solitary males have disappeared, the immigration of adult females, the formation of new breeding groups, and several birth events suggest that the population is showing potential to recover. During the outbreak, surviving adult and subadult females joined old solitary silverbacks. Those females were subsequently observed joining young silverbacks, forming new breeding groups where they later gave birth. Interestingly, some females were observed joining silverbacks that were unlikely to have sired their infant, but no infanticide was observed. The consequences of the Ebola outbreak on the population structure were different two years and six years after the outbreak. Therefore, our results could be used as demographic indicators to detect and date outbreaks that have happened in other, non-monitored gorilla populations."

However, few studies have sought to investigate the interrelationships between behavior, adrenal activity, and environment, and ask whether both behavioral and adrenal monitoring strategies are required to assess welfare sufficiently. We present the findings of a 9-month study of a small group (one male, two females) of Western lowland gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla. First, we examined the effect of environmental variables on gorilla behavior. Second, we examined the effect of environmental variables on the concentration of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGC) and the relationship between behavior and FGC. Environmental variables had similar effects on all three gorillas. Negative vigilance of visitors (NVV; staring, posturing, and charging at visitors) significantly increased in all subjects as environmental noise levels increased, and food-related behavior significantly decreased in all subjects as crowd size increased. Exhibit modifications had a number of positive effects on behavior. Notably, when privacy screens were used, NVV significantly decreased in two subjects. We found no significant effects of environmental variables on FGC. However, we did find significant relationships between behavior and FGC in one female. Specifically, her NVV was significantly higher one day before, and on the same day as, raised FGC. Also, hair plucking significantly increased in the two days following raised FGC. Overall, this study demonstrates how concurrent noninvasive fecal and behavioral monitoring can be used for gorilla welfare assessment. Zoo Biol 31:306321, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Since zoos are interested in maintaining as many natural behaviors as possible, it is important to know how contraception may affect social and sexual interactions among group members. Although some data are available regarding the influence of the pill on sexual behavior in human females, no data are available on its effects on gorilla estrous behavior. We examined temporal trends of estrous, aggressive, affiliative, and activity budget data in four females on CBC at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, IL. Behavioral data were collected using point sampling, all-occurrence records, and one-zero sampling. Estrous behavior occurred in less than 1% of observations. Using all-occurrence and one-zero sampling, estrous behavior occurred more frequently in week one of the cycle than any other week. The focal females exhibited affiliative, aggressive, and activity budget data evenly across their cycles. There were also no temporal trends in proximity to the silverback. Females varied by the types of estrous behavior they exhibited.

Estrogenic plant foods of red colobus monkeys and mountain gorillas in uganda,"['Wasserman, MD', 'Taylor-Gutt, A', 'Rothman, JM', 'Chapman, CA', 'Milton, K', 'Leitman, DC']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.22045,MAY 2012,5,"Phytoestrogens, or naturally occurring estrogen-mimicking compounds, are found in many human plant foods, such as soybeans (Glycine max) and other legumes. Because the consumption of phytoestrogens may result in both health benefits of protecting against estrogen-dependent cancers and reproductive costs of disrupting the developing endocrine system, considerable biomedical research has been focused on the physiological and behavioral effects of these compounds. Despite this interest, little is known about the occurrence of phytoestrogens in the diets of wild primates, nor their likely evolutionary importance. We investigated the prevalence of estrogenic plant foods in the diets of two folivorous primate species, the red colobus monkey (Procolobus rufomitratus) of Kibale National Park and mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei) of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, both in Uganda. To examine plant foods for estrogenic activity, we screened 44 plant items (species and part) comprising 78.4% of the diet of red colobus monkeys and 53 plant items comprising 85.2% of the diet of mountain gorillas using transient transfection assays. At least 10.6% of the red colobus diet and 8.8% of the gorilla diet had estrogenic activity. This was mainly the result of the red colobus eating three estrogenic staple foods and the gorillas eating one estrogenic staple food. All estrogenic plants exhibited estrogen receptor (ER) subtype selectivity, as their phytoestrogens activated ER beta, but not ERa. These results demonstrate that estrogenic plant foods are routinely consumed by two folivorous primate species. Phytoestrogens in the wild plant foods of these two species and many other wild primates may have important implications for understanding primate reproductive ecology. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2012.

Information seeking by orangutans: a generalized search strategy?,"['Marsh, HL', 'MacDonald, SE']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0453-y,MAY 2012,16,"Recent empirical work has suggested that some species of non-human primates may be aware of their knowledge states. One finding to support this claim is that they seek information about the location of a hidden food item when they are unsure of its location, but not when they already know where it is, which purportedly demonstrates metacognition. However, this behaviour may instead reflect a generalized search strategy, in which subjects reach for food when they see it, and search for it when they do not. In this experiment, this possibility was addressed by testing orangutans in three conditions in which the location of a food item was sometimes known to subjects, and other times required subjects to visually seek the missing information. All subjects exhibited behaviour consistent with a metacognitive interpretation in at least two of the three conditions. Critically, in two of the conditions, subjects refrained from seeking visual information, and correctly found the hidden food item without ever seeing it, using inference by exclusion. The results suggest that animals that succeed in this information-seeking task are not merely acting according to a generalized search strategy, and instead seek information adaptively according to their knowledge states."
Differences in cognitive processes underlying the collaborative activities of children and chimpanzees,"['Fletcher, GE', 'Warneken, F', 'Tomasello, M']",COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT,10.1016/j.cogdev.2012.02.003,APR-JUN 2012,17,"We compared the performance of 3- and 5-year-old children with that of chimpanzees in two tasks requiring collaboration via complementary roles. In both tasks, children and chimpanzees were able to coordinate two complementary roles with peers and solve the problem cooperatively. This is the first experimental demonstration of the coordination of complementary roles in chimpanzees. In the second task, neither species was skillful at waiting for a partner to be positioned appropriately before beginning (although children did hesitate significantly longer when the partner was absent). The main difference between species in both tasks was in children's, but not chimpanzees', ability to profit from experience as a collaborator in one role when later reversing roles. This difference suggests that as they participate in a collaboration, young children integrate both roles into a single ""birds-eye-view"" representational format in a way that chimpanzees do not.

Loss of habitat reduces the carrying capacity of the landscape and fragmentation disrupts biological processes and exposes wildlife populations to the effects of small population size, such as reduction of genetic diversity and increased impact of demographic stochasticity. The Critically Endangered Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli is threatened in particular by habitat disturbance because its population is small and it lives in an area where high human population density results in intense exploitation of natural resources. We used remotely-sensed data to assess the extent and distribution of gorilla habitat in the Cross River region and delineated potential dispersal corridors. Our analysis revealed >8,000 km(2) of tropical forest in the study region, 2,500 km(2) of which is in or adjacent to areas occupied by gorillas. We surveyed 12 areas of forest identified as potential gorilla habitat, 10 of which yielded new records of gorillas. The new records expand the known range of the Cross River gorilla by >50%, and support genetic analyses that suggest greater connectivity of the population than previously assumed. These findings demonstrate that considerable connected forest habitat remains and that the area could potentially support a much larger gorilla population if anthropogenic pressures such as hunting could be reduced."
"Epidemiology and Molecular Relationships of Cryptosporidium spp. in People, Primates, and Livestock from Western Uganda","['Salyer, SJ', 'Gillespie, TR', 'Rwego, IB', 'Chapman, CA', 'Goldberg, TL']",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,10.1371/journal.pntd.0001597,APR 2012,20,"Background: Cryptosporidium is one of the most common parasitic diarrheal agents in the world and is a known zoonosis. We studied Cryptosporidium in people, livestock, and non-human primates in the region of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Land use change near the park has resulted in fragmented forest patches containing small, remnant populations of wild primates that interact intensively with local people and livestock. Our goal was to investigate risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection and to assess cross-species transmission using molecular methods.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Diagnostic PCR revealed a prevalence of Cryptosporidium of 32.4% in humans, 11.1% in non-human primates, and 2.2% in livestock. In the case of humans, residence in one particular community was associated with increased risk of infection, as was fetching water from an open water source. Although 48.5% of infected people reported gastrointestinal symptoms, this frequency was not significantly different in people who tested negative (44.7%) for Cryptosporidium, nor was co-infection with Giardia duodenalis associated with increased reporting of gastrointestinal symptoms. Fecal consistency was no different in infected versus uninfected people or animals. DNA sequences of the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein gene placed all infections within a well-supported C. parvum/C. hominis clade. However, the only two sequences recovered from primates in the core of the park's protected area fell into a divergent sub-clade and were identical to published sequences from C. parvum, C. hominis, and C. cuniculus, suggesting the possibility of a separate sylvatic transmission cycle.

Conclusions/Significance: Cryptosporidium may be transmitted frequently among species in western Uganda where people, livestock, and wildlife interact intensively as a result of anthropogenic changes to forests, but the parasite may undergo more host-specific transmission where such interactions do not occur. The parasite does not appear to have strong effects on human or animal health, perhaps because of persistent low-level shedding and immunity."

This study, using an habituation/dishabituation task, provides experimental evidence for a core olfactory ability, namely, olfactory discrimination, in the gorilla. In Experiment 1, six zoo-housed western lowland gorillas were individually presented with the same odour on four trials, and with a novel odour on the fifth trial. Odours (almond and vanilla) were presented on plastic balls, and behavioural responses of sniffing and chewing/licking the balls were recorded. A second experiment presented the same odour on four trials and no odour on the fifth to examine whether any dishabituation was due to the presence of a new odour or the absence of the familiar odour. Gorillas habituated their behaviour with repeated presentation of the same odour, but dishabituated, i.e. increased sniffing and chewing/licking, when presented with the novel odour. No dishabituation was noted when using water as the stimulus across all trials or when used as the novel odour. Overall, results show that gorillas are able to discriminate between odours."

Previous work has found that increased phalangeal curvature may be indicative of increased grasping during suspensory and climbing behaviors, but the details of this relationship, particularly as regards feet, is still unclear. Using behavioral studies to predict an interspecific gradient of variation in pedal phalangeal curvature, I collected digital data from the third and fifth digit proximal pedal phalanges in adult Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Pongo pygmaeus and calculated included angles of phalangeal curvature to assess the appropriateness of pooling digits within taxa and evaluate the association between variation in pedal phalangeal curvature and frequency of climbing behavior. I also used an ontogenetic sample of Pan troglodytes to evaluate the postnatal relationship between variation in phalangeal curvature and grasping behaviors. I found intraspecific variation in phalangeal curvature suggesting among-digit variation in grasping behaviors. Curvature of Pongo was significantly greater than of both Pan and Gorilla. In contrast, Pan was significantly more curved than Gorilla only in comparison of third digits. Ontogenetic decreases in pedal phalangeal curvature among Pan troglodytes accorded well with postnatal decreases in documented climbing frequency. These findings largely support earlier work regarding the association between arboreal grasping and phalangeal curvature, and provide a unique intraspecific analysis that illuminates a number of areas where our knowledge of the behavioral and biomechanical determinants of phalangeal curvature should be explored further, particularly with respect to the role of among-digit variation in phalangeal curvature."

Nevertheless, similar tumours have only been rarely described in Great Apes. This report characterizes the pathological and molecular features of a metastatic endocervical adenocarcinoma in a Western lowland gorilla (Gorilla g. gorilla).

Methods Necropsy and histopathology was performed to identify the cause of the disease in an cachectic 50-year-old western lowland gorilla. Immunohistochemistry for Ki67, oestrogen receptor alpha and ERBB2 was performed to characterize the tumor. In addition, Pan-herpesvirus and Pan-papillomavirus PCR were used to identify a possible viral cause.

Results The endoccervical carcinoma showed a severe metastatic spread to the lung, brain and bone and was herpesvirus and papillomavirus-negative. Most tumor cells were ERBB2-positive, 15% of tumor cells were Ki67positive and only few tumor cells had oestrogen receptor alpha expression.

Conclusions Histopathologically and immunohistochemically, the tumour had striking similarities to human endocervicial adenocarcinomas of the common type. However, PCR analysis failed to identify herpes-or papillomaviral DNA in the tumor at the time of necropsy, thus leaving the question for cause of the disease open."

Despite a large degree of sexual dimorphism among haplorhine primates, phenotypic traits that may influence the reproductive success of males are largely unstudied due to long life spans and the difficulties in quantifying such traits non-invasively. Here we employ digital photogrammetry of body length and crest size, as well as ranking of the gluteal muscle size, to test whether these sexually dimorphic traits are associated with long-term measures of male reproductive success in western gorillas. Among 19 adult male gorillas monitored for up to 12.5 years, we found that all three phenotypic traits were positively correlated with the average number of mates per male, but only crest size and gluteal muscle size were significantly correlated with offspring survival and the annual rate of siring offspring that survive to weaning age. We discuss why such sexually dimorphic traits might be under ongoing selection in gorillas and other species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Long-Term Balancing Selection at the Antiviral Gene OAS1 in Central African Chimpanzees,"['Ferguson, W', 'Dvora, S', 'Fikes, RW', 'Stone, AC', 'Boissinot, S']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msr247,APR 2012,8,"Oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) are interferon-induced enzymes that participate in the first line of defense against a wide range of viral infection in animals. Upon activation by viral double-stranded RNA, OAS synthesizes (2-5) oligoadenylates, which activate RNase L, leading to the nonspecific degradation of cellular and viral RNA. Some association studies in humans suggest that variation at one of the OAS genes, OAS1, could be influencing host susceptibility to viral infection. We assessed the diversity of OAS1 in hominoid primates with a focus on chimpanzees. We found that the OAS1 gene is extremely polymorphic in Central African chimpanzee and exhibits levels of silent and replacement diversity much higher than neutral regions of the chimpanzee genome. This level of variation strongly suggests that balancing selection is acting on OAS1, and indeed, this conclusion was validated by several tests of neutrality. We further demonstrated that balancing selection has been acting at this locus since the split between chimpanzees, humans, and gorillas (similar to 8.6 Ma) and caused the persistence of two deeply divergent allelic lineages in Central African chimpanzees. These two groups of OAS1 alleles differ by a large number of amino acids (a.a.), including several a.a. putatively involved in RNA binding. It is therefore very likely that variation at the OAS1 locus affects the innate immune response of individuals to specific viral infection. Our data strongly suggest that interactions between viral RNA and OAS1 are responsible for the maintenance of ancestral polymorphisms at this locus for at least 13.2 My."

Human MSLNL has a nonsense mutation in exon 10 and two polymorphic mutations: a frameshift in exon 3 and a nonsense codon in exon 8. The gorilla gene also shows multiple deleterious mutations, including a premature stop codon, a deletion, and a splice site mutation. Molecular evolutionary analysis indicated relaxed selection pressure on MSLNL in African great ape lineages, which suggested that MSLNL might have become inactivated before the divergence of human, chimpanzee and gorilla. The mouse Mslnl gene is highly expressed in olfactory epithelium and moderately expressed in several other tissues. We propose that the loss of MSLNL may be associated with the evolution of the olfactory system in African great apes including human. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Species Association of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) in Non-Human Apes; Evidence for Recombination between Gorilla and Chimpanzee Variants,"['Lyons, S', 'Sharp, C', 'LeBreton, M', 'Djoko, CF', 'Kiyang, JA', 'Lankester, F', 'Bibila, TG', 'Tamoufe, U', 'Fair, J', 'Wolfe, ND', 'Simmonds, P']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0033430,MAR 14 2012,9,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are widely distributed in humans, infecting approximately one third of the world's population.

To investigate species-specificity and potential for cross species transmission of HBV between sympatric species of apes (such as gorillas and chimpanzees in Central Africa) or between humans and chimpanzees or gorillas, variants of HBV infecting captive wild-born non-human primates were genetically characterised. 9 of 62 chimpanzees (11.3%) and two from 11 gorillas (18%) were HBV-infected (15% combined frequency), while other Old world monkey species were negative. Complete genome sequences were obtained from six of the infected chimpanzee and both gorillas; those from P. t. ellioti grouped with previously characterised variants from this subspecies. However, variants recovered from P. t. troglodytes HBV variants also grouped within this clade, indicative of transmission between sub-species, forming a paraphyletic clade. The two gorilla viruses were phylogenetically distinct from chimpanzee and human variants although one showed evidence for a recombination event with a P.t.e.-derived HBV variant in the partial X and core gene region. Both of these observations provide evidence for circulation of HBV between different species and sub-species of non-human primates, a conclusion that differs from the hypothesis if of strict host specificity of HBV genotypes."

In 30% of the genome, gorilla is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other; this is rarer around coding genes, indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution, and has functional consequences in gene expression. A comparison of protein coding genes reveals approximately 500 genes showing accelerated evolution on each of the gorilla, human and chimpanzee lineages, and evidence for parallel acceleration, particularly of genes involved in hearing. We also compare the western and eastern gorilla species, estimating an average sequence divergence time 1.75 million years ago, but with evidence for more recent genetic exchange and a population bottleneck in the eastern species. The use of the genome sequence in these and future analyses will promote a deeper understanding of great ape biology and evolution."
The Effect of Feeding Enrichment Methods on the Behavior of Captive Western Lowland Gorillas,"['Ryan, EB', 'Proudfoot, KL', 'Fraser, D']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20403,MAR-APR 2012,1,"Three feeding enrichment treatments were tested in an outdoor yard used by six Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). In ""Yard-toss,"" forage was thrown by hand over one third of the yard. In ""Set-up,"" forage and browse were hand-scattered throughout the yard. ""Set-up Enriched"" was similar with the addition of either a hay- and forage-filled feeder or forage-filled boomer ball(s) suspended from a climbing structure. Each treatment was presented on 5 d. Behavior was recorded for 30 min before (baseline) and 30 min after the start of each treatment. All treatments led to more foraging and less inactivity compared with baseline (P<0.05), but Yard-toss was the least effective, likely because resources were clumped and monopolized by dominant animals. In Set-up Enriched, dominant animals had the greatest increase in foraging (P=0.03), partly because they generally monopolized the suspended items, but this allowed others to forage at ground level. This separation of the animals likely explains why Set-Up Enriched led to more foraging than all other treatments (P<0.05). Findings show that for these hierarchical animals, enrichment resources are most effective when distributed widely, including vertically, and that enrichment strategies must take social structure into account.

Use of Buckets as Tools by Western Lowland Gorillas,"['Margulis, SW', 'Steele, GR', 'Kleinfelder, RE']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.21001,MAR-APR 2012,1,"While all great apes have been documented to use tools, gorillas are arguably the least proficient tool users. In 2009, a Western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at the Buffalo Zoo was observed using a bucket, which had been provided as part of normal enrichment, as a tool to collect water. We conducted a brief, ad libitum investigation to confirm the validity of the initial observation. We then carried out a systematic investigation of the behavior in 2010. We collected 72 hr of videotaped data and tested the null hypothesis that the gorillas did not differ in their prevalence of engaging in bucket-use behaviors. We documented that all four adult gorillas in the group used buckets as drinking tools; however, there was significant individual variation in frequency and type of use of buckets. Four of the eight behaviors showed significant variation among individuals. The silverback male and the youngest adult female contacted and held the bucket significantly more than the remaining two adult females. The young female carried and drank from the bucket significantly more than any other individual. Furthermore, she was observed to fill the bucket with water four of the six times during which this behavior was observed. These data provide evidence of the ability of gorillas to utilize tools, given the appropriate environmental conditions. We continue to explore the abilities of gorillas to recognize the functionality of buckets as tools. Zoo Biol 31: 260-266, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Although the position of the middle cervical ganglion (MG) in the great apes tended to be relatively lower than that in humans, the morphology of the ECNP in adult great apes was almost consistent with that in adult humans but essentially different from that in the lesser apes or gibbons. Therefore, the well-argued anatomical question of when did the MG acquire communicating branches with the spinal cervical nerves and appear constantly in all sympathetic cardiac nerves during primate evolution is clearly considered to be after the great apes and gibbons split. Moreover, a horizontal four-chambered heart and a lifted cardiac apex with a relatively large volume in newborn great apes rapidly changed its position downward, as seen in humans during postnatal growth and was associated with a reduction in the hepatic volume by imaging diagnosis and gross anatomy. In addition, our observation using a range of postnatal stages exhibits that two sympathetic ganglia, the middle cervical and cervicothoracic ganglia, differed between the early and later postnatal stages.

In long-lived species, accurate estimations of demographic parameters are difficult to obtain, and therefore assessment of reintroduction success in such species is challenging. To assess the initial success of a reintroduction program for the long-lived, slow-reproducing, and critically endangered western lowland gorilla Gorilla gorilla gorilla, we analyzed postrelease monitoring data from 2 reintroduced populations, in the Bateke Plateau region of the Republics of Congo and Gabon, to quantify several demographic parameters, and compared our results with published data on wild gorilla populations. Annual survival rate of the 51 released gorillas was 97.4%, 9 females gave birth to 11 infants at an annual birth rate of 0.196 births per adult female, and first-year survival of the infants was 81.8%. Annual birth rate within the reintroduced populations is not significantly different from that given for wild western gorilla populations, and other demographic parameters fall within the range of published data for wild gorilla populations. Our analysis illustrates that the reintroduction program has been successful in terms of the initial measures of postrelease survival and reproduction, and our quantitative data should facilitate the development of a population model that can predict the probability of population persistence and therefore provide an indication of longer-term reintroduction success."

We measured fermentation parameters in fecal samples of 4 hindgut fermenting species (Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Papio hamadryas, Cercopithecus neglectus) and 1 foregut fermenting species (Colobus guereza) to determine whether differences in SCFA profiles exist between the 2 digestive systems. We analyzed SCFA profiles, culture pH, and methane from fecal samples collected at the North Carolina Zoological Park. Results indicate that the captive individuals exhibit high total SCFA concentrations, with a particularly high acetate-to-propionate ratio. Methane levels were highest in the 2 ape species, and lowest in Colobus guereza and Cercopithecus neglectus. Total SCFA concentrations were similar between wild and captive-born Gorilla gorilla, although concentrations of acetate were significantly greater -and butyrate concentration and methane production significantly lower- in wild-caught gorillas relative to captive-born. These results are consistent with data on diet and digestive retention times among Catarrhini and have implications for our understanding of the interactions among diet, body mass, digestion, and how monogastric cercopithecines can consume either similar or greater levels of fiber than larger-bodied apes."
Assessing inactivity in zoo gorillas using keeper ratings and behavioral data,"['Less, EH', 'Kuhar, CW', 'Dennis, PM', 'Lukas, KE']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2012.01.001,FEB 2012,1,"One way to address the problem of small sample size in zoo research is to conduct a study involving multiple institutions. However, when conducting behavioral research, it can be difficult for one investigator to travel to each institution or for staff at individual institutions to find time to collect behavioral data. This study validates keeper assessments of western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) activity levels against behavioral data collected systematically in the zoo setting. Our purpose in validating a keeper rating of inactivity was to increase efficiency of behavioral data collection and maximize the amount of activity information for a larger study on gorilla health and behavior. A questionnaire was sent to 15 Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) institutions housing 63 gorillas (37 male, 26 female) gorillas. Behavioral data for the project were collected by staff at each institution and/or by the principal invesitgator (PI) using group scan sampling. Every data collector was reliability tested by video until they gained >90% agreement with the PI. Mean percent of time spent in a behavior was calculated from the scan data. In this case, the focus was on the time spent immobile (i.e., stationary) and time spent idle (i.e., at rest, performing no otherwise defined active behaviors). We examined the correlation between the keepers' ratings and time spent immobile and idle as calculated from the behavioral data. Behavioral data on individuals that spent more time immobile were significantly correlated with an increasingly inactive ranking by staff (P = 0.003). Time spent idle was significantly correlated with time spent immobile (P = 0.001) and time spent idle was also significantly correlated with an increasingly inactive ranking by staff (P < 0.001). This study demonstrates that keeper ratings of activity can be an accurate method to glean information on gorilla behavior in zoos when the more ideal mode of behavioral data collection cannot be used. Because this method is a simple way to collect data, it can increase sample size and facilitate multi-institutional studies. However, a keeper rating should always be validated with behavioral data before used as a replacement form of data collection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

In this paper, we discuss some of the ways in which the need to be able to address problems of varying kinds and complexity can be met by different information processing systems. We also discuss different ways in which relevant information can be obtained, and how different kinds of information can be processed and used, by both biological organisms and artificial agents. We analyse several constraints and design features, and show how they relate both to biological organisms, and to lessons that can be learned from building artificial systems. Our standpoint overlaps with Karmiloff-Smith (1992) in that we assume that a collection of mechanisms geared to learning and developing in biological environments are available in forms that constrain, but do not determine, what can or will be learnt by individuals.

Are great apes tested with an abject object-choice task?,"['Mulcahy, NJ', 'Hedge, V']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.11.019,FEB 2012,23,"A surprising finding in comparative social cognition is that great apes seem to have difficulties understanding others' communicative behaviour. In no other paradigm is this more evident than in the object-choice task in which subjects use a human cue, such as pointing, to infer the correct choice of a reward hidden in one of a number of containers. Apes often perform poorly in the task whereas many other species succeed. One popular explanation for this finding is that apes have not evolved the propensity to understand others' communicative behaviour because their social systems are based predominantly on competitive relationships. We caution against this hypothesis by highlighting recent experimental evidence that suggests methodological factors are responsible for the apes' poor performance in object-choice studies. Furthermore, we compared the methodology and results of 63 published object-choice studies in a range of animal taxa. We found that the central object-choice method that is only used with apes and other primates typically results in failure. When, however, modifications are made to this method or apes are tested with a peripheral method that is similar to the one used with many other species, their performance vastly improves. We discuss the significance of this in relation to past object-choice research and make several recommendations as to how future research can be improved upon so that apes are tested in a manner comparable to the testing of other animal species.

Onset and early use of gestural communication in nonhuman great apes,"['Schneider, C', 'Call, J', 'Liebal, K']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.21011,FEB 2012,3,"The early gesturing of six bonobos, eight chimpanzees, three gorillas, and eight orangutans was systematically documented using focal animal sampling. Apes' were observed during their first 20 months of life in an effort to investigate: (i) the onset of gesturing; (ii) the order in which signals of different sensory modalities appear; (iii) the extent to which infants make use of these modalities in their early signaling; and (iv) the behavioral contexts where signals are employed. Orangutans differed in important gestural characteristics to African ape species. Most notably, they showed the latest gestural onset and were more likely to use their early signals in food-related interactions. Tactile and visual signals appeared similarly early across all four species. In African apes, however, visual signaling gained prominence over time while tactile signaling decreased. These findings suggest that motor ability, which encourages independence from caregivers, is an important antecedent, among others, in gestural onset and development, a finding which warrants further investigation."
Facilitating Play Through Communication: Significance of Teeth Exposure in the Gorilla Play Face,"['Waller, BM', 'Cherry, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.21018,FEB 2012,5,"Primate facial expressions (FEs) likely play an important role in primate society: through facial signals, individuals can potentially send and receive information and may benefit from coordinating their behavior accordingly. Many primates use a relaxed open mouth (ROM) facial display or play face (PF) during play behavior, where the mouth is open but teeth are covered. In addition to this conventional PF, however, Western Lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) also use a full PF where the upper teeth are exposed. As the teeth are similarly exposed in the bared-teeth expression (which is a signal of appeasement, submission and/or affiliation), the full PF may be a blend of the PF and bared-teeth face, and have a different signal function to the PF alone. Focal animal sampling of captive Western Lowland gorillas (N = 10) showed that the full PF was more often observed in intense rather than gentle play, and intense play bouts that featured the full PF were longer than those that featured only the PF. Both expressions were associated with an increase in affinitive behavior between sender and receiver postplay, but only the full PF was associated with an increase higher than that of play alone. Overall, the findings suggest that the full PF has an additional role in coordinating and maintaining play, possibly though reducing uncertainty in the receiver and confirming that play is only play."
"Park Gazettement and Integrated Conservation and Development as Factors in Community Conflict at Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda","['Baker, J', 'Milner-Gulland, EJ', 'Leader-Williams, N']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01777.x,FEB 2012,6,"Conflicts between protected-area managers and local people are common, but the drivers of conflict are rarely analyzed. This limits opportunities to identify strategies that reduce conflict and the magnitude of resulting threats to conservation. Integrated conservation and development (ICD) was adopted at Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda, to reduce conflict during gazettement of the national park, but the success of this approach remains contested. We retrieved documents of conflict written by park staff and local people from 1986 through 2000 (before, during, and after gazettement). We extracted data on 48 incidences of violent conflict and categorized them by gazettement period, area, instigator, and type to undertake a historical analysis of the triggers of violent conflict at Bwindi. Before and during gazettement, local villagers instigated most of the conflict incidents when law-enforcement efforts sought to halt commercial activities within Bwindi. No conflict arose from the arrest of villagers collecting subsistence resources during these periods. After gazettement, prohibitions on commercial activities continued to drive conflict even though villagers collecting subsistence resources were arrested more frequently than before gazettement, and local attitudes toward the park had improved following receipt of ICD benefits. Law-enforcement efforts targeted commercial activities to reduce this threat to Bwindi's mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), although the activities remained important income sources for people in villages near Bwindi. Losing commercial income following gazettement therefore appeared to be their primary motivation for instigating conflict with park rangers. Prohibitions on subsistence resource use triggered conflict less often. Our use of typologies for a multivariate conflict analysis demonstrates that by identifying differences between effects of conservation as drivers of conflict, conflict analysis can enable a more strategic deployment of conflictresolution measures that could further conservation efforts. At Bwindi targeting ICD toward individuals who lost benefits from commercial activities may strengthen the role of ICD in conflict resolution and conservation."

Among our closest living relatives, chimpanzees are found to consume plants with pharmacological properties. Providing insight on the origins of human self-medication, this study investigates the role social systems and physiology (namely gut specialization) play on learning mechanisms involved in the consumption of unusual and potentially bioactive foods by two great ape species. We collected data from a community of 41-44 wild chimpanzees in Uganda (11 months, 2008), and a group of 11-13 wild western gorillas in Central African Republic (10 months, 2008-2009). During feeding, we recorded food consumed, its availability, and social interactions (including observers watching conspecifics and the observers' subsequent activity). Unusual food consumption in chimpanzees was twice higher than in gorillas. Additionally chimpanzees relied more on social information with vertical knowledge transmission on unusual foods by continually acquiring information during their life through mostly observing the fittest (pre-senescent) adults. In contrast, in gorillas observational learning primarily occurred between related immatures, showing instead the importance of horizontal knowledge transmission. As chimpanzees' guts are physiologically less specialized than gorillas (more capable of detoxifying harmful compounds), unusual-food consumption may be more risky for chimpanzees and linked to reasons other than nutrition (like self-medication). Our results show that differences in sociality and physiology between the two species may influence mechanisms that discriminate between plants for nutrition and plants with potential therapeutic dietary components. We conclude that self-medication may have appeared in our ancestors in association with high social tolerance and lack of herbivorous gut specialization. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
The neural and cognitive correlates of aimed throwing in chimpanzees: a magnetic resonance image and behavioural study on a unique form of social tool use,"['Hopkins, WD', 'Russell, JL', 'Schaeffer, JA']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2011.0195,JAN 12 2012,10,"It has been hypothesized that neurological adaptations associated with evolutionary selection for throwing may have served as a precursor for the emergence of language and speech in early hominins. Although there are reports of individual differences in aimed throwing in wild and captive apes, to date there has not been a single study that has examined the potential neuroanatomical correlates of this very unique tool-use behaviour in non-human primates. In this study, we examined whether differences in the ratio of white (WM) to grey matter (GM) were evident in the homologue to Broca's area as well as the motor-hand area of the precentral gyrus (termed the KNOB) in chimpanzees that reliably throw compared with those that do not. We found that the proportion of WM in Broca's homologue and the KNOB was significantly higher in subjects that reliably throw compared with those that do not. We further found that asymmetries in WM within both brain regions were larger in the hemisphere contralateral to the chimpanzee's preferred throwing hand. We also found that chimpanzees that reliably throw show significantly better communication abilities than chimpanzees that do not. These results suggest that chimpanzees that have learned to throw have developed greater cortical connectivity between primary motor cortex and the Broca's area homologue. It is suggested that during hominin evolution, after the split between the lines leading to chimpanzees and humans, there was intense selection on increased motor skills associated with throwing and that this potentially formed the foundation for left hemisphere specialization associated with language and speech found in modern humans."
The origins of non-human primates' manual gestures,"['Liebal, K', 'Call, J']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2011.0044,JAN 12 2012,23,"The increasing body of research into human and non-human primates' gestural communication reflects the interest in a comparative approach to human communication, particularly possible scenarios of language evolution. One of the central challenges of this field of research is to identify appropriate criteria to differentiate a gesture from other non-communicative actions. After an introduction to the criteria currently used to define non-human primates' gestures and an overview of ongoing research, we discuss different pathways of how manual actions are transformed into manual gestures in both phylogeny and ontogeny. Currently, the relationship between actions and gestures is not only investigated on a behavioural, but also on a neural level. Here, we focus on recent evidence concerning the differential laterality of manual actions and gestures in apes in the framework of a functional asymmetry of the brain for both hand use and language."
"A word in the hand: action, gesture and mental representation in humans and non-human primates","['Cartmill, EA', 'Beilock, S', 'Goldin-Meadow, S']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2011.0162,JAN 12 2012,26,"The movements we make with our hands both reflect our mental processes and help to shape them. Our actions and gestures can affect our mental representations of actions and objects. In this paper, we explore the relationship between action, gesture and thought in both humans and non-human primates and discuss its role in the evolution of language. Human gesture (specifically representational gesture) may provide a unique link between action and mental representation. It is kinaesthetically close to action and is, at the same time, symbolic. Non-human primates use gesture frequently to communicate, and do so flexibly. However, their gestures mainly resemble incomplete actions and lack the representational elements that characterize much of human gesture. Differences in the mirror neuron system provide a potential explanation for non-human primates' lack of representational gestures; the monkey mirror system does not respond to representational gestures, while the human system does. In humans, gesture grounds mental representation in action, but there is no evidence for this link in other primates. We argue that gesture played an important role in the transition to symbolic thought and language in human evolution, following a cognitive leap that allowed gesture to incorporate representational elements."

We explore this proposition for primates and felids by examining coarse scale overlaps in geographical distributions, using IUCN Red List assessments of the primary threats posed to each species. A global analysis of primates and felids that face common threats reveals the greatest overlap is in Central and South Asia, where up to 14 primates and felids co-occur. More than 80% of the land where at least 1 threatened species of either primate or felid occurs also contains at least one threatened species of the other taxon, yet over 60% of these grid cells containing both threatened primates and felids lie outside Conservation International's hot spots. A review of IUCN Action Plans of the threats to felids and primates strongly supports the hypothesis that they are often the same and occur in the same place. In principle, steps to conserve big cats have the potential to benefit several species of threatened primates, and vice versa. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel"
Non-Human Predator Interactions with Wild Great Apes in Africa and the Use of Camera Traps to Study Their Dynamics,"['Klailova, M', 'Casanova, C', 'Henschel, P', 'Lee, P', 'Rovero, F', 'Todd, A']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000342143,2012,2,"The slow life histories of great apes (hereafter 'apes') combined with a growing inventory of predation incidents suggest that apes may be strongly affected by direct predation, as well as by predation risk. Predation risk may shape and increase behavioural flexibility by forcing individuals to adapt their behaviour to predator patterns. Forest leopards are an apex predator of primates in African rain forests and may represent a significant risk to ape populations. More field data are needed to further elucidate the behavioural modifications of apes in response to predation. We present research methods that combine the use of remote camera traps, capture-mark-recapture statistics and occupancy modelling to study predator-African ape relationships and potential antipredator behaviour through spatial variation in species co-occurrence patterns.

A Bayesian Method for Estimating Evolutionary History,"['Kim, J', 'Anthony, NM', 'Larget, BR']",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA732,2012,2,"Phylogeography is the study of evolutionary history among populations in a species associated with geographic genetic variation. This paper examines the phylogeography of three African gorilla subspecies based on two types of DNA sequence data. One type is HV1, the first hyper-variable region in the control region of the mitochondrial genome. The other type is nuclear mitochondrial DNA (Numt DNA), which results from the introgression of a copy of HV1 from the mitochondrial genome into the nuclear genome. Numt and HV1 sequences evolve independently when in different organelles, but they share a common evolutionary history at the same locus in the mitochondrial genome prior to introgression. This study estimates the evolutionary history of gorilla populations in terms of population divergence times and effective population sizes. Also, this study estimates the number of introgression events. The estimates are obtained in a Bayesian framework using novel Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The method is based on a hybrid coalescent process that combines separate coalescent processes for HV1 and Numt sequences along with a transfer model for introgression events within a single population tree. This Bayesian method for the analysis of Numt and HV1 sequences is the first approach specifically designed to model the evolutionary history of homologous multi-locus sequences within a population tree framework. The data analysis reveals highly discordant estimates of the divergence time between eastern and western gorilla populations for HV1 and Numt sequences. The discordant east-west split times are evidence of male-mediated gene flow between east and west long after female gorillas stopped this migration. In addition, the analysis estimates multiple independent introgression events."
A comparison of two home range modeling methods using Ugandan mountain gorilla data,"['Scull, P', 'Palmer, M', 'Frey, F', 'Kraly, E']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,10.1080/13658816.2012.691507,2012,3,"Home range is the area over which animals traverse in the course of their normal daily activities. Home range measures are essential to understanding a species' behavioral ecology and can be critical information for biological conservation. In the realm of mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) management at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, home range is typically calculated using the minimum convex polygon (MCP) approach. However, geographic information system has enabled more robust measures of home range to be calculated from field data. In order to assess the potential utility of a new home range modeling method, local convex hull (LoCoH), we compared LoCoH home ranges with those derived from MCP for several different gorilla groups. First, we evaluated the sensitivity of each method to outliers. Second, we compared the size of yearly home ranges for groups with distinctively different ranging behavior. Third, we compared the proportion of yearly home range found outside the park for two different groups. As anticipated, we found that LoCoH ranges are smaller (similar to 50%) than MCP ranges, but contrary to expectation our data show that MCP is not more sensitive to outliers than LoCoH. Our comparison also illustrates that the two methods result in different proportions of home range found outside the park; overall, MCP had a tendency to underestimate relative to LoCoH. Our results illustrate the importance of selecting an appropriate home range model for the spatial pattern of the data being modeled, the environment and context where the data were collected, and the motivation of the research. Overall, we found LoCoH to be a more effective home range modeling method for mountain gorilla conservation management."
Aversion to violation of expectations of food distribution: the role of social tolerance and relative dominance in seven primate species,"['Amici, F', 'Call, J', 'Aureli, F']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/156853912X637833,2012,6,"Studies on how animals behave when two partners receive different amounts of food have produced variable results, with individuals responding negatively to specific food distributions in some cases (e.g., when food is distributed unequally between partners), but not in others. In this study, we used a simple experimental approach to (i) assess the strictness of dominance relationships based on the degree of social tolerance and (ii) compare the behavioural responses of seven primate species (chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes; bonobos, Pan paniscus; gorillas, Gorilla gorilla; orangutans, Pan go pygmaeus; brown capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella; spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi; long-tailed macaques, Macaca fascicularis), when two partners received different amounts of food and no effort was required. We predicted that negative responses (i.e., refusal to participate in the task or avoidance of proximity to the food source) would be elicited by food distributions that violate the individual expectations based on tolerance levels and subject's dominance rank relative to the partner. In the 'tolerance' task, we found that species with less strict dominance relationships were chimpanzees and bonobos, followed by orangutans, spider monkeys, gorillas, brown capuchin monkeys and long-tailed macaques. In the 'food distribution' task, capuchin monkeys and especially macaques showed their aversion by refusing to participate in most conditions, including the ones with equal food distribution. When dominants received more food than the partner, subjects of all species maintained a comparable amount of proximity to the food source,"

Is caching the key to exclusion in corvids? The case of carrion crows (Corvus corone corone),"['Mikolasch, S', 'Kotrschal, K', 'Schloegl, C']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0434-1,JAN 2012,17,"Recently, two corvid species, food-caching ravens and non-caching jackdaws, have been tested in an exclusion performance (EP) task. While the ravens chose by exclusion, the jackdaws did not. Thus, foraging behaviour may affect EP abilities. To investigate this possibility, another food-caching corvid species, the carrion crow (Corvus corone corone), was tested in the same exclusion task. We hid food under one of two cups and subsequently lifted either both cups, or the baited or the un-baited cup. The crows were significantly above chance when both cups were lifted or when only the baited cup was lifted. When the empty cup was lifted, we found considerable inter-individual variation, with some birds having a significant preference for the un-baited but manipulated cup. In a follow-up task, we always provided the birds with the full information about the food location, but manipulated in which order they saw the hiding or the removal of food. Interestingly, they strongly preferred the cup which was manipulated last, even if it did not contain any food. Therefore, we repeated the first experiment but controlled for the movement of the cups. In this case, more crows found the food reliably in the un-baited condition. We conclude that carrion crows are able to choose by exclusion, but local enhancement has a strong influence on their performance and may overshadow potential inferential abilities. However, these findings support the hypothesis that caching might be a key to exclusion in corvids."
The leukemia associated nuclear corepressor ETO homologue genes MTG16 and MTGR1 are regulated differently in hematopoietic cells,"['Ajore, R', 'Kumar, P', 'Dhanda, RS', 'Gullberg, U', 'Olsson, I']",BMC MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,10.1186/1471-2199-13-11,MAR 23 2012,1,"Background: MTG16, MTGR1 and ETO are nuclear transcriptional corepressors of the human ETO protein family. MTG16 is implicated in hematopoietic development and in controlling erythropoiesis/megakaryopoiesis. Furthermore, ETO homologue genes are 3'participants in leukemia fusions generated by chromosomal translocations responsible of hematopoietic dysregulation. We tried to identify structural and functional promoter elements of MTG16 and MTGR1 genes in order to find associations between their regulation and hematopoiesis.

Results: 5' deletion examinations and luciferase reporter gene studies indicated that a 492 bp sequence upstream of the transcription start site is essential for transcriptional activity by the MTG16 promoter. The TATA-and CCAAT-less promoter with a GC box close to the start site showed strong reporter activity when examined in erythroid/megakaryocytic cells. Mutation of an evolutionary conserved GATA -301 consensus binding site repressed promoter function. Furthermore, results from in vitro antibody-enhanced electrophoretic mobility shift assay and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated binding of GATA-1 to the GATA -301 site. A role of GATA-1 was also supported by transfection of small interfering RNA, which diminished MTG16 expression. Furthermore, expression of the transcription factor HERP2, which represses GATA-1, produced strong inhibition of the MTG16 promoter reporter consistent with a role of GATA-1 in transcriptional activation. The TATA-less and CCAAT-less MTGR1 promoter retained most of the transcriptional activity within a -308 to -207 bp region with a GC-box-rich sequence containing multiple SP1 binding sites reminiscent of a housekeeping gene with constitutive expression. However, mutations of individual SP1 binding sites did not repress promoter function; multiple active SP1 binding sites may be required to safeguard constitutive MTGR1 transcriptional activity. The observed repression of MTG16/MTGR1 promoters by the leukemia associated AML1-ETO fusion gene may have a role in hematopoietic dysfunction of leukemia.

Conclusions: An evolutionary conserved GATA binding site is critical in transcriptional regulation of the MTG16 promoter. In contrast, the MTGR1 gene depends on a GC-box-rich sequence for transcriptional regulation and possible ubiquitous expression. Our results demonstrate that the ETO homologue promoters are regulated differently consistent with hematopoietic cell-type-specific expression and function."
Reconstructing the Demographic History of the Human Lineage Using Whole-Genome Sequences from Human and Three Great Apes,"['Hara, Y', 'Imanishi, T', 'Satta, Y']",GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/gbe/evs075,2012,10,"The demographic history of human would provide helpful information for identifying the evolutionary events that shaped the humanity but remains controversial even in the genomic era. To settle the controversies, we inferred the speciation times (T) and ancestral population sizes (N) in the lineage leading to human and great apes based on whole-genome alignment. A coalescence simulation determined the sizes of alignment blocks and intervals between them required to obtain recombination-free blocks with a high frequency. This simulation revealed that the size of the block strongly affects the parameter inference, indicating that recombination is an important factor for achieving optimum parameter inference. From the whole genome alignments (1.9 giga-bases) of human (H), chimpanzee (C), gorilla (G), and orangutan, 100-bp alignment blocks separated by >= 5-kb intervals were sampled and subjected to estimate tau=mu T and theta = 4 mu gN using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, where mu is the mutation rate and g is the generation time. Although the estimated tau(HC) differed across chromosomes, tau(HC) and tau(HCG) were strongly correlated across chromosomes, indicating that variation in tau is subject to variation in mu, rather than T, and thus, all chromosomes share a single speciation time. Subsequently, we estimated Ts of the human lineage from chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan to be 6.0-7.6, 7.6-9.7, and 15-19 Ma, respectively, assuming variable mu across lineages and chromosomes. These speciation times were consistent with the fossil records. We conclude that the speciation times in our recombination-free analysis would be conclusive and the speciation between human and chimpanzee was a single event."
Functional adaptations in the forelimb muscles of non-human great apes,"['Myatt, JP', 'Crompton, RH', 'Payne-Davis, RC', 'Vereecke, EE', 'Isler, K', 'Savage, R', ""D'Aout, K"", 'Gunther, MM', 'Thorpe, SKS']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2011.01443.x,JAN 2012,10,"The maximum capability of a muscle can be estimated from simple measurements of muscle architecture such as muscle belly mass, fascicle length and physiological cross-sectional area. While the hindlimb anatomy of the non-human apes has been studied in some detail, a comparative study of the forelimb architecture across a number of species has never been undertaken. Here we present data from chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and an orangutan to ascertain if, and where, there are functional differences relating to their different locomotor repertoires and habitat usage. We employed a combination of analyses including allometric scaling and ancovas to explore the data, as the sample size was relatively small and heterogeneous (specimens of different sizes, ages and sex). Overall, subject to possible unidentified, confounding factors such as age effects, it appears that the non-human great apes in this sample (the largest assembled to date) do not vary greatly across different muscle architecture parameters, even though they perform different locomotor behaviours at different frequencies. Therefore, it currently appears that the time spent performing a particular behaviour does not necessarily impose a dominating selective influence on the soft-tissue portion of the musculoskeletal system; rather, the overall consistency of muscle architectural properties both between and within the Asian and African apes strengthens the case for the hypothesis of a possible ancient shared evolutionary origin for orthogrady under compressive and/or suspensory loading in the great apes."
A New Isolation with Migration Model along Complete Genomes Infers Very Different Divergence Processes among Closely Related Great Ape Species,"['Mailund, T', 'Halager, AE', 'Westergaard, M', 'Dutheil, JY', 'Munch, K', 'Andersen, LN', 'Lunter, G', 'Prufer, K', 'Scally, A', 'Hobolth, A', 'Schierup, MH']",PLOS GENETICS,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003125,DEC 2012,28,"We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) for inferring gradual isolation between two populations during speciation, modelled as a time interval with restricted gene flow. The HMM describes the history of adjacent nucleotides in two genomic sequences, such that the nucleotides can be separated by recombination, can migrate between populations, or can coalesce at variable time points, all dependent on the parameters of the model, which are the effective population sizes, splitting times, recombination rate, and migration rate. We show by extensive simulations that the HMM can accurately infer all parameters except the recombination rate, which is biased downwards. Inference is robust to variation in the mutation rate and the recombination rate over the sequence and also robust to unknown phase of genomes unless they are very closely related. We provide a test for whether divergence is gradual or instantaneous, and we apply the model to three key divergence processes in great apes: (a) the bonobo and common chimpanzee, (b) the eastern and western gorilla, and (c) the Sumatran and Bornean orang-utan. We find that the bonobo and chimpanzee appear to have undergone a clear split, whereas the divergence processes of the gorilla and orang-utan species occurred over several hundred thousands years with gene flow stopping quite recently. We also apply the model to the Homo/Pan speciation event and find that the most likely scenario involves an extended period of gene flow during speciation."
Seasonal Effects on Great Ape Health: A Case Study of Wild Chimpanzees and Western Gorillas,"['Masi, S', 'Chauffour, S', 'Bain, O', 'Todd, A', 'Guillot, J', 'Krief, S']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0049805,DEC 5 2012,10,"Among factors affecting animal health, environmental influences may directly or indirectly impact host nutritional condition, fecundity, and their degree of parasitism. Our closest relatives, the great apes, are all endangered and particularly sensitive to infectious diseases. Both chimpanzees and western gorillas experience large seasonal variations in fruit availability but only western gorillas accordingly show large changes in their degree of frugivory. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare factors affecting health (through records of clinical signs, urine, and faecal samples) of habituated wild ape populations: a community (N = 46 individuals) of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Kanyawara, Kibale National Park (Uganda), and a western gorilla (G. gorilla) group (N = 13) in Bai Hokou in the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park (Central African Republic). Ape health monitoring was carried out in the wet and dry seasons (chimpanzees: July-December 2006; gorillas: April-July 2008 and December 2008-February 2009). Compared to chimpanzees, western gorillas were shown to have marginally greater parasite diversity, higher prevalence and intensity of both parasite and urine infections, and lower occurrence of diarrhea and wounds. Parasite infections (prevalence and load), but not abnormal urine parameters, were significantly higher during the dry season of the study period for western gorillas, who thus appeared more affected by the large temporal changes in the environment in comparison to chimpanzees. Infant gorillas were the most susceptible among all the age/sex classes (of both apes) having much more intense infections and urine blood concentrations, again during the dry season. Long term studies are needed to confirm the influence of seasonal factors on health and parasitism of these great apes. However, this study suggest climate change and forest fragmentation leading to potentially larger seasonal fluctuations of the environment may affect patterns of ape parasitism and further exacerbate health impacts on great ape populations that live in highly seasonal habitats."
Temporal Patterns of Nucleotide Misincorporations and DNA Fragmentation in Ancient DNA,"['Sawyer, S', 'Krause, J', 'Guschanski, K', 'Savolainen, V', 'Paabo, S']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0034131,MAR 30 2012,59,"DNA that survives in museum specimens, bones and other tissues recovered by archaeologists is invariably fragmented and chemically modified. The extent to which such modifications accumulate over time is largely unknown but could potentially be used to differentiate between endogenous old DNA and present-day DNA contaminating specimens and experiments. Here we examine mitochondrial DNA sequences from tissue remains that vary in age between 18 and 60,000 years with respect to three molecular features: fragment length, base composition at strand breaks, and apparent C to T substitutions. We find that fragment length does not decrease consistently over time and that strand breaks occur preferentially before purine residues by what may be at least two different molecular mechanisms that are not yet understood. In contrast, the frequency of apparent C to T substitutions towards the 5'-ends of molecules tends to increase over time. These nucleotide misincorporations are thus a useful tool to distinguish recent from ancient DNA sources in specimens that have not been subjected to unusual or harsh treatments."
Y-Chromosome Variation in Hominids: Intraspecific Variation Is Limited to the Polygamous Chimpanzee,"['Greve, G', 'Alechine, E', 'Pasantes, JJ', 'Hodler, C', 'Rietschel, W', 'Robinson, TJ', 'Schempp, W']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0029311,DEC 27 2011,1,"Background: We have previously demonstrated that the Y-specific ampliconic fertility genes DAZ (deleted in azoospermia) and CDY (chromodomain protein Y) varied with respect to copy number and position among chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). In comparison, seven Y-chromosomal lineages of the bonobo (Pan paniscus), the chimpanzee's closest living relative, showed no variation. We extend our earlier comparative investigation to include an analysis of the intraspecific variation of these genes in gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), and examine the resulting patterns in the light of the species' markedly different social and mating behaviors.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis (FISH) of DAZ and CDY in 12 Y-chromosomal lineages of western lowland gorilla (G. gorilla gorilla) and a single lineage of the eastern lowland gorilla (G. beringei graueri) showed no variation among lineages. Similar findings were noted for the 10 Y-chromosomal lineages examined in the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), and 11 Y-chromosomal lineages of the Sumatran orangutan (P. abelii). We validated the contrasting DAZ and CDY patterns using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in chimpanzee and bonobo.

Conclusion/Significance: High intraspecific variation in copy number and position of the DAZ and CDY genes is seen only in the chimpanzee. We hypothesize that this is best explained by sperm competition that results in the variant DAZ and CDY haplotypes detected in this species. In contrast, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans-species that are not subject to sperm competition-showed no intraspecific variation in DAZ and CDY suggesting that monoandry in gorillas, and preferential female mate choice in bonobos and orangutans, probably permitted the fixation of a single Y variant in each taxon. These data support the notion that the evolutionary history of a primate Y chromosome is not simply encrypted in its DNA sequences, but is also shaped by the social and behavioral circumstances under which the specific species has evolved."
Nutritional geometry: gorillas prioritize non-protein energy while consuming surplus protein,"['Rothman, JM', 'Raubenheimer, D', 'Chapman, CA']",BIOLOGY LETTERS,10.1098/rsbl.2011.0321,DEC 23 2011,47,"It is widely assumed that terrestrial food webs are built on a nitrogen-limited base and consequently herbivores must compensate through selection of high-protein foods and efficient nitrogen retention. Like many folivorous primates, gorillas' diet selection supports this assumption, as they apparently prefer protein-rich foods. Our study of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) in Uganda revealed that, in some periods, carbohydrate-rich fruits displace a large portion of protein-rich leaves in their diet. We show that non-protein energy (NPE) intake was invariant throughout the year, whereas protein intake was substantially higher when leaves were the major portion of the diet. This pattern of macronutrient intake suggests that gorillas prioritize NPE and, to achieve this when leaves are the major dietary item, they over-eat protein. The concentrations of protein consumed in relation to energy when leaves were the major portion of the diet were close to the maximum recommended for humans and similar to high-protein human weight-loss diets. By contrast, the concentrations of protein in relation to energy when gorillas ate fruit-dominated diets were similar to those recommended for humans. Our results question the generality of nitrogen limitation in terrestrial herbivores and provide a fascinating contrast with human macronutrient intake."
Consequences of Non-Intervention for Infectious Disease in African Great Apes,"['Ryan, SJ', 'Walsh, PD']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0029030,DEC 22 2011,26,"Infectious disease has recently joined poaching and habitat loss as a major threat to African apes. Both ""naturally"" occurring pathogens, such as Ebola and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), and respiratory pathogens transmitted from humans, have been confirmed as important sources of mortality in wild gorillas and chimpanzees. While awareness of the threat has increased, interventions such as vaccination and treatment remain controversial. Here we explore both the risk of disease to African apes, and the status of potential responses. Through synthesis of published data, we summarize prior disease impact on African apes. We then use a simple demographic model to illustrate the resilience of a well-known gorilla population to disease, modeled on prior documented outbreaks. We found that the predicted recovery time for this specific gorilla population from a single outbreak ranged from 5 years for a low mortality (4%) respiratory outbreak, to 131 years for an Ebola outbreak that killed 96% of the population. This shows that mortality rates comparable to those recently reported for disease outbreaks in wild populations are not sustainable. This is particularly troubling given the rising pathogen risk created by increasing habituation of wild apes for tourism, and the growth of human populations surrounding protected areas. We assess potential future disease spillover risk in terms of vaccination rates amongst humans that may come into contact with wild apes, and the availability of vaccines against potentially threatening diseases. We discuss and evaluate non-interventionist responses such as limiting tourist access to apes, community health programs, and safety, logistic, and cost issues that constrain the potential of vaccination."
Great Apes' Risk-Taking Strategies in a Decision Making Task,"['Haun, DBM', 'Nawroth, C', 'Call, J']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0028801,DEC 21 2011,21,"We investigate decision-making behaviour in all four non-human great ape species. Apes chose between a safe and a risky option across trials of varying expected values. All species chose the safe option more often with decreasing probability of success. While all species were risk-seeking, orangutans and chimpanzees chose the risky option more often than gorillas and bonobos. Hence all four species' preferences were ordered in a manner consistent with normative dictates of expected value, but varied predictably in their willingness to take risks."
The visual strategy specific to humans among hominids: A study using the gap-overlap paradigm,"['Kano, F', 'Hirata, S', 'Call, J', 'Tomonaga, M']",VISION RESEARCH,10.1016/j.visres.2011.09.006,DEC 8 2011,11,"Although an extensive body of literature exists on the cognitive underpinnings of gaze movements in macaques and humans, few studies have investigated this topic from a broader evolutionary perspective. This study used the gap-overlap paradigm to examine the timing of the gaze movements by four hominid species: humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The saccade latency involved in shifting the gaze from central to peripheral stimuli was measured and compared under two conditions, gap and overlap. The central stimulus disappeared shortly before the onset of the peripheral stimulus under the gap condition, but it remained under the overlap condition. Although all species demonstrated similar saccade latencies under the gap condition, the species clearly differed from one another under the overlap condition, which may suggest their similar perceptual and motor mechanism of making a saccade on the one hand and their differential strategies for coping with the competition between two activities involving fixation and initiation of a saccade (i.e. central vs. peripheral visual stimuli) on the other hand. In particular, humans showed longer saccade latency under the overlap condition compared to the other great apes, which may reflect this species' unique means of visual processing.

ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS OF CAPTIVE WESTERN LOWLAND GORILLAS (GORILLA GORILLA GORILLA),"['Murphy, HW', 'Dennis, P', 'Devlin, W', 'Meehan, T', 'Kutinsky, I']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,DEC 2011,9,"A total of 163 echocardiographic studies on western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) were submitted for evaluation; 140 from 99 animals were suitable for analysis. Of these, 81 studies (42 studies from 35 males ranging in age from 11-41+ yr and 39 studies from 31 females ranging in age from 11-41+ yr) are reported here. Three studies from 3 females and 56 studies from 30 males were excluded from this report due to cardiac abnormalities. Cardiac parameters measured were aortic root (Ao Rt) diameter and left atrial (L atrium) size. Left ventricular (LV) measurements included left ventricular internal diameter in systole (LVID(s)) and diastole (LVID(d)) as well as diastolic septal (IVS) and posterior wall thickness (LVPW). Values considered to be normal in females >11 yr of age were: Ao Rt < 3.5 cm, L atrium < 4.0 cm, LVID(d) < 5.0 cm, IVS < 1.4 cm, LVPW < 1.4 cm, and ejection fraction (EF) >60%. The data from male gorillas show a separation in animals based on three cardiac parameters: systolic function, LV cavity size, and LV wall thickness. Male gorillas >11 yr of age fall into two groups; unaffected and affected. Unaffected animals are defined as those with no echocardiographic abnormalities and a consistent Ao Rt of <4.0 cm, LVID(d) of <6.0 cm, IVS and LVPW of <1.5 cm, and an EF of >58%. The affected group consisted of male gorillas that exhibited changes in echocardiographic parameters representing the presence of cardiovascular disease. The results determined in this database, gathered from data collected from 1999-2009, suggest a sex-based difference between males and females with predominantly males demonstrating evidence of cardiac disease. The most striking finding seen in this study is that of progressive LV hypertrophy and depressed LV EF in affected adult male gorillas."
Lifetime Reproductive Success of Female Mountain Gorillas,"['Robbins, AM', 'Stoinski, T', 'Fawcett, K', 'Robbins, MM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21605,DEC 2011,13,"Studies of lifetime reproductive success (LRS) are important for understanding population dynamics and life history strategies, yet relatively little information is available for long-lived species. This study provides a preliminary assessment of LRS among female mountain gorillas in the Virunga volcanoes region. Adult females produced an average of 3.6 +/- 2.1 surviving offspring during their lifetime, which indicates a growing population that contrasts with most other great apes. The standardized variance in LRS (variance/mean(2) = 0.34) was lower than many other mammals and birds. When we excluded the most apparent source of environmental variability (poaching), the average LRS increased to 4.3 +/- 1.8 and the standardized variance dropped in half. Adult lifespan was a greater source of variance in LRS than fertility or offspring survival. Females with higher LRS had significantly longer adult lifespans and higher dominance ranks.

A Revised Timeline for the Origin of Plasmodium falciparum as a Human Pathogen,"['Baron, JM', 'Higgins, JM', 'Dzik, WH']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-011-9476-x,DEC 2011,7,"While Plasmodium falciparum is known to have had a strong effect on human evolution, the time period when P. falciparum first infected ancestors of modern humans has remained uncertain. Recent advances demonstrated that P. falciparum evolved from ancestors of gorilla parasites via host switching. Here, we estimate the range of dates during which this host switch may have occurred. DNA sequences of portions of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene obtained from gorilla parasites closely related to human P. falciparum were aligned and compared against similar sequences from human P. falciparum. Time estimates were calculated by applying a previously established parasite cytochrome b gene mutation rate (0.012 mutations per site per million years) and by modeling uncertainty in a Monte-Carlo simulation. We estimate a 95% confidence interval for when P. falciparum first infected ancestors of modern humans to be 112,000 and 1,036,000 years ago (median estimate, 365,000 years ago). This confidence interval suggests that P. falciparum first infected human ancestors much more recently than the previous recognized estimate of 2.5 million years ago. The revised estimate may inform our understanding of certain aspects of human-malaria co-evolution. For example, this revised date suggests a closer relationship between the entry of P. falciparum in humans and the appearance of many red blood cell polymorphisms considered to be genetic adaptations to malaria. In addition, the confidence interval lies within the timeframe dating the dawn of Homo sapiens, suggesting that P. falciparum may have undergone host switching as a Plasmodia adaptation specific for our species."
Identification of a Novel Allosteric Binding Site in the CXCR2 Chemokine Receptor,"['de Kruijf, P', 'Lim, HD', 'Roumen, L', 'Renjaan, VA', 'Zhao, JQ', 'Webb, ML', 'Auld, DS', 'Wijkmans, JCHM', 'Zaman, GJR', 'Smit, MJ', 'de Graaf, C', 'Leurs, R']",MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY,10.1124/mol.111.073825,DEC 2011,16,"We have shown previously that different chemical classes of small-molecule antagonists of the human chemokine CXCR2 receptor interact with distinct binding sites of the receptor. Although an intracellular binding site for diarylurea CXCR2 antagonists, such as N-(2-bromophenyl)-N'-(7-cyano-1H-benzotriazol-4-yl) urea (SB265610), and thiazolopyrimidine compounds was recently mapped by mutagenesis studies, we now report on an imidazolylpyrimidine antagonist binding pocket in the transmembrane domain of CXCR2. Using different CXCR2 orthologs, chimeric proteins, site-directed mutagenesis, and in silico modeling, we have elucidated the binding mode of this antagonist. Our in silico-guided mutagenesis studies indicate that the ligand binding cavity for imidazolylpyrimidine compounds in CXCR2 is located between transmembrane (TM) helices 3 (Phe130(3.36)), 5 (Ser217(5.44), Phe220(5.47)), and 6 (Asn268(6.52), Leu271(6.55)) and suggest that these antagonists enter CXCR2 via the TM5-TM6 interface. It is noteworthy that the same interface is postulated as the ligand entry channel in the opsin receptor and is occupied by lipid molecules in the recently solved crystal structure of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, suggesting a general ligand entrance mechanism for nonpolar ligands to G protein-coupled receptors. The identification of a novel allosteric binding cavity in the TM domain of CXCR2, in addition to the previously identified intracellular binding site, shows the diversity in ligand recognition mechanisms by this receptor and offers new opportunities for the structure-based design of small allosteric modulators of CXCR2 in the future."
Chimpanzee problem-solving: contrasting the use of causal and arbitrary cues,"['Hanus, D', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0421-6,NOV 2011,15,"Humans are able to benefit from a causally structured problem-solving context rather than arbitrarily structured situations. In order to better understand nonhuman causal cognition, it is therefore important to isolate crucial factors that might differentiate between events that follow a purely spatial and temporal contingency and those that hold a ""true"" causal relationship. In the first of two experiments, chimpanzee subjects were required to detect a bottle containing juice from five opaque bottles of equal shape and size. In the causal condition, the juice bottle looked identical to the other four bottles, only it was much heavier than the others. In the arbitrary condition, the weight of all five bottles was identical, but the juice bottle was color-marked differently. Since bottle opening was made difficult (and therefore costly), the question was whether subject's manipulative behavior would be random or somehow influenced by the nature of the provided information. Our results show that subjects detected and opened the juice bottle significantly faster when weight was the discriminating feature (causal condition) compared to situations in which the discrimination was necessarily based on a color-cue (arbitrary condition). Experiment 2 ruled out the possibility of a general learning bias toward tactile rather than visual information in chimpanzees. When tested in a simple exchange paradigm that prevented any use of causal information, no predominance of a tactile cue (weight) over a visual cue (color) could be found. Further-more-and in contrast to the causal condition in Experiment 1-no learning occurred during the course of Experiment 2, neither in the weight nor in the color condition. We therefore conclude that chimpanzees can more easily determine the content of an object based on its causal properties compared to situations in which the only available information is a pure arbitrary regularity. This supports the view that chimpanzees' causal cognition does not rely on mere perceptual information but also on structural abstraction about their physical environment."
Target animacy influences gorilla handedness,"['Forrester, GS', 'Leavens, DA', 'Quaresmini, C', 'Vallortigara, G']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0413-6,NOV 2011,25,"We investigated the unimanual actions of a biological family group of twelve western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) using a methodological approach designed to assess behavior within social context from a bottom-up perspective. Measures of both the lateralization of unimanual actions (left, right) and the target of the action (animate, inanimate) were assessed during dual, synchronized video observations of naturalistic behavior. This paper demonstrates a corelationship between handedness and the animate quality of the target object. Analyses demonstrated a significant interaction between lateralized unimanual actions and target animacy and a right-hand bias for actions directed toward inanimate targets. We suggest that lateralized motor preference reflects the different processing capabilities of the left and right hemispheres, as influenced by the emotive (animate) and/or functional (inanimate) characteristics of the target, respectively."
"The Limits of Endowment Effects in Great Apes (Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus)","['Kanngiesser, P', 'Santos, LR', 'Hood, BM', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0024516,NOV 2011,7,"The endowment effect describes the bias that people often value things that they possess more than things they do not possess. Thus, they are often reluctant to trade items in their possession for items of equivalent value. Some nonhuman primates appear to share this bias with humans, but it remains an open question whether they show endowment effects to the same extent as humans do. We investigated endowment effects in all four great ape species (Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus) by varying whether apes were endowed with food items (Experiment 1, N = 22) or tools that were instrumental in retrieving food (Experiment 2, N = 23). We first assessed apes' preferences for items of a pair and their willingness to trade items in their possession. We then endowed apes with one item of a pair and offered them to trade for the other item. Apes showed endowment effects for food, but not for tools. In Experiment 3, we endowed bonobos (N = 4) and orangutans (N = 5) with either one or 12 food items. Endowment effects did not differ between species and were not influenced by the number of endowed food items. Our findings suggest that endowment effects in great apes are restricted to immediate food gratification and remain unaffected by the quantity of food rewards. However, endowment effects do not seem to extend to other, nonconsumable possessions even when they are instrumental in retrieving food. In general, apes do not show endowment effects across a range of different commodities as humans typically do."
EVIDENCE OF TERRESTRIAL DIETS IN PLIOCENE EURASIAN PAPIONINS (MAMMALIA: PRIMATES) INFERRED FROM LOW-MAGNIFICATION STEREOMICROSCOPY OF MOLAR ENAMEL USE-WEAR SCARS,"['Williams, FL', 'Holmes, NA', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFRICANUS']",PALAIOS,10.2110/palo.2010.p10-139r,NOV-DEC 2011,1,"Pliocene papionin monkeys of Eurasia, such as Paradolichopithecus arvernensis, Procynocephalus subhimalayanus, and Macaca sp. indet. from Yushe, are large-bodied and interpreted as at least partly terrestrial. Terrestriality in primates has implications for the dietary items consumed. Dietary proclivities from the evaluation of pit and scratch counts under low-magnification (35X) were inferred to address whether the diets of these Eurasian papionins differ and whether they correspond to extant primates (Papio ursinus, n = 24, Pan troglodytes, n = 9, and Gorilla gorilla, n = 10), three Plio-Pleistocene southern African fossil papionins with known isotopic values (Parapapio broomi, n = 14; Papio robinsoni, n = 10; Theropithecus oswaldi danieli, n = 8), or a Pliocene bipedal hominin (Australopithecus africanus, n = 8). Macaca sp. indet. from Yushe most closely resembles Australopithecus africanus from South Africa, which is characterized by evidence of some hard-object feeding. Paradolichopithecus from Romania and to a lesser extent Procynocephalus from northern India also exhibit use-wear scars associated with the ingestion of grit possibly associated with the exploitation of corms and bulbs of CAM or C(4) plants. The dental microwear signal of grassland foraging typical of such C(4) grazers as Theropithecus oswaldi danieli does not characterize other Plio-Pleistocene papionins. Pliocene papionin diets converge with those of Australopithecus, suggesting that global climate cooling intensifying during the Pliocene may have led both early baboon-like monkeys and australopiths to increase consumption of nutrient-rich edible plant storage organs in these fragmented and partially open habitats of the temperate Old World."
Postoccupancy evaluations in zoological settings,"['Kelling, AS', 'Gaalema, DE']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20398,NOV-DEC 2011,3,"A postoccupancy evaluation (POE) is a systematic assessment performed to examine the effectiveness of the built environment after occupation. Although POEs have been mainly used to examine the effectiveness of built environments for human usage, they can and should be adapted for use in zoological settings. Zoological exhibits have evolved from when hygiene concerns ruled design to current trends that involve elaborate exhibits that often cost millions of dollars. Thus, it is imperative to conduct evaluations to ensure that these exhibits function to meet the complex needs of all users. It is crucial to perform a comprehensive POE that focuses on all three user groups; animals, visitors, and staff. However, work in this field is limited. Animal research has tended to remain very primate-focused with differing opinions as to what constitutes optimal outcomes. Zoo visitor studies often have limited scope and differing methodologies. Additionally, research on zoo staff opinions and feedback is almost nonexistent. A new exhibit opening at a zoo has huge potential for improving the welfare of the animals it will house, enhancing the zoo visitor experience, and improving the workplace for zoo personnel. Building the best possible exhibits requires not only the analysis of how the built environment affects all three groups, but also dissemination of those findings to guide future design.

Functional Anatomy and Adaptation of Male Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) with Comparison to Male Orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus),"['Zihlman, AL', 'McFarland, RK', 'Underwood, CE']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.21449,NOV 2011,10,"Great apes diversified during the Miocene in Old World forests. Two lineages, gorillas in Africa and orangutans in Asia, have sexual dimorphisms of super-sized males, though they presumably diverged from a smaller common ancestor. We test the hypothesis that they increased in body mass independently and convergently, and that their many postcranial differences reflect locomotor differences. Whole body dissections of five adult male gorillas and four adult male orangutans allowed quantification of body mass distribution to limb segments, of body composition (muscle, bone, skin, and fat relative to total body mass), and of muscle distribution and proportions. Results demonstrate that gorilla forelimb anatomy accommodates shoulder joint mobility for vertical climbing and reaching while maintaining joint stability during quadrupedal locomotion. The heavily muscled hind limbs are equipped for propulsion and weight-bearing over relatively stable substrates on the forest floor. In contrast, orangutan forelimb length, muscle mass, and joint construction are modified for strength and mobility in climbing, bridging, and traveling over flexible supports through the forest canopy. Muscles of hip, knee, and ankle joints provide rotational and prehensile strength essential for moving on unstable and discontinuous branches. We conclude that anatomical similarities are due to common ancestry and that differences in postcranial anatomy reflect powerful selection for divergent locomotor adaptations. These data further support the evolutionary conclusion that gorillas fall with chimpanzees and humans as part of the African hominoid radiation; orangutans are a specialized outlier.

"Differences in gorilla nettle-feeding between captivity and the wild: local traditions, species typical behaviors or merely the result of nutritional deficiencies?","['Masi, S']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0457-7,NOV 2011,3,"Behavioral and cognitive studies on captive apes often pay little attention to the specific environmental conditions of their study subjects. A recent report form Byrne et al. (Anim Cogn doi:10.1007/s10071-011-0403-8, 2011), comparing nettle-feeding techniques between captive and wild gorillas, claimed to document ""the strongest evidence yet to come from any great ape that observational learning of a skilled conspecific"" can allow social learning and culture in gorillas. An earlier study with similar findings placed emphasis instead on the many similarities and claims for species typical behavior, thus a genetic hypothesis instead of a cultural hypothesis. This commentary aims at formulating a third environmental hypothesis based on path-dependent behavioral differences owing to different diet and availability of nutritional resources of wild and captive gorillas. Captive diet provides gorillas with a much lower concentration of fibers. Gorillas are hindgut fermenters, and this deficit of natural fermentation of fibers may impact their health and their behavior in zoos. Results of Byrne et al.'s study will be discussed comparing feeding choice and availability of nutritional resources of wild and captive gorillas, showing that in captivity gorilla, motivation to consume certain food or certain plant parts may differ drastically from that of wild gorillas. This view does not intend to deny that social learning and culture may exist in gorillas, but to guide and encourage future works investigating social learning in great apes to take more accurately into account the living conditions and, when comparing populations, the possible environmental differences."

It has been described in other primates, and it has been proposed that the species B. suis from pigs and B. struthionis from ostriches are synonyms of B. coli. Previous genetic analysis of pig and ostrich Balantidium isolates found a genetic polymorphism in the ITS region but its taxonomic relevance was not established. We have extended the genetic analysis to Balantidium isolates of pig, gorilla, human and ostrich origin. We have PCR-amplified and sequenced the ITS region of individual Balantidium cells. The predicted ITS secondary structures of the sequences obtained were transferred by homology modelling to the sequences of other Trichostomatia ciliates (Isotricha, Troglodytella, Lacrymaria and Spathidium) and compared to determine the importance of the differences in the primary sequences. The results show that the ITS2 secondary structure of the species considered follows the general pattern of other ciliates, although with some deviations. There are at least two main types of ITS sequence variants in B. coil which could be present in the same cell and they are common to the mammal and avian hosts studied. These data do not support B. suis and B. struthionis as distinct species. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier GmbH."

We found that EBOV-GP but not Vpu counteracted tetherin from different primate species, indicating that EBOV-GP and Vpu target tetherin differentially. Tetherin interacted with the GP2 subunit of EBOV-GP, which might encode the determinants for tetherin counteraction. Vpu reduced cell surface expression of tetherin while EBOV-GP did not, suggesting that both proteins employ different mechanisms to counteract tetherin. Finally, Marburg virus (MARV)-GP also inhibited tetherin and downregulated tetherin in a cell type-dependent fashion, indicating that tetherin antagonism depends on the cellular source of tetherin. Collectively, our results indicate that EBOV-GP counteracts tetherin by a novel mechanism and that tetherin inhibition is conserved between EBOV-GP and MARV-GP."

In an attempt to contribute new evidence to this debate, bootstrapping techniques are used for analyzing the cranial variability of Homo. The results indicate that: (i) the size of the neurocranium relative to the viscerocranium discriminates better among extant hominoid species than skull size; (ii) no cluster of fossil specimens of Homo exceeds the morphological variability of Gorilla gorilla, with the only exception of the one that comprises all members of Homo except modern humans; and (iii) some clusters are taxonomically more consistent than others, as long as they show a range of morphological variability similar to that found in both Pan troglodytes and Homo sapiens. According to these results, three taxa are tentatively suggested for Homo: (i) anatomically modern humans; (ii) an ""erectine"" morphotype plus Neanderthals; and (iii) a ""habiline"" cluster. Finally, the results indicate a greater taxonomic affinity for the human population involved in the first dispersal ""Out of Africa"" with the ""habiline"" group, which agrees with the early age reported for Dmanisi (1.77 Ma), a Georgian site placed at the gates of Europe.

However, our understanding of their significance is still hindered by the lack of primate CNV data. We performed intraspecific comparative genomic hybridizations to identify loci harboring copy number variants in each of the four great apes: bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. For the first time, we could analyze differences in CNV location and frequency in these four species, and compare them with human CNVs and primate segmental duplication (SD) maps. In addition, for bonobo and gorilla, patterns of CNV and nucleotide diversity were studied in the same individuals. We show that CNVs have been subject to different selective pressures in different lineages. Evidence for purifying selection is stronger in gorilla CNVs overlapping genes, while positive selection appears to have driven the fixation of structural variants in the orangutan lineage. In contrast, chimpanzees and bonobos present high levels of common structural polymorphism, which is indicative of relaxed purifying selection together with the higher mutation rates induced by the known burst of segmental duplication in the ancestor of the African apes. Indeed, the impact of the duplication burst is noticeable by the fact that bonobo and chimpanzee share more CNVs with gorilla than expected. Finally, we identified a number of interesting genomic regions that present high-frequency CNVs in all great apes, while containing only very rare or even pathogenic structural variants in humans."

We discovered and validated over 7665 structural changes within the gorilla lineage, including sequence resolution of inversions, deletions, duplications, and mobile element insertions. A comparison with human and other ape genomes shows that the gorilla genome has been subjected to the highest rate of segmental duplication. We show that both the gorilla and chimpanzee genomes have experienced independent yet convergent patterns of structural mutation that have not occurred in humans, including the formation of subtelomeric heterochromatic caps, the hyperexpansion of segmental duplications, and bursts of retroviral integrations. Our analysis suggests that the chimpanzee and gorilla genomes are structurally more derived than either orangutan or human genomes."
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT IN CAPTIVE CHIMPANZEES (Pan troglodytes spp.) AND GORILLAS (Gorilla gorilla gorilla): BEHAVIOR AND FAECAL CORTISOL LEVELS,"['Zaragoza, F', 'Ibanez, M', 'Mas, B', 'Laiglesia, S', 'Anzola, B']",REVISTA CIENTIFICA-FACULTAD DE CIENCIAS VETERINARIAS,NA,SEP-OCT 2011,0,"It is considered of significant importance to provide wild animals in captivity with environmental enrichment elements to improve their psychological and physiological well being, stimulating a higher activity and behavioral variety. This study evaluated the effect of different enrichment elements (explorative/manipulative, physical and feeding enrichment devices) on the behavior and physiology of two groups of great apes, gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at the Zoo-Aquarium of Madrid. The proposed prediction was that there would be a reduction of inactivity, anomalous and non-desired behavior, also on cortisol levels, as a result of the stimular improvements. The behaviors and cortisol faecal levels were compared between two different conditions: 1. previous phase without enrichment, 2. enrichment phase. The data analysis allowed measuring the efficiency of the enrichment, revealing that the frequency of inactivity and anomalous behaviors was significantly reduced in the enrichment phase. On the other hand, the frequency of exploratory-manipulative behavior increased in both species, whereas locomotors and feeding behaviors were reduced in gorillas but increased in chimpanzees. Also, the preferences of chimpanzees and gorillas for the diverse enrichments elements were different. In relation to the levels of cortisol, the results do not support the proposal for the initial hypothesis, both in the case of chimpanzees as in the case of gorillas, it had increased to such levels in the enrichment phase, the increase being significant just in the gorillas. The results on the behavioral parameters are consistent with the hypothesis because there is improvement induced by environmental enrichment."

Local traditions in gorilla manual skill: evidence for observational learning of behavioral organization,"['Byrne, RW', 'Hobaiter, C', 'Klailova, M']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0403-8,SEP 2011,5,"Elaborate manual skills of food processing are known in several species of great ape; but their manner of acquisition is controversial. Local, ""cultural"" traditions show the influence of social learning, but it is uncertain whether this includes the ability to imitate the organization of behavior. Dispute has centered on whether program-level imitation contributes to the acquisition of feeding techniques in gorillas. Here, we show that captive western gorillas at Port Lympne, Kent, have developed a group-wide habit of feeding on nettles, using two techniques. We compare their nettle processing behavior with that of wild mountain gorillas in Rwanda. Both populations are similar in their repertoires of action elements, and in developing multi-step techniques for food processing, with coordinated asymmetric actions of the hands and iteration of parts of a process as ""subroutines"". Crucially, however, the two populations deal in different ways with the special challenges presented by nettle stings, with consistently different organizations of action elements. We conclude that, while an elaborate repertoire of manual actions and the ability to develop complex manual skills are natural characteristics of gorillas, the inter-site differences in nettle-eating technique are best explained as a consequence of social transmission. According to this explanation, gorillas can copy aspects of program organization from the behavior of others and they use this ability when learning how to eat nettles, resulting in consistent styles of processing by most individuals at each different site; like other great apes, gorillas have the precursor abilities for developing culture."
Femoral Morphology and Femoropelvic Musculoskeletal Anatomy of Humans and Great Apes: A Comparative Virtopsy Study,"['Morimoto, N', 'De Leon, MSP', 'Nishimura, T', 'Zollikofer, CPE']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.21424,SEP 2011,7,"The proximal femoral morphology of fossil hominins is routinely interpreted in terms of muscular topography and associated locomotor modes. However, the detailed correspondence between hard and soft tissue structures in the proximal femoral region of extant great apes is relatively unknown, because dissection protocols typically do not comprise in-depth osteological descriptions. Here, we use computed tomography and virtopsy (virtual dissection) for non-invasive examination of the femoro-pelvic musculoskeletal anatomy in Pan troglodytes, P. paniscus, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, and Homo sapiens. Specifically, we analyze the topographic relationship between muscle attachment sites and surface structures of the proximal femoral shaft such as the lateral spiral pilaster. Our results show that the origin of the vastus lateralis muscle is anterior to the insertion of gluteus maximus in all examined great ape specimens and humans. In gorillas and orangutans, the insertion of gluteus maximus is on the inferior (anterolateral) side of the lateral spiral pilaster. In chimpanzees, however, the maximus insertion is on its superior (posteromedial) side, similar to the situation in modern humans. These findings support the hypothesis that chimpanzees and humans exhibit a shared-derived musculoskeletal topography of the proximal femoral region, irrespective of their different locomotor modes, whereas gorillas and orangutans represent the primitive condition. Caution is thus warranted when inferring locomotor behavior from the surface topography of the proximal femur of fossil hominins, as the morphology of this region may contain a strong phyletic signal that tends to blur locomotor adaptation.

The Magic Cup: Great Apes and Domestic Dogs (Canis familiaris) Individuate Objects According to Their Properties,"['Brauer, J', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0023009,AUG 2011,7,"Despite current interest in dog (Canis familiaris) cognition, very little is known about how dogs represent objects and how they compare with other species, such as the great apes. Therefore, we investigated how dogs and great apes (chimpanzees [Pan troglodytes], bonobos [Pan paniscus], orangutans [Pongo pygmaeus], gorillas [Gorilla gorilla]) individuate objects in a classical violation of expectation paradigm. We used a container (magic cup) with a double bottom that allowed us to change the type of food that subjects had seen being placed in the container. Using a 2 X 2 design, we varied whether subjects received a generally preferred food and whether the food was substituted (surprise trials) or not (baseline trials). Apes showed increased begging and looking behaviors and dogs showed increased smelling behavior. Both species stayed near the experimenter more frequently in the surprise trials compared with baseline trials. Both species reacted to positive (i.e., good food substituted for bad food) and negative (i.e., bad food substituted for good food) surprises. These results suggest that apes and dogs were able to individuate objects according to their properties or type in comparable ways. In addition, we looked for frustration and elation effects, but subjects' behaviors were not influenced by the food they saw and which they received in previous trials."
Hindlimb muscle architecture in non-human great apes and a comparison of methods for analysing inter-species variation,"['Myatt, JP', 'Crompton, RH', 'Thorpe, SKS']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2011.01383.x,AUG 2011,9,"By relating an animal's morphology to its functional role and the behaviours performed, we can further develop our understanding of the selective factors and constraints acting on the adaptations of great apes. Comparison of muscle architecture between different ape species, however, is difficult because only small sample sizes are ever available. Further, such samples are often comprised of different age-sex classes, so studies have to rely on scaling techniques to remove body mass differences. However, the reliability of such scaling techniques has been questioned. As datasets increase in size, more reliable statistical analysis may eventually become possible. Here we employ geometric and allometric scaling techniques, and ANCOVAs (a form of general linear model, GLM) to highlight and explore the different methods available for comparing functional morphology in the non-human great apes. Our results underline the importance of regressing data against a suitable body size variable to ascertain the relationship (geometric or allometric) and of choosing appropriate exponents by which to scale data. ANCOVA models, while likely to be more robust than scaling for species comparisons when sample sizes are high, suffer from reduced power when sample sizes are low. Therefore, until sample sizes are radically increased it is preferable to include scaling analyses along with ANCOVAs in data exploration. Overall, the results obtained from the different methods show little significant variation, whether in muscle belly mass, fascicle length or physiological cross-sectional area between the different species. This may reflect relatively close evolutionary relationships of the non-human great apes; a universal influence on morphology of generalised orthograde locomotor behaviours or, quite likely, both."
Deep trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodelling in the placental bed of the lowland gorilla,"['Pijnenborg, R', 'Vercruysse, L', 'Carter, AM']",PLACENTA,10.1016/j.placenta.2011.05.007,AUG 2011,9,"In contrast to baboon or rhesus macaque, trophoblast invasion in the human placental bed occurs by the interstitial as well as the endovascular route and reaches as deep as the inner myometrium. We here describe two rare specimens of gorilla placenta. In the light of recent findings in the chimpanzee, we postulated the occurrence of deep invasion in gorilla pregnancy. Tissues were processed for histology (PAS, orcein), lectin staining (Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1) and immunohistochemistry (cytokeratin 7/17, a-actin). A specimen of young but undetermined gestational age included deep placental bed tissue, showing interstitial and spiral artery invasion of the inner myometrium as well as the decidua. The cell density and depth of trophoblast invasion was equivalent to a human placental bed of 10-14 weeks. Intraluminal trophoblasts were not seen in any of the invaded vessels, allowing no definite conclusions about the origin of the intramural trophoblast and the time-course of spiral artery invasion. A different late second trimester placenta specimen showed scattered extravillous trophoblast in the basal plate and underlying decidua, as well as a remodelled spiral artery containing intramural trophoblast. Absence of inner myometrial tissue precluded assessment of invasion depth in this later specimen. Despite the limited material we can conclude that key aspects of trophoblast invasion are shared by the three hominid species: gorilla, chimpanzee and human. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, human monoclonal antibody technology was used to assign human ABO blood groups to whole blood samples from great apes housed in North American and European zoos and in situ managed populations, as a practical means to assist blood transfusion situations for these species. From a subset of each of the species (bonobo, common chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutans), DNA sequence analysis was performed to determine blood group genotype. Bonobo and common chimpanzee populations were predominantly group A, which concurred with historic literature and was confirmed by genotyping. In agreement with historic literature, a smaller number of the common chimpanzees sampled were group O, although this O blood group was more often present in wild-origin animals as compared with zoo-born animals. Gorilla blood groups were inconclusive by monoclonal antibody techniques, and genetic studies were inconsistent with any known human blood group. As the genus and, specifically, the Bornean species, orangutans were identified with all human blood groups, including O, which had not been reported previously. Following this study, it was concluded that blood groups of bonobo, common chimpanzees, and some orangutans can be reliably assessed by human monoclonal antibody technology. However, this technique was not reliable for gorilla or orangutans other than those with blood group A. Even in those species with reliable blood group detection, blood transfusion preparation must include cross-matching to minimize adverse reactions for the patient. Zoo Biol 30: 427-444, 2011.

Can lemurs (Eulemur fulvus and E. macaco) use abstract representations of quantities to master the reverse-reward contingency task?,"['Genty, E', 'Roeder, JJ']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-011-0245-7,JUL 2011,3,"In previous studies we demonstrated that brown and black lemurs (Eulemur fulvus and E. macaco) showed self-control abilities under a reverse-reward contingency. They were able to significantly select the smaller quantity of food to be rewarded with the larger one and to generalize this ability when presented with two rewards that differed in quality. In the present study, previously trained subjects had to choose between graphic representations of two different quantities of food under the reverse-reward contingency. Three out of four subjects learned to associate a graphic representation of the reward with the corresponding quantity. Only one subject consistently selected the representation of the smaller quantity to be rewarded with the larger quantity of food and therefore showed abstraction as well as relative numerousness skills. Indeed, she was able to discriminate between representations of different quantities and to ordinate them. We discuss how primates mentally represent food quantities and how self-control is involved in foraging strategies."
Great apes' strategies to map spatial relations,"['Hribar, A', 'Haun, D', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0385-6,JUL 2011,8,"We investigated reasoning about spatial relational similarity in three great ape species: chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans. Apes were presented with three spatial mapping tasks in which they were required to find a reward in an array of three cups, after observing a reward being hidden in a different array of three cups. To obtain a food reward, apes needed to choose the cup that was in the same relative position (i.e., on the left) as the baited cup in the other array. The three tasks differed in the constellation of the two arrays. In Experiment 1, the arrays were placed next to each other, forming a line. In Experiment 2, the positioning of the two arrays varied each trial, being placed either one behind the other in two rows, or next to each other, forming a line. Finally, in Experiment 3, the two arrays were always positioned one behind the other in two rows, but misaligned. Results suggested that apes compared the two arrays and recognized that they were similar in some way. However, we believe that instead of mapping the left-left, middle-middle, and right-right cups from each array, they mapped the cups that shared the most similar relations to nearby landmarks (table's visual boundaries)."
Dogs are able to solve a means-end task,"['Range, F', 'Hentrup, M', 'Viranyi, Z']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0394-5,JUL 2011,12,"Dogs, although very skilled in social-communicative tasks, have shown limited abilities in the domain of physical cognition. Consequently, several researchers hypothesized that domestication enhanced dogs' cognitive abilities in the social realm, but relaxed selection on the physical one. For instance, dogs failed to demonstrate means-end understanding, an important form of relying on physical causal connection, when tested in a string-pulling task. Here, we tested dogs in an ""on/off"" task using a novel approach. Thirty-two dogs were confronted with four different conditions in which they could choose between two boards one with a reward ""on"" and another one with a reward ""off"" (reward was placed next to the board). The dogs chose the correct board when (1) both rewards were placed at the same distance from the dog, when (2) the reward placed ""on"" the board was closer to the dog, and (3) even when the reward placed ""off"" the board was much closer to the dog and was food. Interestingly, in the latter case, dogs did not perform above chance, if instead of a direct reward, the dogs had to retrieve an object placed on the board to get a food reward. In contrast to previous string-pulling studies, our results show that dogs are able to solve a means-end task even if proximity of the unsupported reward is a confounding factor."
Spatial Organization of Neurons in the Frontal Pole Sets Humans Apart from Great Apes,"['Semendeferi, K', 'Teffer, K', 'Buxhoeveden, DP', 'Park, MS', 'Bludau, S', 'Amunts, K', 'Travis, K', 'Buckwalter, J']",CEREBRAL CORTEX,10.1093/cercor/bhq191,JUL 2011,64,"Few morphological differences have been identified so far that distinguish the human brain from the brains of our closest relatives, the apes. Comparative analyses of the spatial organization of cortical neurons, including minicolumns, can aid our understanding of the functionally relevant aspects of microcircuitry. We measured horizontal spacing distance and gray-level ratio in layer III of 4 regions of human and ape cortex in all 6 living hominoid species: frontal pole (Brodmann area [BA] 10), and primary motor (BA 4), primary somatosensory (BA 3), and primary visual cortex (BA 17). Our results identified significant differences between humans and apes in the frontal pole (BA 10). Within the human brain, there were also significant differences between the frontal pole and 2 of the 3 regions studied (BA 3 and BA 17). Differences between BA 10 and BA 4 were present but did not reach significance. These findings in combination with earlier findings on BA 44 and BA 45 suggest that human brain evolution was likely characterized by an increase in the number and width of minicolumns and the space available for interconnectivity between neurons in the frontal lobe, especially the prefrontal cortex."
When and How Well Can Human-Socialized Capuchins Match Actions Demonstrated by a Familiar Human?,"['Fragaszy, DM', 'Deputte, B', 'Cooper, EJ', 'Colbert-White, EN', 'Hemery, C']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20941,JUL 2011,4,"Capuchin monkeys have provided uneven evidence of matching actions they observe others perform. In accord with theories emphasizing the attentional salience of object movement and spatial relationships, we predicted that human-reared monkeys would better match events in which a human demonstrator moved an object into a new relation with another object or surface than other kinds of actions. Three human-reared capuchins were invited repeatedly by a familiar human to perform a fixed set of actions upon objects or upon their bodies, using the ""Do as I do"" procedure. Actions directed at the body were matched less reliably than actions involving objects, and actions were matched best when the monkey looked at the demonstration for at least 2 sec and performed its action within a few seconds after the demonstration. The most commonly matched actions were those that one monkey performed relatively often when the experiment began. One monkey partially reproduced three novel actions (out of 48 demonstrations), all three involving moving or placing objects, and two of which it also performed following other demonstrations. These findings contribute convergent evidence that capuchin monkeys display social facilitation of activity, enhanced interest in particular objects and emulation of spatial outcomes. This pattern can support the development of shared manipulative skills, as evident in traditions of foraging and tool use in natural settings. The findings do not suggest that human rearing substantively altered capuchins' ability or interest in matching the actions of a familiar human, although visual attention to the human demonstrator may have been greater in these monkeys than in normally reared monkeys.

The Spread of Fecally Transmitted Parasites in Socially-Structured Populations,"['Nunn, CL', 'Thrall, PH', 'Leendertz, FH', 'Boesch, C']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0021677,JUN 30 2011,13,"Mammals are infected by a wide array of gastrointestinal parasites, including parasites that also infect humans and domesticated animals. Many of these parasites are acquired through contact with infectious stages present in soil, feces or vegetation, suggesting that ranging behavior will have a major impact on their spread. We developed an individual-based spatial simulation model to investigate how range use intensity, home range overlap, and defecation rate impact the spread of fecally transmitted parasites in a population composed of social groups (i.e., a socially structured population). We also investigated the effects of epidemiological parameters involving host and parasite mortality rates, transmissibility, disease-related mortality, and group size. The model was spatially explicit and involved the spillover of a gastrointestinal parasite from a reservoir population along the edge of a simulated reserve, which was designed to mimic the introduction pathogens into protected areas. Animals ranged randomly within a ""core"" area, with biased movement toward the range center when outside the core. We systematically varied model parameters using a Latin hypercube sampling design. Analyses of simulation output revealed a strong positive association between range use intensity and the prevalence of infection. Moreover, the effects of range use intensity were similar in magnitude to effects of group size, mortality rates, and the per-contact probability of transmission. Defecation rate covaried positively with gastrointestinal parasite prevalence. Greater home range overlap had no positive effects on prevalence, with a smaller core resulting in less range overlap yet more intensive use of the home range and higher prevalence. Collectively, our results reveal that parasites with fecal-oral transmission spread effectively in socially structured populations. Future application should focus on parameterizing the model with empirically derived ranging behavior for different species or populations and data on transmission characteristics of different infectious organisms."
Increased RNA editing in EAAT2 pre-mRNA from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients: Involvement of a cryptic polyadenylation site,"['Flomen, R', 'Makoff, A']",NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS,10.1016/j.neulet.2011.04.047,JUN 22 2011,5,"The astroglial EAAT2 glutamate transporter is essential for clearing glutamate in the central nervous system and protecting against excitotoxicity. It is implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, the most common type of motor neurone disease) where less EAAT2 is found, possibly involving aberrant intron 7 retention transcripts. We report adenine/inosine RNA editing at a novel site in intron 7 of EAAT2 pre-mRNA that appears to activate a cryptic alternative polyadenylation site, generating intron 7 retention transcripts. This polyadenylation site includes two overlapping polyadenylation signals opposite the editing site in a strong stem-loop, which is highly conserved in primates. In pre-mRNA, we observed variable editing levels at this site, which were significantly higher in spinal cord (p = 0.001) and motor cortex (p = 0.005) from ALS patients, but not in cerebellum, demonstrating specificity for clinically relevant regions. By contrast, incomplete mRNA molecules polyadenylated in intron 7 are always completely edited. Cell culture experiments confirm this strong correlation between editing and polyadenylation in intron 7, strongly suggesting activation of the alternative polyadenylation site by editing. Prediction of inosine base-pairing from published data suggests that RNA editing releases the polyadenylation signals from the stem-loop, providing a plausible mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of RNA editing activating an alternative polyadenylation signal. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
Human and great ape red blood cells differ in plasmalogen levels and composition,"['Moser, AB', 'Steinberg, SJ', 'Watkins, PA', 'Moser, HW', 'Ramaswamy, K', 'Siegmund, KD', 'Lee, DR', 'Ely, JJ', 'Ryder, OA', 'Hacia, JG']",LIPIDS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE,10.1186/1476-511X-10-101,JUN 17 2011,9,"Background: Plasmalogens are ether phospholipids required for normal mammalian developmental, physiological, and cognitive functions. They have been proposed to act as membrane antioxidants and reservoirs of polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as influence intracellular signaling and membrane dynamics. Plasmalogens are particularly enriched in cells and tissues of the human nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems. Humans with severely reduced plasmalogen levels have reduced life spans, abnormal neurological development, skeletal dysplasia, impaired respiration, and cataracts. Plasmalogen deficiency is also found in the brain tissue of individuals with Alzheimer disease.

Results: In a human and great ape cohort, we measured the red blood cell (RBC) levels of the most abundant types of plasmalogens. Total RBC plasmalogen levels were lower in humans than bonobos, chimpanzees, and gorillas, but higher than orangutans. There were especially pronounced cross-species differences in the levels of plasmalogens with a C16:0 moiety at the sn-1 position. Humans on Western or vegan diets had comparable total RBC plasmalogen levels, but the latter group showed moderately higher levels of plasmalogens with a C18:1 moiety at the sn-1 position. We did not find robust sex-specific differences in human or chimpanzee RBC plasmalogen levels or composition. Furthermore, human and great ape skin fibroblasts showed only modest differences in peroxisomal plasmalogen biosynthetic activity. Human and chimpanzee microarray data indicated that genes involved in plasmalogen biosynthesis show cross-species differential expression in multiple tissues.

Conclusion: We propose that the observed differences in human and great ape RBC plasmalogens are primarily caused by their rates of biosynthesis and/or turnover. Gene expression data raise the possibility that other human and great ape cells and tissues differ in plasmalogen levels. Based on the phenotypes of humans and rodents with plasmalogen disorders, we propose that cross-species differences in tissue plasmalogen levels could influence organ functions and processes ranging from cognition to reproduction to aging."

In order to better understand the cognitive demands of the task, we further tested other populations of chimpanzees and orangutans with the variation of the peanut initially floating or not. Twenty percent of the chimpanzees but none of the orangutans were successful. Additional controls revealed that successful subjects added water only if it was necessary to obtain the nut. Another experiment was conducted to investigate the reason for the differences in performance between the unsuccessful (Experiment 1) and the successful (Experiment 2) chimpanzee populations. We found suggestive evidence for the view that functional fixedness might have impaired the chimpanzees' strategies in the first experiment. Finally, we tested how human children of different age classes perform in an analogous experimental setting. Within the oldest group (8 years), 58 percent of the children solved the problem, whereas in the youngest group (4 years), only 8 percent were able to find the solution."

Microsporidia were detected at all sampling sites. Sequence analyses of ITS amplicons generated by using microsporidia-specific primers determined the presence of microsporidia in 87 samples including 13 humans; since two cases of simultaneous occurrence of Encephalitozoon cuniculi and Enterocytozoon bieneusi were identified, 89 full-length ITS sequences were obtained, namely 78 Encephalitozoon cuniculi genotype 1, five E. cuniculi genotype II, two E. hellem 1A and four Enterocytozoon bieneusi. No Encephalitozoon intestinalis-positive samples were identified. This is the first report of Encephalitozoon species and Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotypes in captive great apes kept under various conditions and the first record of natural infection with E. hellem in great apes. A comparison of zoos and sanctuaries showed a significantly higher prevalence of microsporidia in sanctuaries (P < 0.001), raising a question about the factors affecting the occurrence of microsporidia in epidemiologically and sanitarily comparable types of facilities."

Testicular samples were obtained by autopsy or biopsy from 10 gorillas, 11 chimpanzees, and 7 orangutans from several zoos and institutes. The seminiferous epithelia were thick in the chimpanzee and orangutan but thin in the gorilla. Leydig cells in the interstitial tissue were abundant in the gorilla. The acrosomic system was extremely well developed in the orangutans. Our study reveals that the cycle of seminiferous epithelium in orangutan testis can be divided into ten stages, whereas that in human, chimpanzee, and gorilla testes can be divided into only six stages. Phylogenetic analyses of the number of divisions may indicate that the seminiferous epithelium of our common ancestor has changed since the orangutan diverged from it. Furthermore, we performed comparative analyses of testicular microstructure to estimate relative sperm production among these three animals, and proposed a new indicator (namely the spermatogenic index, SI) closely related to sperm production. The SI indicated that a chimpanzee usually produces about 223 times more sperm than a gorilla and about 14 times more than an orangutan. Our data demonstrate the significance of the SI for estimating sperm production, thus aiding our understanding of the reproductive strategy as well as testis weight and relative testis size in investigated primates.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF A WESTERN LOWLAND GORILLA (GORILLA GORILLA GORILLA) WITH A CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY DEVICE,"['Rush, EM', 'Ogburn, AL', 'Monroe, D']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,NA,JUN 2011,1,"A 24-yr-old, male western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) was diagnosed with congestive heart failure using transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiology. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III was assigned to the severity of the condition. Over 16 mo, this progressed to NYHA Class IV despite increasing medical therapy. Repeated evaluations suggested that implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy device with a defibrillator (CRT-D) could benefit this animal based on clinical signs and underlying evidence of dyssynchrony and suspected fibrotic myocardial disease. Surgical implantation of leads into the right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle was accomplished. The CRT-D device was placed under the thoracic pectoral muscles during an initial surgical procedure. Improvement in the gorilla's clinical condition after implantation of the CRT-D device was immediate and dramatic. Subsequent scanning of the device was accomplished through operant conditioning. The data from these device interrogations included stored and real-time cardiac data, which were used to minimize recognized environmental stressors and change device settings. Over 4 yr, case management was critical to successful device use in treatment of the clinical disease. This involved medications, training for device interrogation, exercise to increase activity and improve body condition, and phlebotomy attempts. Dietary management was necessary to manipulate caloric and sodium intake and encourage medication compliance. Cardiac resynchronization therapy device implantation, although requiring specialized equipment and surgical skill, appears to be a viable option for treatment of fibrosing cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction in gorillas refractory to medical management. In addition to treatment, this device provides cardiovascular data at rest that could allow for early diagnosis and treatment of gorillas with this and other cardiac conditions in the future. This describes the comprehensive medical, husbandry, and training techniques necessary to successfully manage this intense clinical case in conjunction with intracardiac device therapy."
Strategies for the Use of Fallback Foods in Apes,"['Harrison, ME', 'Marshall, AJ']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-010-9487-2,JUN 2011,28,"Researchers have suggested that fallback foods (FBFs) shape primate food processing adaptations, whereas preferred foods drive harvesting adaptations, and that the dietary importance of FBFs is central in determining the expression of a variety of traits. We examine these hypotheses in extant apes. First, we compare the nature and dietary importance of FBFs used by each taxon. FBF importance appears greatest in gorillas, followed by chimpanzees and siamangs, and least in orangutans and gibbons (bonobos are difficult to place). Next, we compare 20 traits among taxa to assess whether the relative expression of traits expected for consumption of FBFs matches their observed dietary importance. Trait manifestation generally conforms to predictions based on dietary importance of FBFs. However, some departures from predictions exist, particularly for orang-utans, which express relatively more food harvesting and processing traits predicted for consuming large amounts of FBFs than expected based on observed dietary importance. This is probably due to the chemical, mechanical, and phenological properties of the apes' main FBFs, in particular high importance of figs for chimpanzees and hylobatids, compared to use of bark and leaves-plus figs in at least some Sumatran populations-by orang-utans. This may have permitted more specialized harvesting adaptations in chimpanzees and hylobatids, and required enhanced processing adaptations in orang-utans. Possible intercontinental differences in the availability and quality of preferred and FBFs may also be important. Our analysis supports previous hypotheses suggesting a critical influence of the dietary importance and quality of FBFs on ape ecology and, consequently, evolution."
"Sympatric Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Loango National Park, Gabon: Dietary Composition, Seasonality, and Intersite Comparisons","['Head, JS', 'Boesch, C', 'Makaga, L', 'Robbins, MM']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-011-9499-6,JUN 2011,22,"Dietary overlap of sympatric apes is complex and understudied, but its examination is essential to further our understanding of species distribution, abundance, and community ecology. Over 3 yr we studied food availability and dietary composition of central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Loango National Park, Gabon. We predicted that living in a habitat dominated by mature forest with sparse terrestrial herbaceous vegetation would lead to an increase in frugivory by gorillas, resulting in increased dietary overlap between the 2 ape species vs. other sites, but that chimpanzees would remain more frugivorous than gorillas. Through fecal analysis we measured overlap in fruit consumption between the 2 species on a bimonthly basis using the Renkonens method. Mean overlap was 27.5% but varied greatly seasonally, ranging between 0.3% and 69%, indicating that when examined on a finer scale, the degree of overlap appears much lower than at other study sites. In contrast to studies elsewhere, there was not a positive correlation between rainfall and fruit availability in Loango, and the long dry season was a period of high fruit production. As observed elsewhere, we found a positive correlation between fruit consumption and fruit availability for both chimpanzees and gorillas and we found that chimpanzees were more frugivorous than gorillas. A very low availability of herbs did not lead to increased frugivory by gorillas nor increased overlap between the 2 ape species vs. other field sites. We conclude that forest composition, fruit availability, and dietary variability of sympatric species can vary greatly between locations, and that chimpanzees and gorillas can adapt to primary forest with little undergrowth, where they concentrate their diet on fruit and leaves."
Physical Intuitions About Support Relations in Monkeys (Macaca fuscata) and Apes (Pan troglodytes),"['Murai, C', 'Tanaka, M', 'Sakagami, M']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/a0022099,MAY 2011,2,"Nonhuman primates, like humans, have demonstrated various physical intuitions. Cacchione and Krist (2004) examined chimpanzees' intuitions about support relations with the violation-of-expectation task. They reported that the chimpanzees possessed intuitions about support, but their intuitions differed from those of humans in part; they were sensitive to ""contact/no-contact"" and ""amount of contact"" but not ""type of contact"" rule. To further explore intuitions about support in nonhuman primates, we conducted similar experiments on monkeys (Japanese monkeys) and apes (chimpanzees). In three experiments, we presented physically possible and impossible events of different support relations to the participants and measured their looking times. The results reveal that the chimpanzees and monkeys detect the violations of ""contact/no-contact"" and ""amount of contact"" but not ""type of contact"" variable. Therefore, the apes and monkeys possess similar intuitions; however, these intuitions differ in part from those of humans. The present study provides new and corroborative evidence of intuitions about support in nonhuman primates. However, this again leads to the question of distinctive understanding about support relations among primate species."
Primates do not spontaneously use shape properties for object individuation: a competence or a performance problem?,"['Mendes, N', 'Rakoczy, H', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-010-0375-0,MAY 2011,6,"Several recent studies have documented that non-human primates can individuate objects according to property and/or kind information in much the same way as human infants do from around one year of age when they begin to acquire language. Some studies suggest, however, that only some properties are used for the individuation of food items: color, but not shape. The present study investigated whether these findings reveal a true competence problem with shape properties in the food domain or whether they merely reveal a performance problem (e.g., lack of attention to shapes). We tested 25 great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas) in two food individuation tasks. We manipulated subjects' experience with differences in color and shape properties of food items. Results indicated (i) that all subjects, regardless of their prior experience, solved the color-based object individuation task and (ii) that only the group with previous experience with different shape properties succeeded in the shape-based individuation task. Great apes can thus be primed to take shape into account for individuating food objects, and this results clearly speaks in favor of a performance (rather than a competence) problem in using shape for object individuation of food items."
Focus on the essential: all great apes know when others are being attentive,"['Tempelmann, S', 'Kaminski, J', 'Liebal, K']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-011-0378-5,MAY 2011,25,"When begging for food, all great ape species are sensitive to a human's attention. However, studies investigating which cues are relevant for chimpanzees to assess the attentional state of others have produced highly inconsistent results. Some have suggested chimpanzees differentiate attention based on the status of the face or even the eyes, while others have indicated that body posture alone is the relevant cue. Kaminski et al. (Anim Cogn 7:216-223, 2004) compared the behaviour of chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans while begging for food from a human experimenter who systematically varied his face and body orientation. Their results indicated that both factors, face and body orientation, affect apes' begging behaviour. The authors claimed that while body orientation provides information about the experimenter's general disposition to offer food, the visibility of the face provides information about the human's attentional state. In the current study, we tested this hypothesis with all four great apes species. However, unlike Kaminski et al. (Anim Cogn 7:216-223, 2004), the experimenter was able to hand over food regardless of body orientation. The results show that as soon as the offering of the food was no longer restricted, the orientation of the face became the key factor. Therefore, we present the first evidence that all great ape species are able to assess the attentional state of a recipient based on the orientation of the face."
Timing of ectocranial suture activity in Gorilla gorilla as related to cranial volume and dental eruption,"['Cray, J', 'Cooper, GM', 'Mooney, MP', 'Siegel, MI']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2011.01358.x,MAY 2011,6,"Research has shown that Pan and Homo have similar ectocranial suture synostosis patterns and a similar suture ontogeny (relative timing of suture fusion during the species ontogeny). This ontogeny includes patency during and after neurocranial expansion with a delayed bony response associated with adaptation to biomechanical forces generated by mastication. Here we investigate these relationships for Gorilla by examining the association among ectocranial suture morphology, cranial volume (as a proxy for neurocranial expansion) and dental development (as a proxy for the length of time that it has been masticating hard foods and exerting such strains on the cranial vault) in a large sample of Gorilla gorilla skulls. Two-hundred and fifty-five Gorilla gorilla skulls were examined for ectocranial suture closure status, cranial volume and dental eruption. Regression models were calculated for cranial volumes by suture activity, and Kendall's tau (a non-parametric measure of association) was calculated for dental eruption status by suture activity. Results suggest that, as reported for Pan and Homo, neurocranial expansion precedes suture synostosis activity. Here, Gorilla was shown to have a strong relationship between dental development and suture activity (synostosis). These data are suggestive of suture fusion extending further into ontogeny than brain expansion, similar to Homo and Pan. This finding allows for the possibility that masticatory forces influence ectocranial suture morphology."
Detection and Genetic Characterization of Enteroviruses Circulating among Wild Populations of Chimpanzees in Cameroon: Relationship with Human and Simian Enteroviruses,"['Harvala, H', 'Sharp, CP', 'Ngole, EM', 'Delaporte, E', 'Peeters, M', 'Simmonds, P']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.02285-10,MAY 2011,29,"Enteroviruses (EVs), members of the family Picornaviridae, are a genetically and antigenically diverse range of viruses causing acute infections in humans and several Old World monkey (OWM) species. Despite their known wide distribution in primates, nothing is currently known about the occurrence, frequency, and genetic diversity of enteroviruses infecting apes. To investigate this, 27 chimpanzee and 27 gorilla fecal samples collected from undisturbed jungle areas with minimal human contact in Cameroon were screened for EVs. Four chimpanzee samples were positive, but none of the gorilla samples were positive. Genetic characterization of the VP1, VP4, and partial VP2 genes, the 5' untranslated region, and partial 3Dpol sequences enabled chimpanzee-derived EVs to be identified as (i) the species A type, EV76, (ii) a new species D type assigned as EV111, along with a human isolate from the Democratic Republic of Congo previously described by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses, and (iii) a new species B type (assigned as EV110) most closely related to, although a distinct type from, the SA5 isolate recovered from a vervet monkey. The identification of EVs infecting chimpanzees related to those circulating in human and OWM populations provides evidence for cross-species transmission of EVs between primates. However, the direction of transfer and the existence of primate sources of zoonotic enterovirus infections in humans require further investigation of population exposure and more extensive characterization of EVs circulating in wild ape populations."
Proximate Composition of Milk From Free-Ranging Mountain Gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei),"['Whittier, CA', 'Milligan, LA', 'Nutter, FB', 'Cranfield, MR', 'Power, ML']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20363,MAY-JUN 2011,2,"Published data on milk composition for nonhuman primates, especially great apes, are lacking. Milk composition data are important for understanding the physiology and evolution of mammalian milk production, as well as the nutritional requirements of infants. For many primate species these data have added relevance because of the need to hand raise infants orphaned by poaching or separated from their mothers in captivity. The proximate composition (dry matter (DM), protein, fat, sugar) of free-ranging mountain gorilla (MG) (Gorilla beringei beringei) milk was characterized from samples (N = 10) collected opportunistically during field procedures. The mean values for mid-lactation (1-50 months) milk samples from healthy MGs (N = 7) were: 10.7% DM, 1.9% fat, 1.4% crude protein, 6.8% sugar, and 0.53 kcal/g. These results are lower in fat and total energy than most other Hominidae, including humans. One early-lactation sample was high in protein content while the composition of two samples from gorillas with poor health and suspected poor milk quality both deviated from the normal, mid-lactation pattern. This survey adds to the data available for primate milk composition and suggests that wild MG infants normally consume milk that is lower in fat and total energy than human milk.

It hosts many different animal species, including the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus). Very little is known about the ecology of chimpanzees inhabiting this area. The main aims of this study were to evaluate chimpanzee nesting behavior, define trends of habitat use, and estimate chimpanzee density in four separate forests by applying the marked nest counts methodology. From the 287 new nests counted, 92% were built in oil-palm trees with a significantly higher frequency of nests in the forest edge than in forest cores. Differences in nest detection rates were observed in the four monitored forests, with two forests being more important for chimpanzee's nesting demands. The number of nests documented in the forests seemed to be correlated with the frequency of other signs of chimpanzee activity. Although chimpanzees selected nests on the forest edge, they were most frequently observed in forest core areas. Constraints associated with estimating chimpanzee density through oil-palm nest counting are discussed. Am. J. Primatol. 73: 485-497, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Historical sampling reveals dramatic demographic changes in western gorilla populations,"['Thalmann, O', 'Wegmann, D', 'Spitzner, M', 'Arandjelovic, M', 'Guschanski, K', 'Leuenberger, C', 'Bergl, RA', 'Vigilant, L']",BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1186/1471-2148-11-85,APR 1 2011,20,"Background: Today many large mammals live in small, fragmented populations, but it is often unclear whether this subdivision is the result of long-term or recent events. Demographic modeling using genetic data can estimate changes in long-term population sizes while temporal sampling provides a way to compare genetic variation present today with that sampled in the past. In order to better understand the dynamics associated with the divergences of great ape populations, these analytical approaches were applied to western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and in particular to the isolated and Critically Endangered Cross River gorilla subspecies (G. g. diehli).

Results: We used microsatellite genotypes from museum specimens and contemporary samples of Cross River gorillas to infer both the long-term and recent population history. We find that Cross River gorillas diverged from the ancestral western gorilla population similar to 17,800 years ago (95% HDI: 760, 63,245 years). However, gene flow ceased only similar to 420 years ago (95% HDI: 200, 16,256 years), followed by a bottleneck beginning similar to 320 years ago (95% HDI: 200, 2,825 years) that caused a 60 fold decrease in the effective population size of Cross River gorillas. Direct comparison of heterozygosity estimates from museum and contemporary samples suggests a loss of genetic variation over the last 100 years.

Conclusions: The composite history of western gorillas could plausibly be explained by climatic oscillations inducing environmental changes in western equatorial Africa that would have allowed gorilla populations to expand over time but ultimately isolate the Cross River gorillas, which thereafter exhibited a dramatic population size reduction. The recent decrease in the Cross River population is accordingly most likely attributable to increasing anthropogenic pressure over the last several hundred years. Isolation of diverging populations with prolonged concomitant gene flow, but not secondary admixture, appears to be a typical characteristic of the population histories of African great apes, including gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos."
Great Apes Use Weight as a Cue to Find Hidden Food,"['Schrauf, C', 'Call, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20899,APR 2011,8,"Bonobos (Pan paniscus; n = 5), orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus abelii; n = 6), and a gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla; n = 1) were presented with two opaque cups, one empty and one baited (containing two bananas). Subjects had to independently gain weight information about the contents of the cups to find the hidden food. Six apes attained above chance level within a total of 16 trials. Successful subjects spontaneously adopted the method of successively lifting the cups and thus comparing their weight before making a choice. Prior to testing, these apes had participated in a weight discrimination task. To rule out that a subject's good performance was influenced by previous experience in weight experiments, we ran a second test in which the same task was presented to a group of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes; n = 9) who were naive to weight experiments. These subjects also participated in an additional test condition in which the same problem was presented based on learning to associate arbitrary visual stimuli. The results show that experience did not affect performance because the nine naive subjects were equally able to find the food when the task stimuli held a causal relation (i.e. weight indicates the hidden food). Interestingly, only one of the naive subjects solved the task when the task elements held an arbitrary relation (i.e. certain visual pattern indicates food). Our results confirm previous findings that apes perform better in problems grounded on causal compared to arbitrary relations. Am. J. Primatol. 73: 323-334, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Previous studies conducted during the 1970s when groups contained one to three adult males concluded that male-immature relationships were likely to be a form of low-cost paternal investment [Stewart, Mountain gorillas: three decades of research at Karisoke. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2001]. We evaluated whether this hypothesis still held in groups containing six to nine adult males, or if male-immature relationships might serve other functions (e. g. mating effort, kin selection, or alliance building). Overall, we found that immatures spent the most time near, and interacted most with, the alpha silverback. These behaviors peaked during the period when infants were still quite vulnerable but increasing their independence from their mothers. Such findings suggest that parenting effort remains the primary function of male-immature relationships; however, there is some evidence for the mating effort hypothesis as well. Am. J.

Comparative studies of placentation and immunology in non-human primates suggest a scenario for the evolution of deep trophoblast invasion and an explanation for human pregnancy disorders,"['Carter, AM']",REPRODUCTION,10.1530/REP-10-0530,APR 2011,18,"Deep trophoblast invasion in the placental bed has been considered the hallmark of human pregnancy. It occurs by two routes, interstitial and endovascular, and results in transformation of the walls of the spiral arteries as they traverse the decidua and the inner third of the myometrium. Disturbances in this process are associated with reproductive disorders such preeclampsia. In contrast, trophoblast invasion in Old World monkeys occurs only by the endovascular route and seldom reaches the myometrium. Recently, it was shown that this pattern is maintained in gibbons, but that the human arrangement also occurs in chimpanzee and gorilla. There is an interesting parallel with results from placental immunology regarding the evolution of the major histocompatability complex class I antigen HLA-C and its cognate receptors. HLA-C is not present in Old World monkeys or gibbons. It emerged in the orangutan and became polymorphic in the lineage leading to gorilla, bonobo, chimpanzee, and human. Interaction between HLA-C1 and HLA-C2 on the surface of trophoblast and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) expressed by uterine natural killer cells are important regulators of trophoblast invasion. Evolution of this system in great apes may have been one prerequisite for deep trophoblast invasion but seems to have come at a price. The evidence now suggests that certain combinations of maternal genotype for KIRs and fetal genotype for HLA-C imply an increased risk of preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and recurrent abortion. The fetal genotype is in part derived from the father providing an explanation for the paternal contribution to reproductive disorders. Reproduction (2011) 141 391-396"
Aging in the Natural World: Comparative Data Reveal Similar Mortality Patterns Across Primates,"['Bronikowski, AM', 'Altmann, J', 'Brockman, DK', 'Cords, M', 'Fedigan, LM', 'Pusey, A', 'Stoinski, T', 'Morris, WF', 'Strier, KB', 'Alberts, SC']",SCIENCE,10.1126/science.1201571,MAR 11 2011,40,"Human senescence patterns-late onset of mortality increase, slow mortality acceleration, and exceptional longevity-are often described as unique in the animal world. Using an individual-based data set from longitudinal studies of wild populations of seven primate species, we show that contrary to assumptions of human uniqueness, human senescence falls within the primate continuum of aging; the tendency for males to have shorter life spans and higher age-specific mortality than females throughout much of adulthood is a common feature in many, but not all, primates; and the aging profiles of primate species do not reflect phylogenetic position. These findings suggest that mortality patterns in primates are shaped by local selective forces rather than phylogenetic history."

This study illustrates distinct wildlife responses to logging and hunting in RDS sectors that vary in protection and enforcement levels and the erosion of some critical animal communities across the RDS in the face of challenges of increasing human populations and flows of arms and ammunitions there. Our results show elephants (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) to be appreciably absent close to human settlements, and increasingly vulnerable to hunting in the more integrally protected sectors far from town. We have found that duikers (Cephalophus sp.) and western lowland gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla) make use of recently logged areas but are vulnerable to hunting there. These species are now most abundant farthest from human settlements. Our results have implications for the formulation of adaptive management plans that would benefit from the inclusion of nuanced understandings of site-specific and species-specific responses to microhabitats and the particular kinds of human extractive activities and challenges in the region.Resume

It is currently found in 14 apparently geographically separate and increasingly isolated populations, which face severe threats from habitat loss and the bushmeat trade. Recent years have seen greater efforts to conserve the Cross River gorilla across the landscape, but details of the ecology of individual populations that might help in conservation initiatives are lacking. Here, we report on the production of the first habitat map for the recently created Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary (KGS), Cameroon, and the results of an analysis of nest site preferences of the gorillas that live there. Qualitative vegetation assessments were made to assign various categories to the topstory and understory throughout the sanctuary, and nest sites constructed between January 2006 and March 2008 were re-visited and assessed for possible site preferences. The habitat map revealed significant anthropogenic impact, with only 57% of the KGS being relatively undisturbed primary forest. Analysis of nest sites showed that ground nests are constructed preferentially in the dry season, on precipitous slopes, in light gaps and clearings, with an understory of mixed herbs. Tree nests are predominantly built in the wet season, in primary forest with saplings as the preferred understory. Gorillas avoid nesting in grasslands and farms, which visibly fragment the remaining forest in the sanctuary. The results have implications for the conservation and management of the Cross River gorilla at KGS, and offer new insight into the nesting ecology of this subspecies. Am. J.

Evolution of Metamorphism in Thymidylate Synthases Within the Primate Lineages,"['Luo, BB', 'Johnson, SR', 'Lebioda, L', 'Berger, SH']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,10.1007/s00239-011-9433-8,MAR 2011,2,"Crystal structures of human thymidylate synthase (hTS) revealed that the protein exists in active and inactive conformations, defined by the position of a loop containing the active site nucleophile. TS is highly homologous among diverse species; however, the residue at position 163 (hTS) differs among species. Arginine at this position is predicted by structural modeling to enable conformational switching. Arginine or lysine is reported at this position in all mammals in the GenBank and Ensembl databases, with arginine reported in only primates. Sequence analysis of the TS gene of representative primates revealed that arginine occurs at this relative position in all primates except a representative of prosimians. Mutant human proteins were created with residues at position 163 that occur in TSs from prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Catalytic constants (k(cat)) of mutant enzymes were 45-149% of hTS, with the lysine mutant (R163K) exhibiting the highest k(cat). The effect of lysine substitution on solution structure and on ligand binding was investigated. R163K exhibited higher intrinsic fluorescence, a more negative molar ellipticity, and higher dissociation constants (K-d) for ligands that modulate protein conformation than hTS. Temperature effects on intrinsic fluorescence and catalytic activity of hTS and R163K are consistent with proteins populating different conformational states. The data indicate that the enzyme with arginine at the position corresponding to 163 (hTS) evolved after the divergence of prosimians and simians and that substitution of lysine by arginine confers unique structural and functional properties to the enzyme expressed in simian primates."

The sequences of both LTRs were determined by nucleotide sequencing of separate PCR products from the primer-binding site or the bel region and LTRs. All protein motifs conserved among the primate FV were identified in SFVgor. Using phylogenetic analysis of the Gag, Pol and Env amino acid sequences, we demonstrate that SFVgor consistently clusters in accordance with a scenario of virus-host co-divergence."
Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) Fail a What-Where-When Task but Find Rewards by Using a Location-Based Association Strategy,"['Dekleva, M', 'Dufour, V', 'de Vries, H', 'Spruijt, BM', 'Sterck, EHM']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0016593,FEB 16 2011,4,"Recollecting the what-where-when of an episode, or episodic-like memory, has been established in corvids and rodents. In humans, a linkage between remembering the past and imagining the future has been recognised. While chimpanzees can plan for the future, their episodic-like memory has hardly been investigated. We tested chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with an adapted food-caching paradigm. They observed the baiting of two locations amongst four and chose one after a given delay (15 min, 1 h or 5 h). We used two combinations of food types, a preferred and a less preferred food that disappeared at different rates. The subjects had to base their choices on the time elapsed since baiting, and on their memory of which food was where. They could recover either their preferred food or the one that remained present. All animals failed to obtain the preferred or present foods above chance levels. They were like-wise unsuccessful at choosing baited cups above chance levels. The subjects, thus, failed to use any feature of the baiting events to guide their choices. Nonetheless, their choices were not random, but the result of a developed location-based association strategy. Choices in the second half of the study correlated with the rewards obtained at each location in the first half of the study, independent from the choices made for each location in the first half of the study. This simple location-based strategy yielded a fair amount of food. The animals' failure to remember the what-where-when in the presented set-up may be due to the complexity of the task, rather than an inability to form episodic-like memories, as they even failed to remember what was where after 15 minutes."

One bonobo (Pan paniscus) and two gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) appeared to make such inferences in both the visual and auditory domains. However, common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) were successful only in the visual domain, and Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) in neither. The present research built on this paradigm, and Experiment 1 yielded prima facie evidence of inference by exclusion in both domains for two common chimpanzees, and in the visual domain for two Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii). Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that two specific associative learning explanations could not readily account for these results. Because an important focus of the program of research was to assess the cognitive capacities of lesser apes (family Hylobatidae), we modified Call's original procedures to better suit their attentional and dispositional characteristics. In Experiment 1, testing was also attempted with three gibbon genera (Symphalangus, Nomascus, Hylobates), but none of the subjects completed the standard task. Further testing of three siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus) and a spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) using a faster method yielded prima facie evidence of inferential reasoning by exclusion in the visual domain among the siamangs (Experiment 4)."
Transfer and Acclimatization Effects on the Behavior of Two Species of African Great Ape (Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla) Moved to a Novel and Naturalistic Zoo Environment,"['Ross, SR', 'Wagner, KE', 'Schapiro, SJ', 'Hau, J', 'Lukas, KE']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-010-9441-3,FEB 2011,5,"Studying the effects of moving animals to new enclosures is of value to both captive managers and to scientists interested in the complex interplay between environment and behavior. Great apes represent some of the greatest challenges in this regard. Given the cognitive sophistication of these species and the substantial investments in new primate facilities, these investigations are particularly important. Using post-occupancy evaluation (POE) methodology, we compared behavior exhibited by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in indoor hardscape-type exhibits to behavior of the same individuals in new naturalistic enclosures with outdoor access. In the new facility, chimpanzees showed decreases in the frequency of abnormal behaviors and visual monitoring of humans (attention behaviors) whereas gorillas exhibited reduced agonism as well as decreased attention behaviors. Both gorillas and chimpanzees demonstrated higher rates of inactivity after transfer to the new facility. All subjects in addition demonstrated transitory changes in behavior after the move to the new facility (higher rates of scratching in yr 1 than in subsequent years), indicating a period of acclimatization. Seasonal effects on feeding behavior and activity levels (both species were more active in the winter) were evident as well. The results indicate that behavioral adjustment to a new facility is an extended process for both species and that seasonal effects should be considered in longitudinal analyses of acclimatization.

The physical features of the captive environment, including not only gross useable space but also environmental complexity, can have a significant influence on primate behavior and ultimately, animal welfare. But despite this connection, there remains relatively little conclusive data on how captive primates, especially great apes, use the spaces provided to them, especially in modern, indoor-outdoor enclosures that have become more prevalent in recent years. In this study, we used four years of detailed data on where 23 great apes (chimpanzees and gorillas) positioned themselves within a modern, indoor-outdoor zoo enclosure to determine not only how the apes utilized their space but also how access to outdoor areas affected their spatial selectivity. We found that both species used relatively little of their available space: chimpanzees and gorillas spent half their time in only 3.2 and 1.5% of their useable three-dimensional space, respectively. Chimpanzees utilized the outdoor space more than gorillas, but access to the outdoors did not affect space selectivity in the indoor area for either species. Although both species of ape were highly selective in their space use, consideration should be given to the importance of providing the choice to locate in a variety of spaces, including outdoor areas. These data represent an extremely detailed account of space selectivity by great apes in an indoor-outdoor environment and have substantial implications for future facility design and captive primate management.

Evolution of subterminal satellite (StSat) repeats in hominids,"['Koga, A', 'Notohara, M', 'Hirai, H']",GENETICA,10.1007/s10709-010-9534-0,FEB 2011,8,"Subterminal satellite (StSat) repeats, consisting of 32-bp-long AT-rich units (GATATTTCCATGTT(T/C)ATACAGATAGCGGTGTA), were first found in chimpanzee and gorilla (African great apes) as one of the major components of heterochromatic regions located proximal to telomeres of chromosomes. StSat repeats have not been found in orangutan (Asian great ape) or human. This patchy distribution among species suggested that the StSat repeats were present in the common ancestor of African great apes and subsequently lost in the lineage leading to human. An alternative explanation is that the StSat repeats in chimpanzee and gorilla have different origins and the repeats did not occur in human. The purpose of the present study was quantitative evaluation of the above alternative possibilities by analyzing the nucleotide variation contained in the repeats. We collected large numbers of sequences of repeat units from genome sequence databases of chimpanzee and gorilla, and also bonobo (an African great ape phylogenetically closer to chimpanzee). We then compared the base composition of the repeat units among the 3 species, and found statistically significant similarities in the base composition. These results support the view that the StSat repeats had already formed multiple arrays in the common ancestor of African great apes. It is thus suggested that humans lost StSat repeats which had once grown to multiple arrays."
Ecological divergence and medial cuneiform morphology in gorillas,"['Tocheri, MW', 'Solhan, CR', 'Orr, CM', 'Femiani, J', 'Frohlich, B', 'Groves, CP', 'Harcourt-Smith, WE', 'Richmond, BG', 'Shoelson, B', 'Jungers, WL']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.09.002,FEB 2011,21,"Gorillas are more closely related to each other than to any other extant primate and are all terrestrial knuckle-walkers, but taxa differ along a gradient of dietary strategies and the frequency of arboreality in their behavioral repertoire. In this study, we test the hypothesis that medial cuneiform morphology falls on a morphocline in gorillas that tracks function related to hallucial abduction ability and relative frequency of arboreality. This morphocline predicts that western gorillas, being the most arboreal, should display a medial cuneiform anatomy that reflects the greatest hallucial abduction ability, followed by grauer gorillas, and then by mountain gorillas. Using a three-dimensional methodology to measure angles between articular surfaces, relative articular and nonarticular areas, and the curvatures of the hallucial articular surface, the functional predictions are partially confirmed in separating western gorillas from both eastern gorillas. Western gorillas are characterized by a more medially oriented, proportionately larger, and more mediolaterally curved hallucial facet than are eastern gorillas. These characteristics follow the predictions for a more prehensile hallux in western gorillas relative to a more stable, plantigrade hallux in eastern gorillas. The characteristics that distinguish eastern gorilla taxa from one another appear unrelated to hallucial abduction ability or frequency of arboreality. In total, this reexamination of medial cuneiform morphology suggests differentiation between eastern and western gorillas due to a longstanding ecological divergence and more recent and possibly non-adaptive differences between eastern taxa.

How Artificial Communication Affects the Communication and Cognition of the Great Apes,"['Call, J']",MIND & LANGUAGE,10.1111/j.1468-0017.2010.01408.x,FEB 2011,3,"Ape species-specific communication is grounded on the present, possesses some referential qualities and is mostly used to request objects or actions from others. Artificial systems of communication borrowed from humans transform apes' communicative exchanges by freeing them from the present (i.e. displaced reference) although requests still predominate as the main reason for communicating with others. Symbol use appears to enhance apes' relational abilities and their inhibitory control. Despite these substantial changes, it is concluded that even though artificial communication enhances thought and enables its expression more openly, it does not create it or modify the motivation behind communicative exchanges."

A survey was conducted in 2007 in five villages to assess local perceptions of human-gorilla totemic kinship practices and taboos against hunting and against eating of gorillas. Villages were selected based on their proximity to Cross River gorilla (CRG) habitat, with a total of 184 interviewer-administered questionnaires completed during a 4-week period. Eighty-six percent of people agreed that gorillas were totems (personal spiritual helpers or counterparts) of people living in the village. People who believed in human-gorilla totemic kinship practice did not eat or hunt gorillas, and they wanted gorillas to be protected in order to protect the practice. Most (87%), of the interviewees declared their support for gorilla conservation. The main motivation was the belief that when gorillas are killed, the human totemic counterpart will die as a result. Because of these traditions, the hunting of gorillas is taboo in all five villages surveyed. On the other hand, gorilla parts play a direct role in traditional medicine, and gorilla bones are valued as ingredients for traditional medicine. Also, general awareness and adherence to local totemic practices was found to be declining, particularly among young people (18-25 years). Despite the imminent decline in value of belief systems that led to the establishment of the hunting taboo, this taboo is still in place and has discouraged the hunting of gorillas. Where law enforcement is weak or near inexistent, these traditional restrictions could be critical to the continuing survival of a gorilla population. Reviving and promoting beliefs and practices conducive to gorilla conservation could foster positive attitudes and behavior and have the potential to encourage local support and participation in communities. However, care must be taken when selecting practices to promote, as some (for example the use of gorillas in traditional medicine) could encourage the killing of animals."

A sample, drawn from a variety of sources, of known-aged captive great ape skeletons was analyzed to test the usefulness of using the basilar suture to categorize adult skeletons as either ""adult'' or ""old adult''. The state of closure of the basilar suture was examined in 30 chimpanzees, 19 gorillas, and 15 orangutans, all of known age. The results show that the basilar suture demonstrates a high level of uniformity in rate of closure and is closed at an early age in virtually all known-aged individuals. Thus, an old adult category most likely includes individuals who are, in fact, relatively young. This indicates that using the basilar suture as a means to classify individual skeletons as adult or old adult is very imprecise. The homogenous nature of basilar suture closure appears to prevent meaningful application of suture status for categorizing adult ape skeletons by age groups. Am J Phys Anthropol 144:162-165, 2011.

Black and Gold Howler Monkeys (Alouatta caraya) as Sentinels of Ecosystem Health: Patterns of Zoonotic Protozoa Infection Relative to Degree of Human-Primate Contact,"['Kowalewski, MM', 'Salzer, JS', 'Deutsch, JC', 'Rano, M', 'Kuhlenschmidt, MS', 'Gillespie, TR']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20803,JAN 2011,15,"Exponential expansion of human populations and human activities within primate habitats has resulted in high potential for pathogen exchange creating challenges for biodiversity conservation and global health. Under such conditions, resilient habitat generalists such as black and gold howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya) may act as effective sentinels to overall ecosystem health and alert us to impending epidemics in the human population. To better understand this potential, we examined noninvasively collected fecal samples from black and gold howler monkeys from remote, rural, and village populations in Northern Argentina. We examined all samples (n = 90) for the zoonotic protozoa Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia sp. via immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) detection. All samples were negative for Cryptosporidium sp. The prevalence of Giardia sp. was significantly higher at the rural site (67%) compared with the remote forest (57%) and village (40%) sites. A lack of Cryptosporidium sp. in all samples examined suggests that this pathogen is not a natural component of the howler parasite communities at these sites and that current land-use patterns and livestock contact are not exposing Argentine howler monkeys to this pathogen. High prevalence of Giardia sp. at all sites suggests that howler monkeys may serve as a viable reservoir for Giardia. Significantly higher prevalence of Giardia sp. at the rural site, where primate-livestock contact is highest, suggests the presence of multiple Giardia clades or increased exposure to Giardia through repeated zoonotic transmission among nonhuman primates, livestock, and/or people. These results highlight the need for future research into the epidemiology, cross-species transmission ecology, and clinical consequences of Giardia and other infectious agents not only in humans and livestock, but also in the wild animals that share their environments.

We tested six Clark's nutcrackers in a two-way object-choice task using touch, point, and gaze cues to investigate whether these birds can use human gestures to find food. Most of the birds were able to use a touch gesture during the first trial of testing and were able to learn to use point and gaze (eyes and head alternation) cues after a limited number of trials. This study is the first to test a non-social corvid on the object-choice task. The performance of non-social nutcrackers is similar to that of more social and related corvids, suggesting that species with different evolutionary histories can utilize gestural information."

Some differences are due to anatomical changes that occurred during human evolution. However, many cannot be explained either by these changes or by known environmental factors. Because chimpanzees were long considered models for human disease, it is important to be aware of these differences, which appear to have been deemphasized relative to similarities. We focus on the pathophysiology and pathobiology of biomedical conditions that appear unique to humans, including several speculative possibilities that require further study. We pay particular attention to the possible contributions of uniquely human changes in the biology of cell-surface sialic acids and the proteins that recognize them. We also discuss the metabolic incorporation of a diet-derived nonhuman sialic acid, which generates a novel xeno-autoantigen reaction, and chronic inflammation known as xenosialitis."
Testing brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus) on the reverse-reward contingency task without a modified procedure,"['Genty, E', 'Chung, PCS', 'Roeder, JJ']",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,10.1016/j.beproc.2010.10.006,JAN 2011,6,"A common paradigm used to study inhibitory control is the reverse-reward contingency task in which the subject is presented with a choice between two different quantities of food and is rewarded with the non-chosen item. Most animals have problems inhibiting their impulsive choice towards the larger quantity, and need correction procedures to master the reverse-reward task. Recent studies have nonetheless shown that rhesus macaques and white crowned mangabeys were able to master the task without correction procedures after a large number of trials were applied.

We previously demonstrated that, similar to other primates tested under the reverse-reward contingency task, lemurs initially showed an impulsive bias towards the larger quantity of food. But following introduction of a large-or-none contingency, all the subjects learned to reliably select the smaller quantity in order to gain access to the larger one. Here, we assessed the possibility that, similar to rhesus macaques and mangabeys, lemurs could master the reverse-reward task, without a modified procedure, by presenting a large number of trials. One of 5 subjects was able to master the task and then generalize performance to novel food arrays. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Gorilla and Orangutan Brains Conform to the Primate Cellular Scaling Rules: Implications for Human Evolution,"['Herculano-Houzel, S', 'Kaas, JH']",BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION,10.1159/000322729,2011,20,"Gorillas and orangutans are primates at least as large as humans, but their brains amount to about one third of the size of the human brain. This discrepancy has been used as evidence that the human brain is about 3 times larger than it should be for a primate species of its body size. In contrast to the view that the human brain is special in its size, we have suggested that it is the great apes that might have evolved bodies that are unusually large, on the basis of our recent finding that the cellular composition of the human brain matches that expected for a primate brain of its size, making the human brain a linearly scaled-up primate brain in its number of cells. To investigate whether the brain of great apes also conforms to the primate cellular scaling rules identified previously, we determine the numbers of neuronal and other cells that compose the orangutan and gorilla cerebella, use these numbers to calculate the size of the brain and of the cerebral cortex expected for these species, and show that these match the sizes described in the literature. Our results suggest that the brains of great apes also scale linearly in their numbers of neurons like other primate brains, including humans. The conformity of great apes and humans to the linear cellular scaling rules that apply to other primates that diverged earlier in primate evolution indicates that prehistoric Homo species as well as other hominins must have had brains that conformed to the same scaling rules, irrespective of their body size. We then used those scaling rules and published estimated brain volumes for various hominin species to predict the numbers of neurons that composed their brains. We predict that Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis had brains with approximately 80 billion neurons, within the range of variation found in modern Homo sapiens. We propose that while the cellular scaling rules that apply to the primate brain have remained stable in hominin evolution (since they apply to simians, great apes and modern humans alike), the Colobinae and Pongidae lineages favored marked increases in body size rather than brain size from the common ancestor with the Homo lineage, while the Homo lineage seems to have favored a large brain instead of a large body, possibly due to the metabolic limitations to having both.

Behavioral Responses of Silverback Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) to Videos,"['Maloney, MA', 'Leighty, KA', 'Kuhar, CW', 'Bettinger, TL']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,10.1080/10888705.2011.551621,2011,1,"This study examined the impact of video presentations on the behavior of 4 silverback, western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). On each of 5 occasions, gorillas viewed 6 types of videos (blue screen, humans, an all-male or mixed-sex group engaged in low activity, and an all-male or mixed-sex group engaged in agonistic behavior). The study recorded behavioral responses and watching rates. All gorillas preferred dynamic over static videos; 3 watched videos depicting gorillas significantly more than those depicting humans. Among the gorilla videos, the gorillas clearly preferred watching the mixed-sex group engaged in agonistic behavior; yet, this did not lead to an increase in aggression or behavior indicating agitation. Further, habituation to videos depicting gorillas did not occur. This supports the effectiveness of this form of enrichment, particularly for a nonhuman animal needing to be separated temporarily due to illness, shipment quarantine, social restructuring, or exhibit modification."

We analyzed samples from 30 wild chimpanzees and one captive gorilla and identified two new groups of polyomaviruses (PyVs). These new viruses are by far the closest relatives to MCPyV described to date, providing the first evidence of the natural occurrence of PyVs related to MCPyV in wild great apes. Similar to MCPyV, the prevalence of these viruses is relatively high (>30%). This, together with the fact that humans in West and Central Africa frequently hunt and butcher primates, may point toward further MCPyV-like strains spreading to, or already existing in, our species."
Extreme Conservation Leads to Recovery of the Virunga Mountain Gorillas,"['Robbins, MM', 'Gray, M', 'Fawcett, KA', 'Nutter, FB', 'Uwingeli, P', 'Mburanumwe, I', 'Kagoda, E', 'Basabose, A', 'Stoinski, TS', 'Cranfield, MR', 'Byamukama, J', 'Spelman, LH', 'Robbins, AM']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0019788,JUN 8 2011,27,"As wildlife populations are declining, conservationists are under increasing pressure to measure the effectiveness of different management strategies. Conventional conservation measures such as law enforcement and community development projects are typically designed to minimize negative human influences upon a species and its ecosystem. In contrast, we define ""extreme"" conservation as efforts targeted to deliberately increase positive human influences, including veterinary care and close monitoring of individual animals. Here we compare the impact of both conservation approaches upon the population growth rate of the critically endangered Virunga mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), which increased by 50% since their nadir in 1981, from approximately 250 to nearly 400 gorillas. Using demographic data from 1967-2008, we show an annual decline of 0.7%+/- 0.059% for unhabituated gorillas that received intensive levels of conventional conservation approaches, versus an increase 4.1%+/- 0.088% for habituated gorillas that also received extreme conservation measures. Each group of habituated gorillas is now continuously guarded by a separate team of field staff during daylight hours and receives veterinary treatment for snares, respiratory disease, and other life-threatening conditions. These results suggest that conventional conservation efforts prevented a severe decline of the overall population, but additional extreme measures were needed to achieve positive growth. Demographic stochasticity and socioecological factors had minimal impact on variability in the growth rates. Veterinary interventions could account for up to 40% of the difference in growth rates between habituated versus unhabituated gorillas, with the remaining difference likely arising from greater protection against poachers. Thus, by increasing protection and facilitating veterinary treatment, the daily monitoring of each habituated group contributed to most of the difference in growth rates. Our results argue for wider consideration of extreme measures and offer a startling view of the enormous resources that may be needed to conserve some endangered species."
Three-dimensional orientations of talar articular surfaces in humans and great apes,"['Kanamoto, S', 'Ogihara, N', 'Nakatsukasa, M']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-010-0219-1,JAN 2011,5,"The morphology of the talus prescribes relative positions and movements of the calcaneus and navicular with respect to the tibia, hence determining the overall geometry, mobility and function of the foot that mechanically interacts with environments. Clarifying the variations of the articular surface orientations of the talus in humans and extant great apes is therefore of importance in understanding the evolution of bipedal locomotion in the human lineage. The aim of this study is to clarify the three-dimensional orientations of three articular surfaces of the talus (superior, posterior calcaneal and navicular articular surfaces) by means of the newly proposed surface approximation method. Thirty-two tali in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans were scanned using a three-dimensional noncontact digitizer, and the articular surfaces were then approximated using a paraboloid or a plane to calculate the orientations of the surfaces with respect to the body of the talus. The results quantitatively demonstrated that the superior articular surfaces in humans were relatively more parallel with the horizontal plane of the talar body, while those in apes were more medially oriented. Furthermore, the cylindrical axis defined by the shape of the posterior calcaneal articular surface was directed less anteroposteriorly in humans than in apes, in contrast to the fact that the subtalar axis is more anteroposteriorly oriented in humans. It was also demonstrated that the navicular articular surface in humans was more plantarly oriented and axially twisted. These specialized features of the human talus seem to be functionally linked to obligate bipedal locomotion. The talar morphological differences among the great apes were prominent in the mediolateral and rotational orientations of the navicular articular surfaces, possibly reflecting the degree of arboreality among the great apes."
"HIV-1 Group P is unable to antagonize human tetherin by Vpu, Env or Nef","['Sauter, D', 'Hue, S', 'Petit, SJ', 'Plantier, JC', 'Towers, GJ', 'Kirchhoff, F', 'Gupta, RK']",RETROVIROLOGY,10.1186/1742-4690-8-103,DEC 15 2011,32,"Background: A new subgroup of HIV-1, designated Group P, was recently detected in two unrelated patients of Cameroonian origin. HIV-1 Group P phylogenetically clusters with SIVgor suggesting that it is the result of a crossspecies transmission from gorillas. Until today, HIV-1 Group P has only been detected in two patients, and its degree of adaptation to the human host is largely unknown. Previous data have shown that pandemic HIV-1 Group M, but not non-pandemic Group O or rare Group N viruses, efficiently antagonize the human orthologue of the restriction factor tetherin (BST-2, HM1.24, CD317) suggesting that primate lentiviruses may have to gain antitetherin activity for efficient spread in the human population. Thus far, three SIV/ HIV gene products (vpu, nef and env) are known to have the potential to counteract primate tetherin proteins, often in a species-specific manner. Here, we examined how long Group P may have been circulating in humans and determined its capability to antagonize human tetherin as an indicator of adaptation to humans.

Results: Our data suggest that HIV-1 Group P entered the human population between 1845 and 1989. Vpu, Env and Nef proteins from both Group P viruses failed to counteract human or gorilla tetherin to promote efficient release of HIV-1 virions, although both Group P Nef proteins moderately downmodulated gorilla tetherin from the cell surface. Notably, Vpu, Env and Nef alleles from the two HIV-1 P strains were all able to reduce CD4 cell surface expression.

Conclusions: Our analyses of the two reported HIV-1 Group P viruses suggest that zoonosis occurred in the last 170 years and further support that pandemic HIV-1 Group M strains are better adapted to humans than nonpandemic or rare Group O, N and P viruses. The inability to antagonize human tetherin may potentially explain the limited spread of HIV-1 Group P in the human population."
A New Look at an Old Canal,"['Marom, A']",SKULL BASE-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH,10.1055/s-0030-1263282,JAN 2011,2,"Attempts to explain abducens vulnerability have centered around the petroclival segment of its pathway in the skull base, in particular, its relations to the Dorello's canal and the petrosphenoidal ligament of Gruber. This study aims to contribute to the definition of the Dorello's canal and to the understanding of abducens vulnerability from an evolutionary perspective. The petroclival region and the Dorello's canal in particular were examined in a sample of 86 primate skulls. The sample contains 20 Pan troglodytes (common chimpanzee), 35 Gorilla gorilla, 20 Pongo pygmaeus (orangoutan), and 11 Hylobates moloch (gibbon) skulls. Distance between the petrous apex and tip of the posterior clinoid process was measured using a 10-mm scale that was inserted into the endocranium. Complete absence of the Gruber ligament and an uninterrupted osseous circumference of the Dorello's canal (foramen) was demonstrated in all nonhuman primate species. Whatever the reason for the morphological difference between the human and ape Dorello's canal, it is without a doubt suggestive of the source of vulnerability of the abducens nerve, as the ligament of Gruber, unique to the human configuration, renders the contents of the Dorello's canal susceptible to compression against the cranial base."
The evolution of menopause in cetaceans and humans: the role of demography,"['Johnstone, RA', 'Cant, MA']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rspb.2010.0988,DEC 22 2010,48,"Human females stop reproducing long before they die. Among other mammals, only pilot and killer whales exhibit a comparable period of post-reproductive life. The grandmother hypothesis suggests that kin selection can favour post-reproductive survival when older females help their relatives to reproduce. But although there is an evidence that grandmothers can provide such assistance, it is puzzling why menopause should have evolved only among the great apes and toothed whales. We have previously suggested (Cant & Johnstone 2008 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci.

But this argument appears inapplicable to menopausal cetaceans, which exhibit philopatry of both sexes combined with extra-group mating. Here, we derive general formulae for 'kinship dynamics', the age-related changes in local relatedness that occur in long-lived social organisms as a consequence of dispersal and mortality. We show that the very different social structures of great apes and menopausal whales both give rise to an increase in local relatedness with female age, favouring late-life helping. Our analysis can therefore help to explain why, of all long-lived, social mammals, it is specifically among the great apes and toothed whales that menopause and post-reproductive helping have evolved."
"Specific Gravity and Creatinine as Corrections for Variation in Urine Concentration in Humans, Gorillas, and Woolly Monkeys","['White, BC', 'Jamison, KM', 'Grieb, C', 'Lally, D', 'Luckett, C', 'Kramer, KS', 'Phillips, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20867,DEC 2010,9,"\ Hormones excreted in the urine are widely used to assess the physiological and psychological condition of unrestrained animals. In order to control for variation in the water concentration of urine samples, the hormone concentration is often indexed to the concentration of creatinine. Because there are several problems with using creatinine, we have investigated the efficacy of specific gravity as an alternative basis for adjusting the hormone concentration in humans, gorillas, and woolly monkeys. In an experimental manipulation of human urine hydration, ten volunteers drank a water load proportional to body weight, and provided complete urine collection and saliva samples for four consecutive 20 min intervals. From the urine, we measured cortisol (radioimmunoassay), creatinine (colorimetric assay), and specific gravity (refractometer). Only cortisol was assayed from saliva. During 80 min following water ingestion, cortisol, creatinine, and specific gravity declined as urine became diluted; however, total cortisol excretion remained constant. Only cortisol concentration indexed to specific gravity accurately reflected the consistent cortisol excretion. Specific gravity and creatinine-corrected cortisol values were highly correlated but were significantly different. Salivary cortisol provided evidence for the relative stability of serum cortisol. To determine the utility of these corrections in other primates, we compared specific gravity-and creatinine-corrected cortisol in urine samples from captive gorillas (N = 16) and woolly monkeys (N = 8). As with the human study, the two corrections were strongly correlated in each species, but the means were different. Specific gravity correction was superior in revealing the circadian variation in cortisol. Am. J. Primatol. 72:1082-1091, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
A comparison of bonobo and chimpanzee tool use: evidence for a female bias in the Pan lineage,"['Gruber, T', 'Clay, Z', 'Zuberbuhler, K']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.09.005,DEC 2010,25,"Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, are the most sophisticated tool-users among all nonhuman primates. From an evolutionary perspective, it is therefore puzzling that the tool use behaviour of their closest living primate relative, the bonobo, Pan paniscus, has been described as particularly poor. However, only a small number of bonobo groups have been studied in the wild and only over comparably short periods. Here, we show that captive bonobos and chimpanzees are equally diverse tool-users inmost contexts. Our observations illustrate that tool use in bonobos can be highly complex and no different from what has been described for chimpanzees. The only major difference in the chimpanzee and bonobo data was that bonobos of all age-sex classes used tools in a play context, a possible manifestation of their neotenous nature. We also found that female bonobos displayed a larger range of tool use behaviours than males, a pattern previously described for chimpanzees but not for other great apes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the female-biased tool use evolved prior to the split between bonobos and chimpanzees. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Apes in a changing world - the effects of global warming on the behaviour and distribution of African apes,"['Lehmann, J', 'Korstjens, AH', 'Dunbar, RIM']",JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02373.x,DEC 2010,13,"Aim

In this study we use a modelling approach to identify: (1) the factors responsible for the differences in ape biogeography, (2) the effects that global warming might have on distribution patterns of African apes, (3) the underlying mechanisms for these effects, and (4) the implications that behavioural flexibility might be expected to have for ape survival. All African apes are highly endangered, and the need for efficient conservation methods is a top priority. The expected changes in world climate are likely to further exacerbate the difficulties they face. Our study aims to further understand the mechanisms that link climatic conditions to the behaviour and biogeography of ape species.

Location

Africa.

Method

We use an existing validated time budgets model, derived from data on 20 natural populations of gorillas (Gorilla beringei and Gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus), which specifies the relationship between climate, group size, body weight and time available for various activities, to predict ape distribution across Africa under a uniform worst-case climate change scenario.

Results

We demonstrate that a worst-case global warming scenario is likely to alter the delicate balance between different time budget components. Our model points to the importance of annual temperature variation, which was found to have the strongest impact on ape biogeography. Our simulation indicates that rising temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns are likely to have strong effects on ape survival and distribution, particularly for gorillas. Even if they behaved with maximum flexibility, gorillas may not be able to survive in most of their present habitats if the climate was to undergo extreme changes. The survival of chimpanzees was found to be strongly dependent on the minimum viable group size required.

Main conclusions

Our model allows us to explore how climatic conditions, individual behaviour and morphological traits may interact to limit the biogeographical distributions of these species, thereby allowing us to predict the effects of climate change on African ape distributions under different climate change regimes. The model suggests that climate variability (i.e. seasonality) plays a more important role than the absolute magnitude of the change, but these data are not normally provided by climate models."
"Urinary estrogens, progesterone, and LH changes during normal menstrual cycles of a captive female pileated gibbon (Hylobates pileatus)","['Aramaki, Y', 'Oae, H', 'Mouri, Y', 'Takizawa, K', 'Nakanishi, K', 'Hyoudou, Y', 'Omasa, M', 'Kusunoki, H']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1111/j.1600-0684.2010.00424.x,DEC 2010,0,Urinary steroid hormones and luteinizing hormone (LH) were monitored in a female pileated gibbon. The LH concentration almost peaked the day after estrogens peaks. The progesterone increased sharply after the LH peaks. Our results revealed for the first time the relationship between daily changes in urinary hormones throughout normal menstrual cycles in pileated gibbon.
DISCREPANCIES IN THE OCCURRENCE OF BALANTIDIUM COLI BETWEEN WILD AND CAPTIVE AFRICAN GREAT APES,"['Pomajbikova, K', 'Petrzelkova, KJ', 'Profousova, I', 'Modry, D']",JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY,10.1645/GE-2433.1,DEC 2010,8,"Balantidium coli is a ciliate reported in many mammalian species, including African great apes. In the former, asymptomatic infections as well as clinical balantidiasis have been reported in captivity. We carried out a cross-sectional study of B. coli in African great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, and both species of gorillas) and examined 1,161 fecal samples from 28 captive facilities in Europe, plus 2 sanctuaries and 11 wild sites in Africa. Samples were analyzed with the use of Sheather's flotation and merthiolate iodine formaldehyde (MIFC) sedimentation. MIFC sedimentation was the more sensitive technique for diagnostics of B. coli in apes. Although not detected in any wild-ape populations, B. coli was diagnosed in 52.6% of captive individuals. Surprisingly, in the apes' feces, trophozoites of B. coli were commonly detected, in contrast with other animals, e.g., Old World monkeys, pigs, etc. Most likely reservoirs for B. coli in captive apes include synantropic rats. High starch diets in captive apes are likely to exacerbate the occurrence of balantidiasis in captive apes."

Disease processes included severe thoracic and axillary cutaneous ulceration of T2-3 dermatome distribution, gastroenteritis, ulcerative stomatitis, emaciation, hind limb weakness or paresis, and decubitus ulcers of the ankles and elbows. Ante- and postmortem infectious disease screening revealed that this animal was not infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, simian varicella virus (SVV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), or hepatitis B virus; but was infected with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV). It is hypothesized that recrudescence of VZV and other disease processes described were associated with chronic STLV infection and the end of a characteristically long incubation period."

We identified a novel AdV in the feces of captive gorillas by isolation in cell culture, electron microscopy and PCR. From the supernatants of infected cultures we amplified DNA polymerase (DPOL), preterminal protein (pTP) and hexon gene sequences with generic pan primate AdV PCR assays. The sequences in-between were amplified by long-distance PCRs of 2 - 10 kb length, resulting in a final sequence of 15.6 kb. Phylogenetic analysis placed the novel gorilla AdV into a cluster of primate AdVs belonging to the species Human adenovirus B (HAdV-B). Depending on the analyzed gene, its position within the cluster was variable. To further elucidate its origin, feces samples of wild gorillas were analyzed. AdV hexon sequences were detected which are indicative for three distinct and novel gorilla HAdV-B viruses, among them a virus nearly identical to the novel AdV isolated from captive gorillas. This shows that the discovered virus is a member of a group of HAdV-B viruses that naturally infect gorillas. The mixed phylogenetic clusters of gorilla, chimpanzee, bonobo and human AdVs within the HAdV-B species indicate that host switches may have been a component of the evolution of human and non-human primate HAdV-B viruses."
Ape Behavior in Two Alternating Environments: Comparing Exhibit and Short-Term Holding Areas,"['Ross, SR', 'Wagner, KE', 'Schapiro, SJ', 'Hau, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20857,NOV 2010,9,"In many facilities, primates are voluntarily transferred between different enclosures on a daily basis to facilitate animal husbandry and exhibit maintenance. This procedure is particularly relevant in the management of great apes living in zoos, where the requirements of functional management must be balanced with the desire to maintain enriching and naturalistic exhibit enclosures that benefit ape residents and attract the visiting public. In these settings, examinations of ape behavior and welfare typically focus exclusively on activity in the primary exhibit area. However, physical, social and sensory experiences unique to each area may shape different patterns of behavior. In the current study, zoo-living chimpanzees and gorillas were moved each day from exhibit areas to off-exhibit holding areas for a short duration as a part of regular management procedures. Behavioral data indicated species-specific reactions to the holding area, including increased aggression and self-directed behavior by chimpanzees and increased activity and prosocial behavior among gorilla subjects. Both species showed more feeding-foraging behavior while in the exhibit enclosure. Results suggest that holding areas may not meet all behavior needs of captive great apes and demonstrate the importance of including all components of the captive enclosure in comprehensive analyses of great ape behavior and welfare.

Semantics of primate gestures: intentional meanings of orangutan gestures,"['Cartmill, EA', 'Byrne, RW']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-010-0328-7,NOV 2010,31,"Great ape gesture has become a research topic of intense interest, because its intentionality and flexibility suggest strong parallels to human communication. Yet the fundamental question of whether an animal species' gestures carry specific meanings has hardly been addressed. We set out a systematic approach to studying intentional meaning in the gestural communication of non-humans and apply it to a sample of orangutan gestures. We propose that analysis of meaning should be limited to gestures for which (1) there is strong evidence for intentional production and (2) the recipient's final reaction matches the presumed goal of the signaller, as determined independently. This produces a set of ""successful"" instances of gesture use, which we describe as having goal-outcome matches. In this study, 28 orangutans in three European zoos were observed for 9 months. We distinguished 64 gestures on structural grounds, 40 of which had frequent goal-outcome matches and could therefore be analysed for meaning. These 40 gestures were used predictably to achieve one of 6 social goals: to initiate an affiliative interaction (contact, grooming, or play), request objects, share objects, instigate co-locomotion, cause the partner to move back, or stop an action. Twenty-nine of these gestures were used consistently with a single meaning. We tested our analysis of gesture meaning by examining what gesturers did when the response to their gesture did not match the gesture's meaning. Subsequent actions of the gesturer were consistent with our assignments of meaning to gestures. We suggest that, despite their contextual flexibility, orangutan gestures are made with the expectation of specific behavioural responses and thus have intentional meanings as well as functional consequences."
"Lac Tele structure, Republic of Congo Geological setting of a cryptozoological and biodiversity hotspot, and evidence against an impact origin","['Master, S']",JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES,10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2009.07.017,NOV 2010,2,"Lac Tele is a large lake similar to 5 6 km in diameter with an ovoid shape situated at 17 degrees 10 E 1 degrees 20'N in the great tropical rain forest region of the Republic of Congo This lake has attracted widespread attention mainly because of the legends among the local people that it harbours a strange animal known as the Mokele Mbembe but also because it is situated in a region that is a hotbed of biodiversity and conservation efforts with respect to various endangered mammalian species including gorillas and chimpanzees Because of its appearance Lac Tele has been regarded as a possible meteorite impact structure Various expeditions studying cryptozoology conservation ecology biodiversity and the impact hypothesis have visited Lac Tele in the past several decades

The Lac Tele structure is located in the NW part of the intracratonic Congo Basin in a region dominated by Holocene alluvium dense tropical rain forest and swamps which form part of the basin of the Likouala aux Herbes a multi-branched meandering river flowing over very low gradients into the Sangha river a major tributary of the Congo river Previous bathymetric studies have shown that the average depth of Lac Tele is only 4 m including organic rich silty sediments The structure is that of a flat-bottomed dish

Model ling of the Lac Tele as an impact structure indicates a number of features which ought to be present The absence of any of these features coupled with the irregular ovoid shape the palynological record and the location of the structure at the intersection of major regional lineaments is regarded as evidence against the Impact hypothesis

Lac Tele as an isolated lake ecosystem is not unique in the Congo Basin and there are several other similar small shallow isolated lakes surrounded by rain forest and marshes some of which formed by damming of drainage systems by neotectonic faults It is suggested that the formation of Lac Tele may be related to its location over neotectonically reactivated regional lineaments which are also seismically active Lac Tele and other similar hydrologic systems may be biodiversity hotspots because they acted as refugia following neotectonic hydrological re-organization of the Congo Basin (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved"
Retrieving chronological age from dental remains of early fossil hominins to reconstruct human growth in the past,"['Dean, MC', 'SOUTH-AFRICAN AUSTRALOPITHECINES']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2010.0052,OCT 27 2010,28,"A chronology of dental development in Pan troglodytes is arguably the best available model with which to compare and contrast reconstructed dental chronologies of the earliest fossil hominins. Establishing a time scale for growth is a requirement for being able to make further comparative observations about timing and rate during both dento-skeletal growth and brain growth. The absolute timing of anterior tooth crown and root formation appears not to reflect the period of somatic growth. In contrast, the molar dentition best reflects changes to the total growth period. Earlier initiation of molar mineralization, shorter crown formation times, less root length formed at gingival emergence into functional occlusion are cumulatively expressed as earlier ages at molar eruption. Things that are similar in modern humans and Pan, such as the total length of time taken to form individual teeth, raise expectations that these would also have been the same in fossil hominins. The best evidence there is from the youngest fossil hominin specimens suggests a close resemblance to the model for Pan but also hints that Gorilla may be a better developmental model for some. A mosaic of great ape-like features currently best describes the timing of early hominin dental development."

Here we report the results from inclusion of 12 additional, newly reported, specimens. The results are consistent with those of our original study and with the hypothesis that early hominid demographic success derived from a reproductive strategy involving male provisioning of pair-bonded females."

Central to the diagnosis of K. platyops is the morphology of the maxilla, characterized by a flat and relatively orthognathic subnasal region, anteriorly placed zygomatic processes and small molars. To study this morphology in more detail, we compare the maxillae of African Plio-Pleistocene hominin fossils and samples of modern humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, using conventional and geometric morphometric methods. Computed tomography scans and detailed preparation of the KNM-WT 40000 maxilla enable comprehensive assessment of post-mortem changes, so that landmark data characterizing the morphology can be corrected for distortion. Based on a substantially larger comparative sample than previously available, the results of statistical analyses show that KNM-WT 40000 is indeed significantly different from and falls outside the known range of variation of species of Australopithecus and Paranthropus, contemporary Australopithecus afarensis in particular. These results support the attribution of KNM-WT 40000 to a separate species and the notion that hominin taxonomic diversity in Africa extends back well into the Middle Pliocene."
Monkeys and Apes: Are Their Cognitive Skills Really So Different?,"['Amici, F', 'Aureli, F', 'Call, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21305,OCT 2010,21,"Differences in cognitive skills across taxa, and between monkeys and apes in particular, have been explained by different hypotheses, although these often are not supported by systematic interspecific comparisons. Here, we directly compared the cognitive performance of the four great apes and three monkey species (spider monkeys, capuchin monkeys, and long-tailed macaques), differing in their phylogenetic-relatedness and socioecology. We tested subjects on their ability to remember object locations (memory task), track object displacements (transposition task), and obtain out-of-reach rewards (support task). Our results showed no support for an overall clear-cut distinction in cognitive skills between monkeys and apes as species performance varied substantially across tasks. Although we found differences in performance at tracking object displacements between monkeys and apes, interspecific differences in the other two tasks were better explained in terms of differential socioecology, especially differential levels of fission-fusion dynamics. A cluster analysis using mean scores of each condition of the three tasks for each species suggested that the only dichotomy might be between members of the genus Pan and the rest of the tested species. These findings evidence the importance of using multiple tasks across multiple species in a comparative perspective to test different explanations for the enhancement of specific cognitive skills.

"Behavioral Responses of One Western Lowland Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) Group at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic, to Tourists, Researchers and Trackers","['Klailova, M', 'Hodgkinson, C', 'Lee, PC']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20829,OCT 2010,12,"Gorilla tourism, widely perceived as a lucrative industry, is propelled by strong market demand with programs in five countries and for three of four gorilla subspecies. Human presence may negatively affect wild gorillas, potentially lowering immunity and increasing the likelihood of acquiring human-borne disease. Yet, behavioral impacts of humans on wild gorilla behavior remain largely unexplored, particularly for western lowland gorillas. We evaluate the impact of tourist presence, human observer numbers (tourists, trackers, and researchers), and human observer distance on the behavior of one habituated gorilla group at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic. Behavioral data were collected for more than 12 months from January 2007. Of silverback aggressive events, 39% (N = 229) were human directed, but 65% were low-level soft barks. Adult females, and one in particular, were responsible for the highest number of aggressive events toward humans. Humans maintained closer proximity to the silverback when tourists were present, although tourist numbers had no significant impact on overall group activity budgets or rates of human-directed aggression. However, as research team size increased, group feeding rates decreased. Close observer-silverback distance correlated with a decrease in his feeding rates and an increase in human monitoring. He directed less aggression toward observers at distances 410 m, although observers spent 48.5% of time between 6 and 10 m of the silverback. We discuss gorilla personality as a factor in human-directed aggression. We explore whether the current 7 m distance limit governing gorilla tourism, based on disease transmission risks, is sufficient considering the potential behavioral stressor of close human presence. We recommend increasing minimum observation distance to >10 m where possible, decreasing observer group sizes, particularly after a visit consisting of maximum numbers and restricting tourist access to 1 visit/day.

Chromosomal Dynamics in Cercopithecini Studied by Williams-Beuren probe mapping,"['Dumas, F', 'Sineo, L']",CARYOLOGIA,NA,OCT-DEC 2010,1,"Chromosomal evolution in the tribe Cercopithecini and in related taxa is highly debated. Uncertainty in reconstruction is mainly related to the great genetic variability and polymorphism of the taxa. Recent molecular and karyological efforts individuate a split between genetically conservative, arbitrarily defined, ""terrestrial"" guenons and vervets, and genetically variable and derived ""arboreal"" guenons. We performed the mapping of WS loci probe (7q11.23) in order to verify the chromosomal dynamics of the genomes of three tree-dwelling species of the tribe: C. neglectus, C. mitis mitis, C. albogularis labiatus. Data from literature for the ground-dwelling"" Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus has been compared with our results.

The distribution of the WS probe showed a high genomic dynamics in the different species, with three different pattern of rearrangements. Starting from the ancestral synteny 7 found in Pongo pygmaeus (PPY), the present mapping demonstrates different location of the hybridizations signals. A parsimonious interpretation lead to the hypothesis that a pericentric inversion transformed the PPY orthologous in C. neglectus. The C. mitis and the strictly related C. a. labiatus demonstrate more complex, and derivative, rearrangements. According to the position of the WS signal, and to banding pattern analysis, C. mitis and C. albogoularis, underwent to the pericentric inversion, followed by a paracentric inversion and a successive interstitial fission that fragmented the synteny. Starting from the PPY like orthologous a single and independent event, a centric fission, that did not affect the WS position, occurred in Ch. aethiops producing a Gorilla gorilla like chromosome.

Our results confirm the hypothesis that chromosomal dynamics in Cercopithecini proceed by fissions and inversions and indicate the usefulness of the locus specific mapping approach for the identification of intrachromosome rearrangements."

We assessed the composition of the parasite communities in sympatric native and introduced primates. Over a 3-yr period we monitored the gastrointestinal parasites of 3 primate species living in the isolated ecosystem of Rubondo Island National Park, Tanzania: translocated chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and guerezas (Colobus guereza) and the indigenous vervets (Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus). We detected Troglodytella abrassarti and Enterobius cf. anthropopitheci only in chimpanzees and Chilomastix mesnili in chimpanzees and guerezas. In vervets, we recorded Anatrichosoma sp. and Subulura sp., previously reported in Rubondo chimpanzees. We found Blastocystis sp., Giardia sp., Iodamoeba buetschlii, Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba spp., Trichuris sp., Strongyloides spp., spirurids (cf. Protospirura muricola), and undetermined strongylids in all 3 primate species. Considering the absence of Protospirura muricola in other wild populations of chimpanzees and guerezas, it has probably been acquired from the native vervets, as have Anatrichosoma sp. and Subulura sp. Lower parasite load in Rubondo chimpanzees, in comparison with wild populations at other study sites of this species, might be due to their stay in captivity in Europe before being released on the island. Despite a lack of any apparent health problems from infections in introduced Rubondo primates, parasite monitoring during reintroduction/introduction projects is necessary to decrease potential risks resulting from the exchange of parasites between translocated and native species."
Great Apes Select Tools on the Basis of Their Rigidity,"['Manrique, HM', 'Gross, ANM', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-ANIMAL BEHAVIOR PROCESSES,10.1037/a0019296,OCT 2010,15,"Wild chimpanzees select tools according to their rigidity. However, little is known about whether choices are solely based on familiarity with the materials or knowledge about tool properties. Furthermore, it is unclear whether tool manipulation is required prior to selection or whether observation alone can suffice. We investigated whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) (n = 9). bonobos (Pan paniscus)(n = 4), orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) (n = 6), and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) (n = 2) selected new tools on the basis of their rigidity. Subjects faced an out-of-reach reward and a choice of three tools differing in color, diameter, material, and rigidity. We used 10 different 3-tool sets ( I rigid, 2 flexible). Subjects were unfamiliar with the tools and needed to select and use the rigid tool to retrieve the reward. Experiment I showed that subjects chose the rigid tool from the first trial with a 90% success rate. Experiments 2a and 2b addressed the role of manipulation and observation in tool selection. Subjects performed equally well in conditions in which they could manipulate the tools themselves or saw the experimenter manipulate the tools but decreased their performance if they could only visually inspect the tools. Experiment 3 showed that subjects could select flexible tools (as opposed to rigid ones) to meet new task demands. We conclude that great apes spontaneously selected unfamiliar rigid or flexible tools even after gathering minimal observational information."
Humans Differ from Other Hominids in Lacking an Activating NK Cell Receptor That Recognizes the C1 Epitope of MHC Class I,"['Moesta, AK', 'Graef, T', 'Abi-Rached, L', 'Aguilar, AMO', 'Guethlein, LA', 'Parham, P']",JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY,10.4049/jimmunol.1001951,OCT 1 2010,39,"Modulation of human NK cell function by killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIR) and MHC class I is dominated by the bipartite interactions of inhibitory lineage III KIR with the C1 and C2 epitopes of HLA-C. In comparison, the ligand specificities and functional contributions of the activating lineage III KIR remain poorly understood. Using a robust, sensitive assay of KIR binding and a representative panel of 95 HLA class I targets, we show that KIR2DS1 binds C2 with similar to 50% the avidity of KIR2DL1, whereas KIR2DS2, KIR2DS3, and KIR2DS5 have no detectable avidity for C1, C2, or any other HLA class I epitope. In contrast, the chimpanzee has activating C1- and C2-specific lineage III KIR with strong avidity, comparable to those of their paired inhibitory receptors. One variant of chimpanzee Pt-KIR3DS2, the activating C2-specific receptor, has the same avidity for C2 as does inhibitory Pt-KIR3DL4, and a second variant has similar to 73% the avidity. Chimpanzee Pt-KIR3DS6, the activating C1-specific receptor, has avidity for C1 that is similar to 70% that of inhibitory Pt-KIR2DL6. In both humans and chimpanzees we observe an evolutionary trend toward reducing the avidity of the activating C1- and C2-specific receptors through selective acquisition of attenuating substitutions. However, the extent of attenuation has been extreme in humans, as exemplified by KIR2DS2, an activating C1-specific receptor that has lost all detectable avidity for HLA class I. Supporting such elimination of activating C1-specific receptors as a uniquely human phenomenon is the presence of a high-avidity activating C1-specific receptor (Gg-KIR2DSa) in gorilla.

Medical and surgical management of reproductive neoplasia in two western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Stringer, EM', 'De Voe, RS', 'Valea, F', 'Toma, S', 'Mulvaney, G', 'Pruitt, A', 'Troan, B', 'Loomis, MR']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1111/j.1600-0684.2010.00414.x,OCT 2010,2,"Background

Reports of female reproductive tract neoplasia are infrequent in great apes.

Methods

Two captive-born, female western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) housed at the North Carolina Zoological Park were diagnosed with reproductive neoplasia.

Results

The first gorilla had uterine endometrial thickening and uterine fibroids diagnosed during a routine annual examination. Subsequently, the animal underwent several uterine curettage procedures in an attempt to debulk the uterine mass. Biopsy results indicated uterine adenocarcinoma. The animal was treated with an ovariohysterectomy followed by a combination of megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate. The second gorilla was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina, cervix, and uterus after presenting for intermittent vaginal bleeding of 1-month duration. This animal underwent palliative radiation therapy, receiving two rounds of radiation treatment 8 weeks apart.

Conclusions

The following report describes the diagnosis and management of the two cases."
"Widespread Infection with Homologues of Human Parvoviruses B19, PARV4, and Human Bocavirus of Chimpanzees and Gorillas in the Wild","['Sharp, CP', 'LeBreton, M', 'Kantola, K', 'Nana, A', 'Diffo, JL', 'Djoko, CF', 'Tamoufe, U', 'Kiyang, JA', 'Babila, TG', 'Ngole, EM', 'Pybus, OG', 'Delwart, E', 'Delaporte, E', 'Peeters, M', 'Soderlund-Venermo, M', 'Hedman, K', 'Wolfe, ND', 'Simmonds, P']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.01304-10,OCT 2010,45,"Infections with human parvoviruses B19 and recently discovered human bocaviruses (HBoVs) are widespread, while PARV4 infections are transmitted parenterally and prevalent specifically in injecting drug users and hemophiliacs. To investigate the exposure and circulation of parvoviruses related to B19 virus, PARV4, and HBoV in nonhuman primates, plasma samples collected from 73 Cameroonian wild-caught chimpanzees and gorillas and 91 Old World monkey (OWM) species were screened for antibodies to recombinant B19 virus, PARV4, and HBoV VP2 antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moderate to high frequencies of seroreactivity to PARV4 (63% and 18% in chimpanzees and gorillas, respectively), HBoV (73% and 36%), and B19 virus (8% and 27%) were recorded for apes, while OWMs were uniformly negative (for PARV4 and B19 virus) or infrequently reactive (3% for HBoV). For genetic characterization, plasma samples and 54 fecal samples from chimpanzees and gorillas collected from Cameroonian forest floors were screened by PCR with primers conserved within Erythrovirus, Bocavirus, and PARV4 genera. Two plasma samples (chimpanzee and baboon) were positive for PARV4, while four fecal samples were positive for HBoV-like viruses. The chimpanzee PARV4 variant showed 18% and 15% nucleotide sequence divergence in NS and VP1/2, respectively, from human variants (9% and 7% amino acid, respectively), while the baboon variant was substantially more divergent, mirroring host phylogeny. Ape HBoV variants showed complex sequence relationships with human viruses, comprising separate divergent homologues of HBoV1 and the recombinant HBoV3 species in chimpanzees and a novel recombinant species in gorillas. This study provides the first evidence for widespread circulation of parvoviruses in primates and enables future investigations of their epidemiology, host specificity, and (co)evolutionary histories."
The adaptive significance of unproductive alternative splicing in primates,"['Skandalis, A', 'Frampton, M', 'Seger, J', 'Richards, MH']",RNA-A PUBLICATION OF THE RNA SOCIETY,10.1261/rna.2127910,OCT 2010,12,"Alternative gene splicing is pervasive in metazoa, particularly in humans, where the majority of genes generate splice variant transcripts. Characterizing the biological significance of alternative transcripts is methodologically difficult since it is impractical to assess thousands of splice variants as to whether they actually encode proteins, whether these proteins are functional, or whether transcripts have a function independent of protein synthesis. Consequently, to elucidate the functional significance of splice variants and to investigate mechanisms underlying the fidelity of mRNA splicing, we used an indirect approach based on analyzing the evolutionary conservation of splice variants among species. Using DNA polymerase beta as an indicator locus, we cloned and characterized the types and frequencies of transcripts generated in primary cell lines of five primate species. Overall, we found that in addition to the canonical DNA polymerase b transcript, there were 25 alternative transcripts generated, most containing premature terminating codons. We used a statistical method borrowed from community ecology to show that there is significant diversity and little conservation in alternative splicing patterns among species, despite high sequence similarity in the underlying genomic (exonic) sequences. However, the frequency of alternative splicing at this locus correlates well with life history parameters such as the maximal longevity of each species, indicating that the alternative splicing of unproductive splice variants may have adaptive significance, even if the specific RNA transcripts themselves have no function. These results demonstrate the validity of the phylogenetic conservation approach in elucidating the biological significance of alternative splicing."

Here we develop a single-genome amplification strategy to identify and characterize Plasmodium spp. DNA sequences in faecal samples from wild-living apes. Among nearly 3,000 specimens collected from field sites throughout central Africa, we found Plasmodium infection in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), but not in eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei) or bonobos (Pan paniscus). Ape plasmodial infections were highly prevalent, widely distributed and almost always made up of mixed parasite species. Analysis of more than 1,100 mitochondrial, apicoplast and nuclear gene sequences from chimpanzees and gorillas revealed that 99% grouped within one of six host-specific lineages representing distinct Plasmodium species within the subgenus Laverania. One of these from western gorillas comprised parasites that were nearly identical to P. falciparum. In phylogenetic analyses of full-length mitochondrial sequences, human P. falciparum formed a monophyletic lineage within the gorilla parasite radiation. These findings indicate that P. falciparum is of gorilla origin and not of chimpanzee, bonobo or ancient human origin."
Censusing the mountain gorillas in the Virunga Volcanoes: complete sweep method versus monitoring,"['Gray, M', 'McNeilage, A', 'Fawcett, K', 'Robbins, MM', 'Ssebide, B', 'Mbula, D', 'Uwingeli, P']",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-2028.2009.01142.x,SEP 2010,5,"The mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) of the Virunga Volcanoes Range of Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo are one of the most endangered ape populations in the world. Following a dramatic decline during the 1960s, and relative stability in the 1970s, the population steadily increased during the 1980s. Due to political instability and war, a complete census had not been conducted since 1989. Here we compare the results of a complete census using the 'sweep method' conducted in 2003 with those from a monitoring program, to estimate the size and distribution of the gorilla population. A total of 360 gorillas were counted from census measurements and known habituated groups. Based on quantitative assessments of the census accuracy, we calculated that an additional 20 gorillas were not counted, leading to an estimated population of 380 individuals, and a 1.15% annual growth rate since 1989. The Ranger Based Monitoring programme yielded similar results. The encouraging results must be viewed with caution, however, because the growth was concentrated almost entirely in one section of the Virungas. Additionally, the distribution of gorilla groups was negatively correlated with the frequency of human disturbances, which highlights the need to continue strengthening conservation efforts.Resume

Les gorilles de montagne Gorilla gorilla beringei de l'aire de repartition des Volcans Virunga, au Rwanda, en Ouganda et en Republique Democratique du Congo, sont une des populations de grands singes les plus menacees du monde. Apres un declin dramatique dans le courant des annees 1960, et une stabilite relative dans les annees 1970, la population s'est fermement reconstituee au cours des annees 1980. Mais en raison de l'instabilite politique et de la guerre, il n'y avait plus eu de recensement total depuis 1989. Nous comparons ici les resultats d'un recensement complet effectue en 2003 par la methode du balayage topologique (sweep method) avec ceux d'un programme de suivi, afin d'estimer la taille et la distribution de la population de gorilles. Nous avons denombre un total de 360 gorilles en reprenant les chiffres du recensement et ceux des groupes habitues connus. En nous basant sur l'evaluation quantitative de la precision du recensement, nous avons calcule que 20 gorilles supplementaires n'avaient pas ete comptes, ce qui porte l'estimation a 380 individus et signifie un taux de croissance annuel de 1,15% depuis 1989. Le Programme de Suivi base sur les gardes a obtenu des resultats comparables. Pourtant, ces resultats encourageants doivent etre interpretes avec prudence etant donne que la croissance s'est presque entierement concentree sur une seule section des Virunga. De plus, la distribution des groupes de gorilles etait negativement liee a la frequence des perturbations humaines, ce qui souligne la necessite de poursuivre le renforcement des mesures de conservation."
Do apes know that they could be wrong?,"['Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-010-0317-x,SEP 2010,41,"When confronted with uncertain or incomplete information in decision-making situations, monkeys and apes opt for either escaping the situation or seeking additional information. These responses have been interpreted as evidence of metacognitive abilities. However, this interpretation has been challenged. On the one hand, studies using the information-seeking paradigm have been criticized because subjects may simply engage in a search for information routine (e.g., search until spot the reward) without any metacognitive involvement. On the other hand, studies using the escape response paradigm have been criticized because subjects may not recognize their own state of uncertainty but have learned to use the escape response in the presence of certain stimuli configurations that create uncertainty. The current study attempted to address these two criticisms by presenting great apes (seven gorillas, eight chimpanzees, four bonobos, seven orangutans) with a seeking information task whose basic procedure consisted of presenting two hollow tubes, baiting one of them and letting subjects choose. Conditions varied depending on whether subjects had visual access to the baiting, the cost associated with seeking information, the time interval between baiting and choosing, the food quality and the additional information offered regarding the food's location. Although subjects showed a high retrieval accuracy when they had witnessed the baiting, they were more likely to check inside the tube before choosing when high stakes were involved (Experiment 3) or after a longer period of time had elapsed between the baiting and the retrieval of the reward (Experiment 2). In contrast, providing subjects with indirect auditory information about the food's location or increasing the cost of checking reduced checking before choosing (Experiment 1). Taken together, these findings suggest that subjects knew that they could be wrong when choosing."
SURGICAL IMPLANTATION OF A CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY DEVICE IN A WESTERN LOWLAND GORILLA (GORILLA GORILLA GORILLA) WITH FIBROSING CARDIOMYOPATHY,"['Rush, EM', 'Ogburn, AL', 'Hall, J', 'Rush, D', 'Lau, Y', 'Dillon, AR', 'Garmon, L', 'Tillson, DM', 'Kay, GN']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/2008-0144.1,SEP 2010,2,"A 24-yr-old, male western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) was diagnosed in March of 2003 with congestive heart failure (CH F). Transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated global left and right ventricular hypokinesia with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.20. At the time of diagnosis, the animal exhibited symptoms and signs of CHF with minimal exertion (New York Heart Association class III). Over a 16-mo period, the severity of CHF progressed to class IV (resting signs and symptoms) despite angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, beta-blockers, and diuretics. Because of intractable CHF and a QRS duration that was markedly prolonged compared with the normal range for this species, a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device was implanted using implantation techniques based on human surgical procedures. Placement of the right ventricular, right atrial, and left ventricular leads and pulse generator were accomplished in 5.5 hr. Telemetry of the device postoperatively via wand or remote radio frequency has allowed for noninvasive programming and interrogation. The clinical improvement in CHF with this therapy was immediate and dramatic for this animal. Six months after CRT device implantation, the device leads became dislodged during an altercation with another gorilla, with the rapid development of CHF upon cessation of biventricular pacing. A second procedure to replace the leads returned the gorilla to his previous level of activity. in 2007, the pulse generator was electively replaced for battery depletion with a device capable of remote radiofrequency programming and interrogation. CRT implantation, although requiring specialized equipment and surgical skill, appears to be a viable option for treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy in gorillas."

The evolution of HIV-1 and the origin of AIDS,"['Sharp, PM', 'Hahn, BH']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2010.0031,AUG 27 2010,71,"The major cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We have been using evolutionary comparisons to trace (i) the origin(s) of HIV-1 and (ii) the origin(s) of AIDS. The closest relatives of HIV-1 are simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting wild-living chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in west central Africa. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed the origins of HIV-1: chimpanzees were the original hosts of this clade of viruses; four lineages of HIV-1 have arisen by independent cross-species transmissions to humans and one or two of those transmissions may have been via gorillas. However, SIVs are primarily monkey viruses: more than 40 species of African monkeys are infected with their own, species-specific, SIV and in at least some host species, the infection seems non-pathogenic. Chimpanzees acquired from monkeys two distinct forms of SIVs that recombined to produce a virus with a unique genome structure. We have found that SIV infection causes CD4(+) T-cell depletion and increases mortality in wild chimpanzees, and so the origin of AIDS is more ancient than the origin of HIV-1. Tracing the genetic changes that occurred as monkey viruses adapted to infect first chimpanzees and then humans may provide insights into the causes of the pathogenicity of these viruses."
Differences in the Cognitive Skills of Bonobos and Chimpanzees,"['Herrmann, E', 'Hare, B', 'Call, J', 'Tomasello, M']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0012438,AUG 27 2010,45,"While bonobos and chimpanzees are both genetically and behaviorally very similar, they also differ in significant ways. Bonobos are more cautious and socially tolerant while chimpanzees are more dependent on extractive foraging, which requires tools. The similarities suggest the two species should be cognitively similar while the behavioral differences predict where the two species should differ cognitively. We compared both species on a wide range of cognitive problems testing their understanding of the physical and social world. Bonobos were more skilled at solving tasks related to theory of mind or an understanding of social causality, while chimpanzees were more skilled at tasks requiring the use of tools and an understanding of physical causality. These species differences support the role of ecological and socio-ecological pressures in shaping cognitive skills over relatively short periods of evolutionary time."

In this study we quantify the antero/posterior (A/P) position of the mental foramen across great apes, modern humans and Australopithecus. Contrary to most qualitative assessments, we find significant differences between some extant hominoid species in mental foramen A/P position supporting its potential usefulness as a character for taxonomic and phylogenetic analyses of fossil hominoids. Gorilla gorilla, particularly the eastern subspecies, with a comparatively longer dental arcade and fossil and extant hominins with reduced canines and incisors tend to exhibit more anteriorly positioned mental foramina. Conversely, Pan troglodytes exhibits more posteriorly positioned mental foramina. Variation in this character among Gorilla gorilla subspecies supports recent taxonomic assessments that separate eastern and western populations. In all taxa other than Pan troglodytes the A/P position of the mental foramen is positively allometric with respect to dental arcade length. Thus, within each of these species, specimens with longer dental arcades tend to have more posteriorly positioned mental foramina. Those species with greater sexual dimorphism in canine size and dental arcade length (i.e., Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus) exhibit more extreme differences between smaller and larger individuals. Moreover, among great apes those individuals with greater anterior convergence of the dental arcade tend to exhibit more posteriorly positioned mental foramina. Dental arcade length, canine crown area and anterior convergence are all significantly associated with mental foramen A/P position, suggesting that these traits may influence taxonomic variation in the A/P position of the mental foramen.

There is no data for this species from Cameroon. To date few cases of active HBV infection have been documented in gorillas and only one complete HBV sequence has been described from a wild-caught gorilla originating from Cameroon and housed in Germany. Since gorillas are apes found in Cameroon, we thus investigated the prevalence and genetic relationships of HBV infecting apes in this area. We subjected 185 wild-caught apes' plasmas, including 159 from chimpanzees and 26 from gorillas to ELISA screening for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). Subsequently, we detected HBV DNA, sequenced the whole HBV genome and performed phylogenetic analysis. Eleven (6.9%) chimpanzees and 3 (11.6%) gorillas plasma were found HBsAg positive, of which 8 and 3 were positive for HBV DNA, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the 3 new gorilla HBV sequences grouped together with the single available HBV sequence from gorilla. Evidence of recombination between HBV Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Pan troglodytes vellerosus was observed in two of the Cameroonian strains. Findings from our study show that HBV infection is endemic in wild-born gorillas and chimpanzees in Cameroon, and that there is evidence of recombination between HBV strains circulating in chimpanzees. We demonstrated the existence of gorillas' specific HBV strains distinct but related to those found in chimpanzees living in the same habitat in Cameroon, providing substantial evidence of species association of HBV in NHPs.

In this study, we approach the problem by quantifying properties of internal bone architecture that may reflect different loading patterns in metatarsophalangeal joints in humans and great apes. High-resolution x-ray computed tomography data were collected for first and second metatarsal heads of Homo sapiens (n = 26), Pan paniscus (n = 17), Pan troglodytes (n = 19), Gorilla gorilla (n = 16), and Pongo pygmaeus (n = 20). Trabecular bone fabric structure was analyzed in three regions of each metatarsal head. While bone volume fraction did not significantly differentiate human and great ape trabecular bone structure, human metatarsal heads generally show significantly more anisotropic trabecular bone architectures, especially in the dorsal regions compared to the corresponding areas of the great ape metatarsal heads. The differences in anisotropy between humans and great apes support the hypothesis that trabecular architecture in the dorsal regions of the human metatarsals are indicative of a forefoot habitually used for propulsion during gait. This study provides a potential route for predicting forefoot function and gait in fossil hominins from metatarsal head trabecular bone architecture. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Phylogenetic analysis using complete capsid and non structural (NS) gene sequence suggested that the new parvovirus is most closely related to human bocaviruses (HBoV). However, the NS ORF is more similar in length to the NS ORF found in canine minute virus and bovine parvovirus than in HBoV. Comparative genetic analysis using GBoV and HBoV genomes enabled characterization of unique splice donor and acceptor sites that appear to be highly conserved among all four HBoV species, and provided evidence for expression of two different NS proteins in all primate bocaviruses. GBoV is the first non-human primate bocavirus identified and provides new insights into the genetic diversity and evolution of this highly prevalent and recently discovered group of parvoviruses."
Dental and phylogeographic patterns of variation in gorillas,"['Pilbrow, V', 'GRAUERS GORILLA']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.01.009,JUL 2010,6,"Gorilla patterns of variation have great relevance for studies of human evolution. In this study, molar morphometrics were used to evaluate patterns of geographic variation in gorillas. Dental specimens of 323 adult individuals, drawn from the current distribution of gorillas in equatorial Africa were divided into 14 populations. Discriminant analyses and Mahalanobis distances were used to study population structure.

Results reveal that: 1) the West and East African gorillas form distinct clusters, 2) the Cross River gorillas are well separated from the rest of the western populations, 3) gorillas from the Virunga mountains and the Bwindi Forest can be differentiated from the lowland gorillas of Utu and Mwenga-Fizi, 4) the Tshiaberimu gorillas are distinct from other eastern gorillas, and the Kahuzi-Biega gorillas are affiliated with them. These findings provide support for a species distinction between Gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei, with subspecies G. g. diehli, G. g. gorilla, G. b. graueri, G. b. beringei, and possibly, G. b. rex-pygmaeorum. Clear correspondence between dental and other patterns of taxonomic diversity demonstrates that dental data reveal underlying genetic patterns of differentiation.

Dental distances increased predictably with altitude but not with geographic distances, indicating that altitudinal segregation explains gorilla patterns of population divergence better than isolation-by-distance. The phylogeographic pattern of gorilla dental metric variation supports the idea that Plio-Pleistocene climatic fluctuations and local mountain building activity in Africa affected gorilla phylogeography. I propose that West Africa comprised the historic center of gorilla distribution and experienced drift-gene flow equilibrium, whereas Nigeria and East Africa were at the periphery, where climatic instability and altitudinal variation promoted drift and genetic differentiation. This understanding of gorilla population structure has implications for gorilla conservation, and for understanding the distribution of sympatric chimpanzees and Plio-Pleistocene hominins.

"Endocranial shape asymmetries in Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla assessed via skull based landmark analysis","['Balzeau, A', 'Gilissen, E']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.03.013,JUL 2010,16,"Brain shape asymmetries or petalias consist of the extension of one cerebral hemisphere beyond the other. A larger frontal or caudal projection is usually coupled with a larger lateral extent of the more projecting hemisphere relative to the other. The concurrence of these petalial components is characteristic of hominins. Studies aimed at quantifying petalial asymmetries in human and great ape endocasts rely on the definition of the midline of the endocranial surface. Studies of brain material show that, at least in humans, most of the medial surface of the left occipital lobe distorts along the midline and protrudes on to the right side, making it difficult for midline and corresponding left and right reference point identification. In order to accurately quantify and compare brain shape asymmetries in extant hominid species, we propose here a new protocol based on the objective definition of cranial landmarks. We describe and quantify for the first time in three dimensions the positions of frontal and occipital protrusions in large samples of Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla. This study confirms the existence of frontal and occipital petalias in African apes. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the 3D structure of these petalias reveals shared features, as well as features that are unique to the different great ape species. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Fourteen adults (nine females, five males) were found in two different non-natal groups as adults. In addition, one male and one female that became dominant and reproduced in their natal group later transferred to a second group, and one female was known to be a tertiary transfer. Data from the seven tracked social groups indicate that 35% of all the males and 29% of all the females were potential secondary transfers. In these groups, males leaving or joining was not associated with group size or absolute number of females. Females leaving or joining was not associated with group size or absolute number of males, but females left groups with more females and joined groups with fewer females. Both sexes left groups with unfavorable sex ratios for their sex and joined groups with sex ratios more favorable for their sex. Since a favorable sex ratio is associated with reproductive success in other howler populations, this suggests secondary transfer as a reproductive strategy. Other factors could also influence secondary transfer."
Handedness in captive gorillas (Gorilla gorilla),"['Harrison, RM', 'Nystrom, P']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-010-0191-9,JUL 2010,8,"Species-level right handedness is frequently presented as a marker of human uniqueness. Handedness also has implications for the evolution of language and cognition. In this study, we examined handedness in 22 captive gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) across a range of behaviours that were part of their daily routine. Ten individuals showed no preferences for any of the behaviours performed, and the majority of the remaining individuals showed a preference for only one behaviour. These results lend support to the theory that species-level handedness is unique to humans. It is hoped that these results will contribute to investigations into the evolution of handedness, which can ultimately be used to further our understanding of the evolution of human language and cognition."

African apes as reservoirs of Plasmodium falciparum and the origin and diversification of the Laverania subgenus,"['Duval, L', 'Fourment, M', 'Nerrienet, E', 'Rousset, D', 'Sadeuh, SA', 'Goodman, SM', 'Andriaholinirina, NV', 'Randrianarivelojosia, M', 'Paul, RE', 'Robert, V', 'Ayala, FJ', 'Ariey, F']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.1005435107,JUN 8 2010,75,"We investigated two mitochondrial genes (cytb and cox1), one plastid gene (tufA), and one nuclear gene (ldh) in blood samples from 12 chimpanzees and two gorillas from Cameroon and one lemur from Madagascar. One gorilla sample is related to Plasmodium falciparum, thus confirming the recently reported presence in gorillas of this parasite. The second gorilla sample is more similar to the recently defined Plasmodium gaboni than to the P. falciparum-Plasmodium reichenowi clade, but distinct from both. Two chimpanzee samples are P. falciparum. A third sample is P. reichenowi and two others are P. gaboni. The other chimpanzee samples are different from those in the ape clade: two are Plasmodium ovale, and one is Plasmodium malariae. That is, we have found three human Plasmodium parasites in chimpanzees. Four chimpanzee samples were mixed: one species was P. reichenowi; the other species was P. gaboni in three samples and P. ovale in the fourth sample. The lemur sample, provisionally named Plasmodium malagasi, is a sister lineage to the large cluster of primate parasites that does not include P. falciparum or ape parasites, suggesting that the falciparum + ape parasite cluster (Laverania clade) may have evolved from a parasite present in hosts not ancestral to the primates. If malignant malaria were eradicated from human populations, chimpanzees, in addition to gorillas, might serve as a reservoir for P. falciparum."

"Dental Wear, Wear Rate, and Dental Disease in the African Apes","['Elgart, AA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20797,JUN 2010,7,"The African apes possess thinner enamel than do other hominoids, and a certain amount of dentin exposure may be advantageous in the processing of tough diets eaten by Gorilla. Dental wear (attrition plus abrasion) that erodes the enamel exposes the underlying dentin and creates additional cutting edges at the dentin-enamel junction. Hypothetically, efficiency of food processing increases with junction formation until an optimal amount is reached, but excessive wear hinders efficient food processing and may lead to sickness, reduced fecundity, and death. Occlusal surfaces of molars and incisors in three populations each of Gorilla and Pan were videotaped and digitized. The quantity of incisal and molar occlusal dental wear and the lengths of dentin-enamel junctions were measured in 220 adult and 31 juvenile gorilla and chimpanzee skulls. Rates of dental wear were calculated in juveniles by scoring the degree of wear between adjacent molars M1 and M2. Differences were compared by principal (major) axis analysis. ANOVAs compared means of wear amounts. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to compare the relationship between molar wear and incidence of dental disease.

Results indicate that quantities of wear are significantly greater in permanent incisors and molars and juvenile molars of gorillas compared to chimpanzees. The lengths of dentin-enamel junctions were predominantly suboptimal. Western lowland gorillas have the highest quantities of wear and the most molars with suboptimal wear. The highest rates of wear are seen in Pan paniscus and Pan t. troglodytes, and the lowest rates are found in P.t. schweinfurthii and G. g. graueri. Among gorillas, G. b. beringei have the highest rates but low amounts of wear. Coefficients between wear and dental disease were low, but significant when all teeth were combined. Gorilla teeth are durable, and wear does not lead to mechanical senescence in this sample. Am. J. Primatol. 72:481-491, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Using Behavior to Determine Immature Life-Stages in Captive Western Gorillas,"['Hutchinson, JE', 'Fletcher, AW']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20799,JUN 2010,1,"Ontogenic development is divided into infant, juvenile, adolescent and adult life-stages. Although the developmental trajectory of an individual is a flexible entity, which differs within species, environment and sex, life-stage classifications are generally structured, age-based systems. This invariably leads to rigidity within a dynamic system and consequently hampers our understanding of primate life history strategies. We propose that life-stage classifications should be quantitative, flexible entities, which use a reliable measurement of development. Here, we provide a methodological example where placement into a life-stage is based upon behavioral variance between other similar-aged individuals. Behavioral data were collected from 12 male (3-11 years old) and 9 female (3-8 years old) captive immature western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) housed in five family groups, using continuous focal sampling; 900 hr of data were collected over 131 days. Data were applied to four published life-stage classifications for mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), which showed variable ability to determine life-stage in western gorillas. A new life-stage classification (Hutchinson & Fletcher) was proposed specifically for western gorillas, whereby multiple co-varying behavior provided a robust measure of linear development across immaturity. Each life-stage was found to be a distinct ontogenic phase and the classification discriminated life-stage with a high level of accuracy. Using the Hutchinson & Fletcher classification we provide evidence for disparity in developmental trajectories between the sexes from the juvenile period onwards. To expand the understanding of primate life histories, we propose that flexible classifications should be used to enable comparison of allometric life history traits within and between species, from birth onwards.

Horses fulfil a wide variety of roles for humans and have been domesticated for at least 5000 years but their ability to read human cues has not been widely studied. We tested the ability of 28 horses to attend to human-given cues in an object choice task. We included five different cues: distal sustained pointing, momentary tapping, marker placement, body orientation and gaze ( head) alternation. Horses were able to use the pointing and marker placement cues spontaneously but not the tapping, body orientation and gaze alternation cues. The overall pattern of responding suggests that horses may use cues that provide stimulus enhancement at the time of choice and do not have an understanding of the communicative nature of the cues given. As such, their proficiency at this task appears to be inferior to that of domestic dogs, Canis lupus familiaris, but similar to that of domestic goats, Caprus hircus.

Chimpanzees occur in 3 of the 5 protected areas in Guinea but their conservation status is unknown. We conducted a chimpanzee census in 2001-2002 in the Haut Niger National Park (HNNP), the largest protected area in the country. We counted nests along a total of 103.83 km of transects in the Mafou forest, 1 of the 2 core areas of the park. We recorded a total of 823 nests, of which 38.1% were located in gallery forests, although this habitat type covers only 4.2% of the study site. Using a site-specific mean nest decay rate of 194 days, we estimated the mean density of chimpanzees in the study area at 0.87 weaned individuals/kmA(2), the highest density recorded in any West African protected area. A survey conducted in 2008-2009 by other authors in the Mafou forest suggests that the chimpanzee population remained stable over the last 6 yr. Given the significance of the chimpanzee population of the HNNP at the national and international levels, we provide recommendations for its conservation over the long term. Our results highlight the importance of gallery forests as key habitat for chimpanzees in the savannah biome. We therefore recommend that more attention be paid to the conservation of this habitat in land management and conservation planning schemes. In particular, we recommend setting aside gallery forests as ecological corridors between nearby protected areas to maintain exchange between distant chimpanzee populations."

VALIDATION OF MULTIPLE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES TO DETECT CRYPTOSPORIDIUM SP AND GIARDIA SP IN FREE-RANGING WESTERN LOWLAND GORILLAS (GORILLA GORILLA GORILLA) AND OBSERVATIONS ON THE PREVALENCE OF THESE PROTOZOAN INFECTIONS IN TWO POPULATIONS IN GABON,"['Langhout, MV', 'Reed, P', 'Fox, M']",JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE,10.1638/2009-0051R1.1,JUN 2010,2,"Anthropozoonotic diseases threaten the survival of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Use of accurate diagnostic techniques in gorilla health monitoring contributes to the conservation of gorillas by providing robust information for appropriate management decisions. To identify suitable protozoa diagnostic techniques for wild gorillas, 95 fecal specimens were collected in Lope National Park and east of Moukalaba-Doudou National Park in Gabon, areas with high and low levels of human activity, respectively. The samples were examined for Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia sp. by using the following diagnostic techniques: a commercially available immunofluorescent antibody test kit, Merifluor, and a rapid immune-assay, ImmunoCard STAT!, to detect Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia sp., and a modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain to detect Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts. The results obtained from the Merifluor test, considered the ""gold standard"" in human studies, were used to estimate the prevalence of Cryptosporidium) sp. and Giardia sp. infections in Lope National Park (19.0% and 22.6%, respectively) and east of Moukalaba-Doudou National Park (0% and 9.1%, respectively). The difference in prevalence in both areas may be associated with differing levels of anthropogenic disturbance. The sensitivity and specificity of the latter two diagnostic techniques were calculated by using the Merifluor test as a control. The ImmunoCard STAT! was found suitable for Giardia sp. antigen detection (specific but not sensitive) and inappropriate for Cryptosporidium sp. antigen detection (not specific or sensitive). The modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain was found to be highly specific but not sensitive in the detection of Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts. These results underline the necessity of using ancillary tests and concentration methods to correctly identify positive samples. This is the first report of Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia sp. infections in free-ranging western lowland gorillas and highlights the importance of verifying the accuracy of diagnostic techniques developed for human use before applying these to non-human primates."

The subjects included free-ranging mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in the Pare National des Volcans, Rwanda, and a group of orphan mountain and Grauer's gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri) housed nearby in a temporary holding facility. Three collection methods were used to recover saliva from discarded forest food: swabbing, soaking, and washing. Saliva was also collected from orphan gorillas maintained in a captive setting by using dental ropes inside mesh bags. The presence of gorilla saliva in each sample was confirmed by using a salivary alpha-amylase assay and forensic press test paper. The recovery of gorilla DNA was verified by polymerase chain reaction by using primers specific to mountain and Grauer's gorillas. Of the three collection techniques used to recover saliva from forest food, directly swabbing plant bite marks was the most effective. Wild celery (Peucedanum linderi) provided for the most consistent saliva recovery and is eaten year round by mountain gorillas in Rwanda. This study shows that gorilla saliva can be recovered easily and noninvasively from known individual free-ranging gorillas by collecting pieces of wild celery discarded as the gorillas forage and from captive gorillas by offering them juice-soaked dental ropes inside mesh bags. Both methods can be used to recover gorilla DNA for genetic studies. Saliva collected from free-ranging and captive gorillas may prove to be a useful biologic sample for the development of new diagnostic tests and hormonal analysis."

We studied entodimomorphid ciliates in 23 captive groups of chimpanzees, three groups of captive bonobos and six populations of wild chimpanzees. Fecal samples were examined using Sheather's flotation and Merthiolate-Iodme-Formaldehyde Concentration (MIFC) methods. We quantified the number of ciliates per gram of feces The MIFC method was more sensitive for ciliate detection than the flotation method Ciliates of genus Troglodytella were detected in 13 groups of captive chimpanzees, two groups of bonobos and in all wild chimpanzee populations studied The absence of entodiniomorphids in some captive groups might be because of the extensive administration of chemotherapeutics in the past or a side-effect of the causative or prophylactic administration of antiparasitic or antibiotic drugs. The infection intensities of ciliates in captive chimpanzees were higher than in wild ones. We suppose that the over-supply of starch, typical in captive primate diets, might induce an increase in the number of ciliates In vitro studies on metabolism and biochemical activities of entodiniomorphids are needed to clarify their role in ape digestion.

We conducted three experiments with great apes to investigate strategy preferences and factors that may shape them. In the first experiment, we trained 17 apes to remember 12 different food locations on the floor of their sleeping room. The 12 food locations were associated with one feature cue, so that feature and spatial cues were confounded. In a single test session, we brought the cues into conflict and found that apes, irrespective of species, showed a preference for a feature strategy. In the second experiment, we used a similar procedure and trained 25 apes to remember one food location on a platform in front of them. On average, apes preferred to use a feature strategy but some individuals relied on a spatial strategy. In the final experiment, we investigated whether training might influence strategy preferences. We tested 21 apes in the platform set-up and found that apes used both, feature and spatial strategies irrespective of training. We conclude that apes can use feature and spatial strategies to remember the location of hidden food items, but that task demands (e.g. different numbers of search locations) can influence strategy preferences. We found no evidence, however, for the role of training in shaping these preferences."

To later locate such objects, the organism must maintain a representation of the object in memory and generate an expectation about where it will later appear. We explored adult dogs' knowledge and use of the solidity principle (that one solid object cannot pass through another solid object) by evaluating search behavior. Subjects watched as a treat rolled down an inclined tube into a box. The box either did or did not contain a solid wall dividing it in half. To find the treat, subjects had to modify their search behavior based on the presence or absence of the wall, which either did or did not block the treat's trajectory. Dogs correctly searched the near location when the barrier was present and the far location when the barrier was absent. They displayed this behavior from the first trial, as well as performed correctly when trial types were intermingled. These results suggest that dogs direct their searches in accordance with the solidity principle."
Individually Identifiable Body Odors Are Produced by the Gorilla and Discriminated by Humans,"['Hepper, PG', 'Wells, DL']",CHEMICAL SENSES,10.1093/chemse/bjq015,MAY 2010,6,"Many species produce odor cues that enable them to be identified individually, as well as providing other socially relevant information. Study of the role of odor cues in the social behavior of great apes is noticeable by its absence. Olfaction has been viewed as having little role in guiding behavior in these species. This study examined whether Western lowland gorillas produce an individually identifiable odor. Odor samples were obtained by placing cloths in the gorilla's den. A delayed matching to sample task was used with human participants (n = 100) to see if they were able to correctly match a target odor sample to a choice of either: 2 odors (the target sample and another, Experiment 1) and 6 odors (the target sample and 5 others, Experiment 2). Participants were correctly able to identify the target odor when given either 2 or 6 matches. Subjects made fewest errors when matching the odor of the silverback, whereas matching the odors of the young gorillas produced most errors. The results indicate that gorillas do produce individually identifiable body odors and introduce the possibility that odor cues may play a role in gorilla social behavior."
Unhealthy travelers present challenges to sustainable primate ecotourism,"['Muehlenbein, MP', 'Martinez, LA', 'Lemke, AA', 'Ambu, L', 'Nathan, S', 'Alsisto, S', 'Sakong, R']",TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE,10.1016/j.tmaid.2010.03.004,MAY 2010,11,"Background: Ecotourism can function as a powerful tool for species conservation. However, a significant proportion of travelers at wildlife sanctuaries may be ill and potentially infectious, creating unnecessary risk of pathogen transmission to wildlife.

Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to adult visitors at the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre, Sabah, Malaysia. The questionnaire recorded age, occupation, region of origin, history of recent travel, recent contact with livestock, domestic and wild animals, and diagnoses/symptoms of various infections.

Results: 15% of the 633 tourists self-reported at least one of the following current symptoms: cough, sore throat, congestion, fever, diarrhea and vomiting. Participants who reported recent animal contact were significantly more likely to report current respiratory symptoms compared to other participants. Likewise, participants with a medical-related occupation were more likely to report current respiratory symptoms while at Sepilok compared to other participants.

Conclusions: Despite being ill and potentially infectious, these tourists were visiting a wildlife sanctuary to view endangered species. Many of these visitors had animal contact immediately prior to arriving, and many had at least some basic knowledge about infection transmission. While participants in nature-based tourism are generally concerned about environmental protection, present analyses suggest that a significant proportion of ecotourists are uninformed of the risks they may pose to non-human animal health.

Landscape-scale conservation requires an evaluation of management impact on biodiversity under different land-use strategies; this is challenging and there exist few empirical studies. In a conservation landscape in northern Republic of Congo we demonstrate the application of a large-scale monitoring program designed to evaluate the impact of conservation interventions on three globally threatened species: western gorillas, chimpanzees and forest elephants, under three land-use types: integral protection, commercial logging, and community-based natural resource management. We applied distance-sampling methods to examine species abundance across different land-use types under varying degrees of management and human disturbance. We found no clear trends in abundance between land-use types. However, units with interventions designed to reduce poaching and protect habitats irrespective of land-use type - harboured all three species at consistently higher abundance than a neighbouring logging concession undergoing no wildlife management. We applied Generalized-Additive Models to evaluate a priori predictions of species response to different landscape processes. Our results indicate that, given adequate protection from poaching, elephants and gorillas can profit from herbaceous vegetation in recently logged forests and maintain access to ecologically important resources located outside of protected areas. However, proximity to the single integrally protected area in the landscape maintained an overriding positive influence on elephant abundance, and logging roads - even subject to anti-poaching controls - were exploited by elephant poachers and had a major negative influence on elephant distribution. Chimpanzees show a clear preference for unlogged or more mature forests and human disturbance had a negative influence on chimpanzee abundance, in spite of anti-poaching interventions. We caution against the pitfalls of missing and confounded co-variables in model-based estimation approaches and highlight the importance of spatial scale in the response of different species to landscape processes. We stress the importance of a stratified design-based approach to monitoring species status in response to conservation interventions and advocate a holistic framework for landscape-scale monitoring that includes smaller-scale targeted research and punctual assessment of threats."
"Are the Gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park ""True"" Mountain Gorillas?","['Elgart, AA']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21172,APR 2010,2,"The gorillas that inhabit Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda are the least known of the eastern gorillas. Because they are an allopatric population living a minimum of 25 km from the well-studied population of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in Rwanda and have certain morphological and ecological differences from these gorillas, their taxonomic status has been in question in recent years. This study presents new craniodental metrics from Bwindi individuals and compares them to Virunga individuals as well as to eastern lowland gorillas, G. gorilla graueri. Multivariate statistics, including MAN-COVA, least-squares, regression, and principal components analyses, were used to evaluate how closely the Bwindi crania resemble the Virunga crania and how both relate to G. g. graueri. Results indicate that the Bwindi gorillas have generally smaller crania than the Virunga gorillas, but when metrics are log-transformed, the only variable that distinguishes the Bwindi individuals is a longer face. When both populations are compared to G. g. graueri, they cluster together separately from the eastern lowland gorillas, sharing such features as higher rami, wider bigonia, longer mandibles, and wider and shorter mandibular symphyses in relation to G. g. graueri. Functional morphological explanations for these differences are discussed, but lacking measurements of the physical properties of G. g. graueri, they cannot fully be explained. Results clearly indicate that at least pertaining to the cranium, upon which most gorilla taxonomy is based, the Bwindi gorillas are proper mountain gorillas (G. b. beringei).

Oval in Males and Triangular in Females?

However, no demonstrations or detailed studies seem available in the literature. The purpose of this work was to study quantitatively this trait using Fourier analysis, because this methodological approach is particularly well adapted for discrimination between different simple shapes. Using this approach, an outline can be characterized by a series of harmonics (1 to n), each defined by two Fourier descriptors: amplitude (C(n)), describing the relative importance of the harmonic contribution to the original shape, and phase (Phi(n)), representing the orientation of the harmonic contribution. The material consisted of 104 three-dimensional CT reconstructions of adult pelves (52 males and 52 females). After size normalization, the outlines of the 104 left obturator foramens were studied. Significant differences were demonstrated with, in total, 84.6% of individuals presenting a correct inferred sex. The most discriminating descriptors were the phase of the second harmonic (C(2)), related to the oval (or elliptic) aspect and thus the elongation of the shape, and the amplitude of the third harmonic (Phi(3)), describing the triangularity of the shape. Because the trend for an outline to be more or less oval or triangular is difficult to visually assess and because there is an infinite number of transitional shapes, only a precise quantitative approach such as Fourier analysis allows for unambiguous characterization and statistical analysis.

Whether nonhuman primates exhibit population-level manual bias remains a controversial topic. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that bimanual coordinated activities may be a key-behavior in our ancestors for the emergence and evolution of human population-level right-handedness. To this end, we collected data on hand preferences in 35 captive gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) during simple unimanual reaching and for bimanual coordinated feeding. Unimanual reaching consisted of grasping food on the ground, while bimanual feeding consisted of using one hand for holding a food and processing the food item by the opposite hand. No population-level manual bias was found for unimanual actions but, in contrast, gorillas exhibited a significant population-level right-handedness for the bimanual actions. Moreover, the degree of right-handedness for bimanual feeding exceeds any other known reports of hand use in primates, suggesting that lateralization for bimanual feeding is robust in captive gorillas. The collective evidence is discussed in the context of potential continuity of handedness between human and nonhuman primates. Am J Phys Anthropol 141:638-645, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Great Apes Track Hidden Objects After Changes in the Objects' Position and in Subject's Orientation,"['Albiach-Serrano, A', 'Call, J', 'Barth, J']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20790,APR 2010,15,"Eight chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), five bonobos (Pan paniscus), five gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), and seven orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) were presented with two invisible object displacement tasks. In full view of the subject, a food item was hidden under one of three opaque cups resting on a platform and, after an experimental manipulation, the subject was allowed to select one of the cups. In the rotation task, the platform was rotated 1800 while the subject remained stationary. In the translocation task, the platform remained stationary while the subject walked to the opposite side from where she saw the reward being hidden. The final position of the food relative to the subject was equivalent in both tasks. Single displacement trials consisted of only one manipulation, either a rotation or a translocation, whereas double displacement trials consisted of both a rotation and a translocation. We also included no displacement trials in which no displacements took place. No displacement trials were easier than single displacements which, in turn, were easier than double displacements. Unlike earlier studies with children, there was no difference in performance between rotation and translocation displacements. Overall, apes performed above chance in all conditions, but chimpanzees outperformed the other species. This study reinforces the notion that the great apes use an allocentric spatial coding. Am. J.

Curvature Scaling in the Medial Tibial Condyle of Large Bodied Hominoids,"['Sylvester, AD', 'Organ, JM', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS']",ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,10.1002/ar.21126,APR 2010,3,"The shape of joint articular surfaces can provide important information about the locomotor habits of animals. Understanding sources of shape variation in these surfaces is critical to correctly inferring the link between form and function. This study tests the hypothesis that increases in body size within a species result in flatter joint contours of the joint articular surface. Joint flattening is expected to regulate the magnitude and direction of transarticular stresses passing through the joint. Three-dimensional laser scans of polyvinylsiloxane molds of the medial tibial condyle of gorillas (n = 40), common chimpanzees (n = 40), and modern humans (n = 40) were evaluated for differences in articular surface topography, with all measures of joint curvature examined in relation to femoral head superoinferior diameter (as a surrogate for body size). Analyses did not detect an allometric shape change in the curvature of the medial tibial condyle with increasing body size within any of the three taxa examined here. Medial tibial condyle curvature appears to be largely independent of body size as estimated by femoral head diameter. These results do not provide direct support for the hypothesis that joints become flatter in response to increased transarticular loading. Anat Rec, 293:671-679, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Specifically, the effect of intense human-induced noise during oil exploration on wildlife is poorly understood. We explore the effect of seismic oil exploration on large mammal distribution in an 80 km(2) area of Loango National Park, Gabon Following the ecological theory of habitat disturbance, we predicted that changes in habitat use in response to noise disturbance would scale with the body/home range size of each species examined Our study was conducted over six months before, during and after low-impact seismic operations We recorded counts along transects of indirect signs of elephants (Loxondota africana cyclotis), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), duikers (Cephalophus spp.), and the vocalizations of five monkey species (Cercocebus torquatus, Cercopithecus cephus, C. nictitans, C pogonias and Lophocebus albigena) and modeled seismic impact over different spatial scales (small, intermediate and large) We found that elephants avoided seismic activity on all three spatial scales, apes avoided on the intermediate and small scales, and there was no effect for duikers and monkeys. We conclude that low-impact seismic operations can cause considerable temporary habitat loss for species with large ranges and suggest that the impact on those endangered species can be minimized by adequately spacing seismic lines and activity in space and time to enable species to move away from the progressive noise disruption (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Identification of human specific gene duplications relative to other primates by array CGH and quantitative PCR,"['Armengol, G', 'Knuutila, S', 'Lozano, JJ', 'Madrigal, I', 'Caballin, MR']",GENOMICS,10.1016/j.ygeno.2010.02.003,APR 2010,4,"In order to identify human lineage specific (HLS) copy number differences (CNDs) compared to other primates, we performed pair wise comparisons (human vs. chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan) by using cDNA array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). A set of 23 genes with HLS duplications were identified, as well as other lineage differences in gene copy number specific of chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan. Each species has gained more copies of specific genes rather than losing gene copies. Eleven of the 23 genes have only been observed to have undergone HLS duplication in Fortna et al. (2004) and in the present study. Then, seven of these 11 genes were analyzed by quantitative PCR in chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan, as well as in other six primate species (Hylobates lar, Cercopithecus aethiops, Papio hamadryas, Macaca mulatta, Lagothrix lagothricha, and Saimiri sciureus). Six genes confirmed array CGH data, and four of them appeared to have bona fide HLS duplications (ABCB10, E2F6, CDH12, and TDG genes). We propose that these gene duplications have a potential to contribute to specific human phenotypes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Seasonal changes in food resource distribution and feeding sites selected by Japanese macaques on Koshima Islet, Japan","['Go, M']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-009-0179-5,APR 2010,10,"Feeding sites of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) change according to seasonal fluctuations in food resource distribution. To examine what characteristics of food items affect feeding site selection, I describe herein the seasonal changes in food items, feeding sites, and food resource distributions of this species. Feeding behavior of monkeys and their food resource distributions were investigated on Koshima Islet, southern Japan, for four study periods (i.e., seasons) in 2002. Monkeys showed large variations in their diet between seasons. To weigh the relative influence of the distribution and abundance of food items on feeding site selection in each season, multiple regression analyses were performed by 100 m x 100 m grid. In the analyses, feeding time was a dependent variable and the abundance of staple food items, for which feeding time was over 5% in each season, in each grid square was an independent variable. There was no correlation between the resource distribution of most food items and the distribution of feeding time by monkeys in each season. Monkeys spent more feeding time where multiple staple food items were available. Food items that affected feeding site selection by monkeys had the following three characteristics: (1) clumped distribution, (2) seasonal availability, and (3) fruit. This suggests that monkeys are likely to select feeding sites to consume food items whose availability is limited temporally and spatially, which may enable them to simultaneously use other widely distributed, abundant food items efficiently."
Comparative Anatomy of the Locus Coeruleus in Humans and Nonhuman Primates,"['Sharma, Y', 'Xu, T', 'Graf, WM', 'Fobbs, A', 'Sherwood, CC', 'Hof, PR', 'Allman, JM', 'Manaye, KF']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY,10.1002/cne.22249,APR 1 2010,6,"The locus coeruleus (LC) is a dense cluster of neurons that projects axons throughout the neuroaxis and is located in the rostral pontine tegmentum extending from the level of the inferior colliculus to the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. LC neurons are lost in the course of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In this study we used Nissl staining and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity to compare the human LC with that of closely related primate species, including great and lesser apes, and macaque monkeys. TH catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis. The number of TH-immunoreactive (TH-ir) neurons was estimated in each species using stereologic methods. In the LC of humans the mean total number of TH-ir neurons was significantly higher compared to the other primates. Because the total number of TH-ir neurons in the LC was highly correlated with the species mean volume of the medulla oblongata, cerebellum, and neocortical gray matter, we conclude that much of the observed phylogenetic variation can be explained by anatomical scaling. Notably, the total number of LC neurons in humans was most closely predicted by the nonhuman allometric scaling relationship relative to medulla size, whereas the number of LC neurons in humans was considerably lower than predicted according to neocortex and cerebellum volume.

It varies between three and four in extant African apes (mean = 3.5). Because both chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) possess the same distributions of thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae, it has been assumed from parsimony that the last common ancestor (LCA) of African apes and humans possessed a similarly short lower back. This ""short-backed LCA"" scenario has recently been viewed favorably in an analysis of the intra- and interspecific variation in axial formulas observed among African apes and humans (Pilbeam, 2004. J Exp Zool 30213:241-267). However, the number of bonobo (Pan paniscus) specimens in that study was small (N = 17). Here we reconsider vertebral type and number in the LCA in light of an expanded P. paniscus sample as well as evidence provided by the human fossil record. The precaudal (pre-coccygeal) axial column of bonobos differs from those of chimpanzees and gorillas in displaying one additional vertebra as well as significantly different combinations of sacral, lumbar, and thoracic vertebrae. These findings, along with the six-segmented lumbar column of early Australopithecus and early Homo, suggest that the LCA possessed a long axial column and long lumbar spine and that reduction in the lumbar column occurred independently in humans and in each ape clade, and continued after separation of the two species of Pan as well. Such an explanation is strongly congruent with additional details of lumbar column reduction and lower back stabilization in African apes. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 314B:723-734, 2010.

Plant Foods Consumed by Pan: Exploring the Variation of Nutritional Ecology Across Africa,"['Hohmann, G', 'Potts, K', ""N'Guessan, A"", 'Fowler, A', 'Mundry, R', 'Ganzhorn, JU', 'Ortmann, S']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21168,MAR 2010,24,"It has been shown that differences in resource density and nutrient supply affect variation in ranging patterns, habitat use, and sociality. Among nonhuman primates, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (P. paniscus) have often been used as models for the link between social system and habitat ecology. Field reports suggest that resource density is higher in habitats occupied by bonobos (compared to chimpanzee habitats), and in the West (compared to the East) of the range of chimpanzees. In this study we compared diet quality at the level of species and populations using information from nutritional analyses of fruit and leaves consumed by chimpanzees (three) and bonobos (one population). Quality of plant foods was assessed on the basis of a) the concentration of macronutrients, fiber, and anti-feedants, and b) associations of different nutrient components. Overall plant samples collected at each site differed in terms of macronutrient content. However, nutritious quality and gross energy content of food samples were similar suggesting that dietary quality reflects selectivity rather than habitat ecology. The quality of plant foods consumed by bonobos was within the range of chimpanzees and the quality of plant foods consumed by western chimpanzees was not higher than that of eastern chimpanzees. While the results showed significant variation across forests inhabited by Pan, they did not match with geographical patterns between and within Pan species as proposed in previous studies. This suggests that the nutritional quality of the habitat is not always a reliable predictor of the quality of the diet. Am J Phys Anthropol 141:476-485, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

However, there has yet to be a direct comparison of the inhibitory skills of the nonhuman apes and their development in human children. We compared the inhibitory skills of all great ape species, including 3-5-year-old children in a detour-reaching task, which required subjects to avoid reaching directly for food and instead use an indirect reaching method to successfully obtain the food. We tested 22 chimpanzees, 18 bonobos, 18 orangutans, 6 gorillas and 42 children. Our sample included chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans housed in zoos (N = 27) and others housed in sanctuaries in their native habitats (N = 37). Overall, orangutans were the most skilful apes, including human children. As expected older children outperformed younger children. Sanctuary chimpanzees and bonobos outperformed their zoo counterparts whereas there was no difference between the two orangutan samples. Most zoo chimpanzees and bonobos failed to solve the original task, but improved their performance with additional training, although the training method determined to a considerable extent the level of success that the apes achieved in a transfer phase. In general, the performance of the older children was far from perfect and comparable to some of the nonhuman apes tested."
Why do gorillas make sequences of gestures?,"['Genty, E', 'Byrne, RW']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-009-0266-4,MAR 2010,25,"Great ape gestures have attracted considerable research interest in recent years, prompted by their flexible and intentional pattern of use; but almost all studies have focused on single gestures. Here, we report the first quantitative analysis of sequential gesture use in western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), using data from three captive groups and one African study site. We found no evidence that gesture sequences were given for reasons of increased communicative efficiency over single gestures. Longer sequences of repeated gestures did not increase the likelihood of response, and using a sequence was seldom in reaction to communicative failure. Sequential combination of two gestures with similar meanings did not generally increase effectiveness, and sometimes reduced it. Gesture sequences were closely associated with play contexts. Markov transition analysis showed two networks of frequently co-occurring gestures, both consisting of gestures used to regulate play. One network comprised only tactile gestures, the other a mix of silent, audible and tactile gestures; apparently, these clusters resulted from gesture use in play with proximal or distal contact, respectively. No evidence was found for syntactic effects of sequential combination: meanings changed little or not at all. Semantically, many gestures overlapped massively with others in their core information (i.e. message), and gesture messages spanned relatively few functions. We suggest that the underlying semantics of gorilla gestures is highly simplified compared to that of human words. Gesture sequences allow continual adjustment of the tempo and nature of social interactions, rather than generally conveying semantically referential information or syntactic structures."
Variance in the male reproductive success of western gorillas: acquiring females is just the beginning,"['Breuer, T', 'Robbins, AM', 'Olejniczak, C', 'Parnell, RJ', 'Stokes, EJ', 'Robbins, MM']",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,10.1007/s00265-009-0867-6,MAR 2010,16,"Variance in male reproductive success is expected to be high in sexually dimorphic mammals, even when it is modulated by the costs and benefits of group living. Here, we investigate the variance in reproductive success of male western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), a highly dimorphic primate with long-term male-female associations, using 12.5 years of data collected at Mbeli Bai in northern Congo. Access to mates and offspring survival were both major sources of variance in male reproductive success. Males with larger harems had lower offspring mortality with no apparent reduction in female fertility or observed tenure length, so the size of harems did not seem to be limited by female feeding competition or by the risk of takeovers and infanticide by outsider males. The lower mortality in larger harems may reflect improved vigilance against predators, and females may cluster around males that enhance offspring survival. Thus, this study illustrates how a detailed analysis of the components of male reproductive success can shed light on the interrelated social and ecological aspects that affect it."
Intuitions about gravity and solidity in great apes: the tubes task,"['Cacchione, T', 'Call, J']",DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE,10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00881.x,MAR 2010,11,"We investigated whether great apes, like human infants, monkeys and dogs, are subject to a strong gravity bias when tested with the tubes task, and - in case of mastery - what the source of competence on the tubes task is. We presented 22 apes with three versions of the tubes task, in which an object is dropped down a tube connected to one of three potential hiding places and the subject is required to locate the object. In two versions, apes were confronted with a causal tube that varied in the amount of perceptual information it provided (i.e. presence or absence of acoustic cues). The third version was a non-causal adaptation of the task in which a painted line 'connected' dropping and hiding places. Results indicate that apes neither have a reliable gravity bias when tested with the tubes, nor understand the causal function of the tube. Even though there is evidence that they can integrate tube-related causal information to localize the object, they seem to depend mainly on non-causal inferences when searching for an invisibly displaced object."

This new species has a spherical body with a frontal lobe, a long vestibulum, a cytoproct located at the posterior dorsal side of the body, an ovoid macronucleus, a contractile vacuole near the cytoproct, and a large concavity on the left surface of the body. Buccal ciliature is non-retractable and consists of three ciliary zones: an adoral zone surrounding the vestibular opening, a dorso-adoral zone extending transversely at the basis of the frontal lobe, and a vestibular zone longitudinally extending in a gently spiral curve to line the surface of the vestibulum. Two non-retractable somatic ciliary zones comprise arches over the body surface: a short dorsal ciliary arch extending transversely at the basis of the frontal lobe and a wide C-shaped left ciliary arch in the left concavity. Because of the presence of three ciliary zones in the non-retractable buccal ciliature, the present genus might be a member of the family Blepharocorythidae, but the large left concavity and the C-shaped left ciliary arch are unique, such structures have never been described from other blepharocorythids."

Mobile elements reveal small population size in the ancient ancestors of Homo sapiens,"['Huff, CD', 'Xing, JC', 'Rogers, AR', 'Witherspoon, D', 'Jorde, LB']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0909000107,FEB 2 2010,18,"The genealogies of different genetic loci vary in depth. The deeper the genealogy, the greater the chance that it will include a rare event, such as the insertion of a mobile element. Therefore, the genealogy of a region that contains a mobile element is on average older than that of the rest of the genome. In a simple demographic model, the expected time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) is doubled if a rare insertion is present. We test this expectation by examining single nucleotide polymorphisms around polymorphic Alu insertions from two completely sequenced human genomes. The estimated TMRCA for regions containing a polymorphic insertion is two times larger than the genomic average (P < < 10(-30)), as predicted. Because genealogies that contain polymorphic mobile elements are old, they are shaped largely by the forces of ancient population history and are insensitive to recent demographic events, such as bottlenecks and expansions. Remarkably, the information in just two human DNA sequences provides substantial information about ancient human population size. By comparing the likelihood of various demographic models, we estimate that the effective population size of human ancestors living before 1.2 million years ago was 18,500, and we can reject all models where the ancient effective population size was larger than 26,000. This result implies an unusually small population for a species spread across the entire Old World, particularly in light of the effective population sizes of chimpanzees (21,000) and gorillas (25,000), which each inhabit only one part of a single continent."

Here, we analyze 32 microsatellite loci in 144 individuals using a Bayesian clustering method to delineate clusters of individuals among a sample of founders of the captive North American zoo gorilla collection. We infer that the majority of North American zoo founders sampled are distributed into two distinct clusters, and that some individuals are of admixed ancestry. This new information regarding the existence of ancestral genetic population structure in the North American zoo population lays the groundwork for enhanced efforts to conserve the evolutionary units of the western lowland gorilla gene pool. Our data also show that the genetic diversity estimates in the founder population were comparable to those in wild gorilla populations (Mondika and Cross River), and that pairwise relatedness among the founders is no different from that expected for a random mating population. However, the relatively high level of relatedness (R = 0.54) we discovered in a pair of known breeding pairs reveals the need for incorporating genetic relatedness estimates in the captive management of western lowland gorillas."

Specifically, the genus Homo is said to be characterized by larger femoral heads, shorter femoral necks, and more lateral flare of the greater trochanter than are members of the genera Australopithecus or Paranthropus. Here, a digitizing arm was used to collect landmark data on recent human (n=82), chimpanzee (n=16), and gorilla (n=20) femora and casts of six fossil hominin femora in order to test whether one can discriminate extant and fossil hominid (sensu faro) femora into different taxa using three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometric analyses. Twenty proximal femoral landmarks were chosen to best quantify the shape differences between hominin genera. These data were first subjected to Procrustes analysis. The resultant fitted coordinate values were then subjected to PCA. PC scores were used to compute a dissimilarity matrix that was subjected to cluster analyses. Results indicate that one can easily distinguish Homo, Pan, and Gorilla from each other based on proximal femur shape, and one can distinguish Pliocene and Early Pleistocene hominin femora from those of recent Homo. It is more difficult to distinguish Early Pleistocene Homo proximal femora from those of Australopithecus or Paranthropus, but cluster analyses appear to separate the fossil hominins into four groups: an early australopith cluster that is an outlier from other fossil hominins; and two clusters that are sister taxa to each other: a late australopith/Paranthropus group and an early Homo group.

Phylogenetic analyses showed that gorillas acquired the simian immunodeficiency virus SIVgor from chimpanzees, and viruses from the SIVcpz/SIVgor lineage have been transmitted to humans on at least four occasions, leading to HIV-1 groups M, N, O, and P. To determine the geographic distribution, prevalence, and species association of SIVgor, we conducted a comprehensive molecular epidemiological survey of wild gorillas in Central Africa. Gorilla fecal samples were collected in the range of western lowland gorillas (n = 2,367) and eastern Grauer gorillas (n = 183) and tested for SIVgor antibodies and nucleic acids. SIVgor antibody-positive samples were identified at 2 sites in Cameroon, with no evidence of infection at 19 other sites, including 3 in the range of the Eastern gorillas. In Cameroon, based on DNA and microsatellite analyses of a subset of samples, we estimated the prevalence of SIVgor to be 1.6% (range, 0% to 4.6%), which is significantly lower than the prevalence of SIVcpzPtt in chimpanzees (5.9%; range, 0% to 32%). All newly identified SIVgor strains formed a monophyletic lineage within the SIVcpz radiation, closely related to HIV-1 groups O and P, and clustered according to their field site of origin. At one site, there was evidence for intergroup transmission and a high intragroup prevalence. These isolated hot spots of SIVgor-infected gorilla communities could serve as a source for human infection. The overall low prevalence and sporadic distribution of SIVgor could suggest a decline of SIVgor in wild populations, but it cannot be excluded that SIVgor is still more prevalent in other parts of the geographical range of gorillas."

Recently, Plasmodium gaboni, another closely related chimpanzee parasite, was discovered, suggesting that the diversity of Plasmodium circulating in great apes in Africa might have been underestimated. It was also recently shown that P. reichenowi is a geographically widespread and genetically diverse chimpanzee parasite and that the world diversity of P. falciparum is fully included within the much broader genetic diversity of P. reichenowi. The evidence indicates that all extant populations of P. falciparum originated from P. reichenowi, likely by a single transfer from chimpanzees. In this work, we have studied the diversity of Plasmodium species infecting chimpanzees and gorillas in Central Africa (Cameroon and Gabon) from both wild-living and captive animals. The studies in wild apes used noninvasive sampling methods. We confirm the presence of P. reichenowi and P. gaboni in wild chimpanzees. Moreover, our results reveal the existence of an unexpected genetic diversity of Plasmodium lineages circulating in gorillas. We show that gorillas are naturally infected by two related lineages of parasites that have not been described previously, herein referred to as Plasmodium GorA and P.

Dental development and life history in living African and Asian apes,"['Kelley, J', 'Schwartz, GT']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.0906206107,JAN 19 2010,32,"Life-history inference is an important aim of paleoprimatology, but life histories cannot be discerned directly from the fossil record. Among extant primates, the timing of many life-history attributes is correlated with the age at emergence of the first permanent molar (M1), which can therefore serve as a means to directly compare the life histories of fossil and extant species. To date, M1 emergence ages exist for only a small fraction of extant primate species and consist primarily of data from captive individuals, which may show accelerated dental eruption compared with free-living individuals. Data on M1 emergence ages in wild great apes exist for only a single chimpanzee individual, with data for gorillas and orangutans being anecdotal. This paucity of information limits our ability to make life-history inferences using the M1 emergence ages of extinct ape and hominin species. Here we report reliable ages at M1 emergence for the orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus (4.6 y), and the gorilla, Gorilla gorilla (3.8 y), obtained from the dental histology of wild-shot individuals in museum collections. These ages and the one reported age at M1 emergence in a free-living chimpanzee of approximately 4.0 y are highly concordant with the comparative life histories of these great apes. They are also consistent with the average age at M1 emergence in relation to the timing of life-history events in modern humans, thus confirming the utility of M1 emergence ages for life-history inference and providing a basis for making reliable life-history inferences for extinct apes and hominins."
Joint Orientation and Function in Great Ape and Human Proximal Pedal Phalanges,"['Griffin, NL', 'Richmond, BG', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21121,JAN 2010,13,"Previous studies have referred to the degree of dorsal canting of the base of the proximal phalanx as an indicator of human-like metatarsophalangeal joint function and thus a diagnostic trait of habitual bipedality in the fossil record. Here, we used a simple method to investigate differences in forefoot function on a finer scale. Building on Duncan et al.'s (Am J Phys Anthropol 93 [1994] 67-81) research, we tested whether dorsal canting reflects differences between sexes in locomotor behavior, whether habitual shoe wear influences dorsal canting in humans, and whether proximal joint morphology differs between rays in Pan and humans. Our results corroborate previous research in showing that humans have proximal phalanges with joint orientations that are significantly more dorsal than, but overlap with, those of great apes. We also found that male gorillas have significantly more dorsally canted second proximal phalanges than their female counterparts, while the opposite pattern between the sexes was found in Pan troglodytes. Inter-ray comparisons indicate that Pan have more dorsally canted first proximal phalanges than second proximal phalanges, while the opposite pattern was found in humans. Minimally shod humans have slightly but significantly more dorsally canted second proximal phalanges than those of habitually shod humans, indicating that phalanges of unshod humans provide the most appropriate comparative samples for analyses of early hominins. Overall, our analysis suggests that though the measurement of dorsal canting is limited in its sensitivity to certain intraspecific differences in function, phalangeal joint orientation reflects interspecific differences in joint function, with the caveat that different patterns of forefoot function during gait can involve similar articular sets of metatarsophalangeal joints.

Animal tool use: current definitions and an updated comprehensive catalog,"['Bentley-Condit, VK', 'Smith, EO']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/000579509X12512865686555,2010,42,"Despite numerous attempts to define animal tool use over the past four decades, the definition remains elusive and the behaviour classification somewhat subjective. Here, we provide a brief review of the definitions of animal tool use and show how those definitions have been modified over time. While some aspects have remained constant (i.e., the distinction between 'true' and 'borderline' tool use), others have been added (i.e., the distinction between 'dynamic' and 'static' behaviours). We present an updated, comprehensive catalog of documented animal tool use that indicates whether the behaviours observed included any 'true' tool use, whether the observations were limited to captive animals, whether tool manufacture has been observed, and whether the observed tool use was limited to only one individual and, thus, 'anecdotal' (i.e., N = 1). Such a catalog has not been attempted since Beck (1980). In addition to being a useful reference for behaviourists, this catalog demonstrates broad tool use and manufacture trends that may be of interest to phylogenists, evolutionary ecologists, and cognitive evolutionists. Tool use and tool manufacture are shown to be widespread across three phyla and seven classes of the animal kingdom. Moreover, there is complete overlap between the Aves and Mammalia orders in terms of the tool use categories (e. g., food extraction, food capture, agonism) arguing against any special abilities of mammals. The majority of tool users, almost 85% of the entries, use tools in only one of the tool use categories. Only members of the Passeriformes and Primates orders have been observed to use tools in four or more of the ten categories. Thus, observed tool use by some members of these two orders (e. g., Corvus, Papio) is qualitatively different from that of all other animal taxa. Finally, although there are similarities between Aves and Mammalia, and Primates and Passeriformes, primate tool use is qualitatively different. Approximately 35% of the entries for this order demonstrate a breadth of tool use (i.e., three or more categories by any one species) compared to other mammals (0%), Aves (2.4%), and the Passeriformes (3.1%). This greater breadth in tool use by some organisms may involve phylogenetic or cognitive differences - or may simply reflect differences in length and intensity of observations. The impact that tool usage may have had on groups' respective ecological niches and, through niche-construction, on their respective evolutionary trajectories remains a subject for future study."
Paleolithic public goods games: why human culture and cooperation did not evolve in one step,"['Dubreuil, B']",BIOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY,10.1007/s10539-009-9177-7,JAN 2010,13,"It is widely agreed that humans have specific abilities for cooperation and culture that evolved since their split with their last common ancestor with chimpanzees. Many uncertainties remain, however, about the exact moment in the human lineage when these abilities evolved. This article argues that cooperation and culture did not evolve in one step in the human lineage and that the capacity to stick to long-term and risky cooperative arrangements evolved before properly modern culture. I present evidence that Homo heidelbergensis became increasingly able to secure contributions form others in two demanding Paleolithic public good games (PPGGs): cooperative feeding and cooperative breeding. I argue that the temptation to defect is high in these PPGGs and that the evolution of human cooperation in Homo heidelberngensis is best explained by the emergence of modern-like abilities for inhibitory control and goal maintenance. These executive functions are localized in the prefrontal cortex and allow humans to stick to social norms in the face of competing motivations. This scenario is consistent with data on brain evolution that indicate that the largest growth of the prefrontal cortex in human evolution occurred in Homo heidelbergensis and was followed by relative stasis in this part of the brain. One implication of this argument is that subsequent behavioral innovations, including the evolution of symbolism, art, and properly cumulative culture in modern Homo sapiens, are unlikely to be related to a reorganization of the prefrontal cortex, despite frequent claims to the contrary in the literature on the evolution of human culture and cognition."
Identification of differences in human and great ape phytanic acid metabolism that could influence gene expression profiles and physiological functions.,"['Watkins, Paul A', 'Moser, Ann B', 'Toomer, Cicely B', 'Steinberg, Steven J', 'Moser, Hugo W', 'Karaman, Mazen W', 'Ramaswamy, Krishna', 'Siegmund, Kimberly D', 'Lee, D Rick', 'Ely, John J', 'Ryder, Oliver A', 'Hacia, Joseph G']",BMC physiology,10.1186/1472-6793-10-19,2010 Oct 08,9,"BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that anatomical differences in human and great ape guts arose in response to species-specific diets and energy demands. To investigate functional genomic consequences of these differences, we compared their physiological levels of phytanic acid, a branched chain fatty acid that can be derived from the microbial degradation of chlorophyll in ruminant guts. Humans who accumulate large stores of phytanic acid commonly develop cerebellar ataxia, peripheral polyneuropathy, and retinitis pigmentosa in addition to other medical conditions. Furthermore, phytanic acid is an activator of the PPAR-alpha transcription factor that influences the expression of genes relevant to lipid metabolism.

RESULTS: Despite their trace dietary phytanic acid intake, all great ape species had elevated red blood cell (RBC) phytanic acid levels relative to humans on diverse diets. Unlike humans, chimpanzees showed sexual dimorphism in RBC phytanic acid levels, which were higher in males relative to females. Cultured skin fibroblasts from all species had a robust capacity to degrade phytanic acid. We provide indirect evidence that great apes, in contrast to humans, derive significant amounts of phytanic acid from the hindgut fermentation of plant materials. This would represent a novel reduction of metabolic activity in humans relative to the great apes.

CONCLUSION: We identified differences in the physiological levels of phytanic acid in humans and great apes and propose this is causally related to their gut anatomies and microbiomes. Phytanic acid levels could contribute to cross-species and sex-specific differences in human and great ape transcriptomes, especially those related to lipid metabolism. Based on the medical conditions caused by phytanic acid accumulation, we suggest that differences in phytanic acid metabolism could influence the functions of human and great ape nervous, cardiovascular, and skeletal systems."
Performance of distance-based DNA barcoding in the molecular identification of Primates,"['Nijman, V', 'Aliabadian, M']",COMPTES RENDUS BIOLOGIES,10.1016/j.crvi.2009.10.003,JAN 2010,12,"For comparative primatology proper recognition of basal taxa (i.e. species) is indispensable, and in this the choice of a suitable gene with high phylogenetic resolution is crucial. For the goals of species identification in animals, the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) has been introduced as standard marker. Making use of the difference in intra- and interspecific genetic variation - the DNA barcoding gap - cox1 can be used as a fast and accurate marker for the identification of animal species. For the Order Primates we compare the performance of cox1 (166 sequences; 50 nominal species) in species-identification with that of two other mitochondrial markers, 16S ribosomal RNA (412 sequences, 92 species) and cytochrome b (cob: 547 sequences, 72 species). A wide gap exist between intra- and interspecific divergences for both cox1 and cob genes whereas this gap is less apparent for 165, indicating that rRNA genes are less suitable for species delimitation in DNA barcoding. For those species where multiple sequences are available there are significant differences in the intraspecific genetic distances between different mitochondrial markers, without, however, showing a consistent pattern. We conclude that cox1 allows accurate differentiation of species and as such DNA barcoding may have an important role to play in comparative primatology. (C) 2009 Academie des sciences.

MORPHOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR EVIDENCE REVEALS RECENT HYBRIDIZATION BETWEEN GORILLA TAXA,"['Ackermann, RR', 'Bishop, JM']",EVOLUTION,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00858.x,JAN 2010,19,"Molecular studies have demonstrated a deep lineage split between the two gorilla species, as well as divisions within these taxa; estimates place this divergence in the mid-Pleistocene, with gene flow continuing until approximately 80,000 years ago. Here, we present analyses of skeletal data indicating the presence of substantial recent gene flow among gorillas at all taxonomic levels: between populations, subspecies, and species. Complementary analyses of DNA sequence variation suggest that low-level migration occurred primarily in awesterly-to-easterly direction. In western gorillas, the locations of hybrid phenotypes map closely to expectations based on population refugia and riverine barrier hypotheses, supporting the presence of significant vicariance-driven structuring and occasional admixture within this taxon. In eastern lowland gorillas, the high frequency of hybrid phenotypes is surprising, suggesting that this region represents a zone of introgression between eastern gorillas and migrants from the west, and underscoring the conservation priority of this critically endangered group. These results highlight the complex nature of evolutionary divergence in this genus, indicate that historical gene flow has played a major role in structuring gorilla diversity, and demonstrate that our understanding of the evolutionary processes responsible for shaping biodiversity can benefit immensely from consideration of morphological and molecular data in conjunction."
Cryptosporidium in wild placental mammals,"['Feng, YY']",EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/j.exppara.2008.11.005,JAN 2010,27,"Cryptosporidium species are common parasites of wild placental mammals. Recent parasitological studies combined with molecular genotyping techniques have been providing valuable new insight into the host specificity and potential transmission of various Cryptosporidium species/genotypes among animals and between these animals and humans. Although Cryptosporidium in wild animals may possess a potential public health problem due to oocyst contamination in the environment, studies at various regions of the world have indicated a strong host-adaptation by these parasites and a limited potential of cross-species transmission of cryptosporidiosis among placental mammals, suggesting that these animals are probably not a major reservoir for human infection. However, Cryptosporidium species/genotypes in placental animals have been reported occasionally in humans. Therefore, public health significance of some Cryptosporidium species in wild placental mammals, such as the cervine genotype, should not be overlooked and should be further studied.

Influence of the Task on Hand Preference: Individual Differences among Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Pouydebat, E', 'Reghem, E', 'Gorce, P', 'Bels, V']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000322552,2010,8,"The degree of task complexity and bimanual complementarity have been proposed as factors affecting lateralization strength in humans. However, a large number of studies have demonstrated group-level lateral hand bias for different manual activities in numerous non-human primate species. However, no study has tested the effects that a variety of tasks may have in inducing differences in hand preference. Here, we aim to test if 3 adult gorillas exhibited a greater hand preference bias performing 4 tasks of varying complexity: grasping small versus large foods, proto-tool use task and tool use task involving greater visuospatial requirements. We found that (1) the complexity of the task does not necessarily induce a right-handed bias and (2) a subject can be right-handed for a complex task and left-handed for another one. These results, complemented by many publications on hand preference in non-human primates, reveal a great variability in hand preference, which makes it very difficult to deduce any details of hominin handedness with artefacts.

A Likelihood Ratio Test of Speciation with Gene Flow Using Genomic Sequence Data,"['Yang, ZH']",GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/gbe/evq011,2010,25,"Genomic sequence data may be used to test hypotheses about the process of species formation. In this paper, I implement a likelihood ratio test of variable species divergence times over the genome, which may be considered a test of the null model of allopatric speciation without gene flow against the alternative model of parapatric speciation with gene flow. Two models are implemented in the likelihood framework, which accommodate coalescent events in the ancestral populations in a phylogeny of three species. One model assumes a constant species divergence time over the genome, whereas another allows it to vary. Computer simulation shows that the test has acceptable false positive rate but to achieve reasonable power, hundreds or even thousands of genomic loci may be necessary. The test is applied to genomic data from the human, chimpanzee, and gorilla."

The ontogeny of triadic cooperative interactions with humans in an infant gorilla,"['Gomez, JC']",INTERACTION STUDIES,10.1075/is.11.3.02gom,2010,8,"This paper reports a longitudinal study on the ontogeny of triadic cooperative interactions (involving coordinations of objects and people) in a hand-reared lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from 6 months to 36 months of age. Using the behavioural categories developed by Hubley and Trevarthen (1979) to characterize the origins of ""secondary intersubjectivity"" in human babies between 8-12 months of age, I chart the emergence of comparable coordinations of gestures and actions with objects and acts of dyadic communication. The findings show that the categories and concepts of secondary intersubjectivity are applicable to the gorilla, who engages with people in cooperative actions with objects. The ontogeny of triadic interaction in the gorilla was very similar to that described in human infants, but more extended in time and with some peculiarities, such as the absence of pointing and showing gestures, some of whose functions might be taken over by contact gestures which in human infants may appear later in development. The results do not support claims of human uniqueness in the development of cooperative action, but suggest a heterochrony in some aspects of the ontogeny of triadic interactions leading to a divergence between gorilla and human infants within secondary intersubjectivity."

Preliminary surveys for apes on the Reserve periphery in the 1990s indicated that this area may also contain high densities of apes and we wished to verify this. Using distance sampling methodology we surveyed 1,029 km(2) of the south-eastern Reserve periphery including Raphia swamp forests. We recorded 1,021 ape nests along 21 2-km transects. Results indicated that ape density estimated from nest group density, excluding old and very old Raphia nests (which may decay slowly), was very high: 6.81 weaned apes km(-2) (95% confidence interval 3.93-11.84). Gorillas built most of the nests recorded: their density was estimated at 5.25 individuals km(-2) (2.70-10.19). Most nests were constructed in Raphia swamp forest despite it covering only 25% of the study area. These are among the highest recorded densities of apes in Central Africa but, as nest decay rates in swamps are unstudied, we also estimated densities based on hypothetically slow nest decay rates and published data from other habitats. Gorilla densities may be linked to availability of monocotyledons as food and the natural protection from hunting offered by Raphia swamps. Gorilla density in swamp forest is spatially and temporally variable and surveys are required to estimate ape populations elsewhere in this habitat. Most Raphia swamps in Congo are unprotected, including the periphery of Lac Tele Community Reserve; protection and management are required to assure their continued availability for apes."

We aimed to identify factors influencing infection risk for specific intestinal parasites in wild orangutans and individuals living in captivity. Various genera of Protozoa (including Entamoeba, Endolimax, Iodamoeba, Balantidium, Giardia and Blastocystis), nematodes (Such as Strongyloides, Trichuris, Ascaris, Enterobius, Trichostrongylus and hookworms) and one trematode (a dicrocoeliid) were identified. For the first time, the cestode Hymenolepis was detected in orangutans. Highest prevalences were found for Strongyloides (individuals 37%; groups 58%), hookworms (41%; 58%), Balantidium (40%; 61%), Entamoeba coli (29%; 53%) and a trichostrongylid (13%; 32%). In re-introduction centres, infants were at higher risk of infection with Strongyloides than adults. Infection risk for hookworms was significantly higher in wild males compared with females. In groups, the centres themselves had a significant influence on the infection risk for Balantidium. Ranging patterns of wild orangutans, overcrowding in captivity and a shift of age composition in favour of immatures seemed to be the most likely factors leading to these results."
Vertebrate DNA in Fecal Samples from Bonobos and Gorillas: Evidence for Meat Consumption or Artefact?,"['Hofreiter, M', 'Kreuz, E', 'Eriksson, J', 'Schubert, G', 'Hohmann, G']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0009419,FEB 25 2010,7,"Background: Deciphering the behavioral repertoire of great apes is a challenge for several reasons. First, due to their elusive behavior in dense forest environments, great ape populations are often difficult to observe. Second, members of the genus Pan are known to display a great variety in their behavioral repertoire; thus, observations from one population are not necessarily representative for other populations. For example, bonobos (Pan paniscus) are generally believed to consume almost no vertebrate prey. However, recent observations show that at least some bonobo populations may consume vertebrate prey more commonly than previously believed. We investigated the extent of their meat consumption using PCR amplification of vertebrate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) segments from DNA extracted from bonobo feces. As a control we also attempted PCR amplifications from gorilla feces, a species assumed to be strictly herbivorous.

Principal Findings: We found evidence for consumption of a variety of mammalian species in about 16% of the samples investigated. Moreover, 40% of the positive DNA amplifications originated from arboreal monkeys. However, we also found duiker and monkey mtDNA in the gorilla feces, albeit in somewhat lower percentages. Notably, the DNA sequences isolated from the two ape species fit best to the species living in the respective regions. This result suggests that the sequences are of regional origin and do not represent laboratory contaminants.

Conclusions: Our results allow at least three possible and mutually not exclusive conclusions. First, all results may represent contamination of the feces by vertebrate DNA from the local environment. Thus, studies investigating a species' diet from feces DNA may be unreliable due to the low copy number of DNA originating from diet items. Second, there is some inherent difference between the bonobo and gorilla feces, with only the later ones being contaminated. Third, similar to bonobos, for which the consumption of monkeys has only recently been documented, the gorilla population investigated (for which very little observational data are as yet available) may occasionally consume small vertebrates. Although the last explanation is speculative, it should not be discarded a-priori given that observational studies continue to unravel new behaviors in great ape species."
Behavioral Response of Captive Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) to the Death of Silverbacks in Multi-Male Groups,"['Less, EH', 'Lukas, KE', 'Kuhar, CW', 'Stoinski, TS']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20246,JAN-FEB 2010,2,"In both free-ranging and captive western lowland gorillas, a silverback provides protection and leadership, mediating conflict within a group. In the wild, when a dominant silverback dies the group will disperse or transfer to a solitary male., unless a subsequent male is present to inherit the group. In captivity, Studies have focused on groups containing one male and therefore it is unclear how gorillas respond to the death or removal of a silverback in multi-male groups. This study examined the behavior of a bachelor group (Cleveland Metroparks Zoo) and a multi-male, mixed-sex group (Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium) following the death of two older silverbacks in 2005. Both of the younger but dominant males maintained their same level of dominance after the death. We predicted that agonism would increase after the death as groups struggled for social stablility. We did observe an increase in both agonism and displacements among the bachelor group, but only observed an increase in displacements among the mixed-sex group. Although we predicted that there would be no change in solitary behavior, both groups decreased feeding and the mixed-sex group increased self-directed behavior post-death. In the bachelor group, self-directed behavior decreased and undesirable behavior increased. We also observed a difference in spatial distance after the death with members of the mixed-sex group becoming more dispersed and members of the bachelor group more converged. This study demonstrates that there is a period of transition for multi-male groups after the death or removal of the oldest silverback. Future research could integrate physiological measures with behavioral analyses before and after the death or removal of a prominent member of the group. Zoo Biol 29:16-29, 20 10.

To better understand the selective pressures that favored the distinctive dental and locomotor morphologies of gibbons and orangutans, we examined the foraging and ranging behavior of sympatric Hylobates albibarbis and Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii during an episode of low fruit availability at Tuanan, Kalimantan Tengah, Indonesia. We found that Hylobates ranged 0.5 km day(-1) or 33% farther than did Pongo, but the overall daily ranging of both species did not vary as fruit availability decreased by as much as 50%. Among gibbons, we observed dietary switching to fallback foods; in particular, there was a progressively greater reliance on figs, liana products, and unripe fruit. Orangutans relied heavily on unripe fruit and fracture-resistant bark and pith tissues. Despite these divergent fallback patterns, the stiffness of fruit mesocarp consumed by Hylobates and Pongo did not differ. We discuss canine and molar functional morphology with respect to dietary mechanics. Next, to contextualize these results, we discuss our findings with respect to forest structure. The rain forests of Southeast Asia have been described as having open, discontinuous canopies. Such a structure may inform our understanding of the ranging behavior and distinctive locomotion of apes in the region, namely richochetal brachiation and quadrumanous clambering.

Here we report results on adult male and female western gorilla foraging behavior, based on systematic focal observations and nutritional analyses of foods. We found that western gorillas, like other apes, are highly selective ripe fruit specialists, seeking fruit high in energy, low in antifeedants, and rare in the environment. During seasonal fruiting peaks, fruit accounted for up to 70% of feeding time. When ripe fruit was scarce, gorillas increased time spent feeding on leaves and nonpreferred fruits and herbs. Leaves were the major fallback food, accounting for up to 70% of feeding time in males and 50% in females during periods of fruit scarcity. In spite of large differences in body size, the sexes were remarkably similar in their overall diet, not differing in time spent feeding on fruit or preferred herbs. However, the male consistently fed more often and on a greater variety of leaves than did females, whereas females fed more often on fallback herbs and termites. Our findings, when considered in light of previous findings on sympatric mangabeys, indicate that the foraging strategy of western gorillas is broadly similar to that of chimpanzees and orangutans, and distinct from that of old world monkeys.

Fallback Foods and Dietary Partitioning Among Pan and Gorilla,"['Yamagiwa, J', 'Basabose, AK']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21102,DEC 2009,27,"Recent findings on the strong preference of gorillas for fruits and the large dietary overlap between sympatric gorillas and chimpanzees has led to a debate over the folivorous/frugivorous dichotomy and resource partitioning. To add insight to these arguments, we analyze the diets of sympatric gorillas and chimpanzees inhabiting the montane forest of Kahuzi-Biega National Park (DRC) using a new definition of fallback foods (Marshall and Wrangham: Int J Primatol 28 [2007] 1219-1235). We determined the preferred fruits of Kahuzi chimpanzees and gorillas from direct feeding observations and fecal analyses conducted over an 8-year period. Although there was extensive overlap in the preferred fruits of these two species, gorillas tended to consume fewer fruits with prolonged availability while chimpanzees consumed fruits with large seasonal fluctuations. Fig fruit was defined as a preferred food of chimpanzees, although it may also play a role as the staple fallback food. Animal foods, such as honey bees and ants, appear to constitute filler fallback foods of chimpanzees. Tool use allows chimpanzees to obtain such high-quality fallback foods during periods of fruit scarcity Among filler fallback foods, terrestrial herbs may enable chimpanzees to live in small home ranges in the montane forest, whereas the availability of animal foods may permit them to expand their home range in and areas. Staple fallback foods including barks enable gorillas to form cohesive groups with similar home range across habitats irrespective of fruit abundance. These differences in fallback strategies seem to have shaped different social features between sympatric gorillas and chimpanzees. Am J Phys Anthropol 140:739-750, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
The Strategic Use of Sex in Wild Female Western Gorillas,"['Doran-Sheeny, DM', 'Fernandez, D', 'Borries, C']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20743,DEC 2009,8,"Human females, unlike most mammals, are sexually active outside of fertile periods. This decoupling of sexual behavior from its conceptive function has had an enormous impact on human social relationships, and yet we know little about why there was selection for nonconceptive mating. Here we examine one form of nonconceptive mating, the mating that occurs during pregnancy or post-conceptive (PC) mating, in wild western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla). Using a near complete mating record for five females during gestation, we show that pregnant females varied in the timing and frequency of mating, and used PC mating conditionally, synchronizing copulations to occur on days when other females mated, and refraining from mating for lengthy periods when no other females mated. As pregnant females mated exclusively with the same male before and after conception, and mated in response to group female (and not male) behavior, we conclude that western gorillas used PC mating as a form of female competition, and not to confuse paternity or to obtain immediate benefits from the male, as suggested earlier. The male initiated copulations preferentially with females of high rank, rather than distinguishing between pregnant and cycling females. Therefore, PC mating appears to be a strategy by which high-ranking pregnant females attempt to minimize male interest in other females, while reinforcing their own status and potentially delaying conception in others. These findings indicate that female-mating competition is more important than considered earlier, and may be a factor in the evolution of nonconceptive mating in humans. Am. J.

Mass spectral analyses of the two major apolipoproteins of great ape high density lipoproteins,"['Puppione, DL', 'Della Donna, L', 'Laganowsky, AD', 'Bassilian, S', 'Souda, P', 'Ryder, OA', 'Whitelegge, JP']",COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS,10.1016/j.cbd.2009.09.001,DEC 2009,4,"The two major apolipoproteins associated with human and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) high density lipoproteins (HDL) are apoA-I and dimeric apoA-II. Although humans are closely related to great apes, apolipoprotein data do not exist for bonobos (Pan paniscus), western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and the Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii). In the absence of any data, other great apes simply have been assumed to have dimeric apoA-II while other primates and most other mammals have been shown to have monomeric apoA-II. Using mass spectrometry, we have measured the molecular masses of apoA-I and apoA-II associated with the HDL of these great apes. Each was observed to have dimeric apoA-II. Being phylogenetically related, one would anticipate these apolipoproteins having a high percentage of invariant sequences when compared with human apolipoproteins. However, the orangutan, which diverged from the human lineage between 16 and 21 million years ago, had an apoA-II with the lowest monomeric mass, 8031.3 Da and the highest apoA-I value, 28,311.7 Da, currently reported for various mammals. Interestingly, the gorilla that diverged from the lineage leading to the human-chimpanzee branch after the orangutan had almost identical mass values to those reported for human apoA-I and apoA-II. But chimpanzee and the bonobo that diverged more recently had identical apoA-II mass values that were slightly larger than reported for the human apolipoprotein. The chimpanzee A-I mass values were very close to those of humans; however, the bonobo had values intermediate to the molecular masses of orangutan and the other great apes. With the already existing genomic data for chimpanzee and the recent entries for the orangutan and gorilla, we were able to demonstrate a close agreement between our mass spectral data and the calculated molecular weights determined from the predicted primary sequences of the respective apolipoproteins. Post-translational modification of these apolipoproteins, involving truncation and oxidation of methionine, are also reported. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Transvalued Species in an African Forest,"['Remis, MJ', 'Hardin, R']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01290.x,DEC 2009,12,"We combined ethnographic investigations with repeated ecological transect surveys in the Dzanga-Sangha Dense Forest Reserve (RDS), Central African Republic, to elucidate consequences of intensifying mixed use of forests. We devised a framework for transvaluation of wildlife species, which means the valuing of species on the basis of their ecological, economic, and symbolic roles in human lives. We measured responses to hunting, tourism, and conservation of two transvalued species in RDS: elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla). Our methods included collecting data on encounter rates and habitat use on line transects. We recorded cross-cultural variation in ideas about and interactions with these species during participant observation of hunting and tourism encounters and ethnographic interviews with hunters, conservation staff, researchers, and tourists. Ecologically, gorillas used human-modified landscapes successfully, and elephants were more vulnerable than gorillas to hunting. Economically, tourism and encounters with elephants and gorillas generated revenues and other benefits for local participants. Symbolically, transvaluation of species seemed to undergird competing institutions of forest management that could prove unsustainable. Nevertheless, transvaluation may also offer alternatives to existing social hierarchies, thereby integrating local and transnational support for conservation measures. The study of transvaluation requires attention to transnational flows of ideas and resources because they influence transspecies interactions. Cross-disciplinary in nature, transvalution of species addresses the political and economic challenges to conservation because it recognizes the varied human communities that shape the survival of wildlife in a given site. Transvaluation of species could foster more socially inclusive management and monitoring approaches attuned to competing economic demands, specific species behaviors, and human practices at local scales."
A Legacy of Low-Impact Logging does not Elevate Prevalence of Potentially Pathogenic Protozoa in Free-Ranging Gorillas and Chimpanzees in the Republic of Congo: Logging and Parasitism in African Apes,"['Gillespie, TR', 'Morgan, D', 'Deutsch, JC', 'Kuhlenschmidt, MS', 'Salzer, JS', 'Cameron, K', 'Reed, T', 'Sanz, C']",ECOHEALTH,10.1007/s10393-010-0283-4,DEC 2009,11,"Many studies have examined the long-term effects of selective logging on the abundance and diversity of free-ranging primates. Logging is known to reduce the abundance of some primate species through associated hunting and the loss of food trees for frugivores; however, the potential role of pathogens in such primate population declines is largely unexplored. Selective logging results in a suite of alterations in host ecology and forest structure that may alter pathogen dynamics in resident wildlife populations. In addition, environmental pollution with human fecal material may present a risk for wildlife infections with zoonotic protozoa, such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia. To better understand this interplay, we compared patterns of infection with these potentially pathogenic protozoa in sympatric western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in the undisturbed Goualougo Triangle of Nouabal,-Ndoki National Park and the adjacent previously logged Kabo Concession in northern Republic of Congo. No Cryptosporidium infections were detected in any of the apes examined and prevalence of infection with Giardia was low (3.73% overall) and did not differ between logged and undisturbed forest for chimpanzees or gorillas. These results provide a baseline for prevalence of these protozoa in forest-dwelling African apes and suggest that low-intensity logging may not result in long-term elevated prevalence of potentially pathogenic protozoa."
Testing hypotheses of dietary reconstruction from buccal dental microwear in Australopithecus afarensis,"['Estebaranz, F', 'Martinez, LM', 'Galbany, J', 'Turbon, D', 'Perez-Perez, A']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2009.07.007,DEC 2009,7,"A recent study of occlusal microwear in Australopithecus afarensis described this species as an opportunistic dweller, living in both forested and open environments and greatly relying on fallback resources and using fewer food-processing activities than previously suggested. In the present study, analysis of buccal microwear variability in a sample of A. afarensis specimens (n = 75 teeth) showed no significant correlations with the ecological shift that took place around 3.5 Ma in Africa. These results are consistent with the occlusal microwear data available. In fact, significant correlations between buccal and occlusal microwear variables were found. However, comparison of the buccal microwear patterns showed clear similarities between A. afarensis and those hominoid species living in somewhat open environments, especially the Cameroon gorillas. A diet based mainly on succulent fruits and seasonal fallback resources would be consistent with the buccal microwear patterns observed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Cryptosporidium infection in non-human hosts in Malawi,"['Banda, Z', 'Nichols, RAB', 'Grimason, AM', 'Smith, HV']",ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH,NA,DEC 2009,3,"BANDA, Z., NICHOLS, ROSELY A.B., GRIMASON, A.M. & SMITH, H.V. 2009. Cryptosporidium infection in non-human hosts in Malawi. Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research, 76:363-375

Of 1 346 faecal samples from the Chikwawa and Thyolo districts of Malawi, analysed for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts between October 2001 and May 2003, 61.3 % were from cattle (29.8 % of these were from calves <6 months old). Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected during all three seasons studied in Chikwawa and Thyolo. In Chikwawa, 13.6% of adult cattle and 11.7 % of calves were infected, compared to 28.9 % of adult cattle and 36.7 % of calves in Thyolo. Dependent on season, between 7.8% and 37.7 % (Chikwawa) and 16.7 % and 39.3 % (Thyolo) of cattle samples contained oocysts. In Chikwawa, the highest percentage of infections occurred in the cool season, whereas in Thyolo, the highest percentage of infections occurred in the dry season. Faecal samples from goats [n = 225], pigs [n = 921, sheep [n = 6]), rabbits, guinea pigs, chickens, ducks, turkeys, doves and guinea fowls were also analysed. Up to 5.6 % of goat samples contained oocysts in Chikwawa, compared to between 16.7% and 39.3% in Thyolo. Again, in Chikwawa, the highest percentage of infections occurred in the cool season and the lowest in the rainy season, whereas, in Thyolo, the highest percentage of infections occurred in the dry season and the lowest in the cool season. In pigs, more infections were detected in the dry season in Chikwawa, but infections in the cool season were similar (17.7 %), whereas in Thyolo, infections occurred in all three seasons (17.9 % in the rainy season, 25 % in the cool season and 60 % in the dry season). Of ten diarrhoeic, oocyst positive cattle faecal samples collected from Chikwawa and subjected to PCR-RFLP, four oocyst positive samples (two from heifers, one from a cow and one unknown) were amplified at an 18S rRNA and Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) loci. RFLP of the 18S rRNA locus indicated that Cryptosporidium parvum, Cryptosporidium hominis, Cryptosporidium bovis and / or Cryptosporidium ryanae DNA, or a mixture of them was present. Cryptosporidium parvum DNA was identified in one sample that amplified at the COWP locus, indicating the presence of the major zoonotic Cryptosporidium species in Malawi."
Comparing dogs and great apes in their ability to visually track object transpositions,"['Rooijakkers, EF', 'Kaminski, J', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-009-0238-8,NOV 2009,21,"Knowing that objects continue to exist after disappearing from sight and tracking invisible object displacements are two basic elements of spatial cognition. The current study compares dogs and apes in an invisible transposition task. Food was hidden under one of two cups in full view of the subject. After that both cups were displaced, systematically varying two main factors, whether cups were crossed during displacement and whether the cups were substituted by the other cup or instead cups were moved to new locations. While the apes were successful in all conditions, the dogs had a strong preference to approach the location where they last saw the reward, especially if this location remained filled. In addition, dogs seem to have especial difficulties to track the reward when both containers crossed their path during displacement. These results confirm the substantial difference that exists between great apes and dogs with regard to mental representation abilities required to track the invisible displacements of objects."
Play and social dynamics in a captive herd of gelada baboons (Theropithecus gelada),"['Mancini, G', 'Palagi, E']",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,10.1016/j.beproc.2009.07.007,NOV 2009,15,"Here, we provide quantitative data concerning adult and immature play distribution in geladas discussing the results in the light of their social dynamics. Sex differences in immature play does not seem to reflect sex differences in adult role; in fact, frequency, modality (C-play and LR-play), and motivation (measured by play initiations) to play did not vary according to the different sex-class combinations. The occurrence of adult-adult play suggests that geladas are characterized by an apparent more than actual rigidity in their social relationships and this is particularly evident in females which show peculiar traits in the use of social play. Specifically, adult females played with other adult females as much as with immature ones, thus suggesting their high motivation to engage in such interactions. This adult play behavioural pattern is typical of species showing relaxed/fluid more than despotic/rigid social relationships. Such assumption is also supported by the positive correlation observed between play and affinitive behaviours (grooming and agonistic support) found within each age-category (adult females and immature subjects). This evidence, together with the lack of correlation between aggressive contacts and social play,suggests that geladas use play for social assessment purposes and/or to increase their social affiliation levels.

Tested in pairs, Subjects had to exchange tokens with a partner to obtain food from the experimenter. We observed 4, 5, 264, and 328 transfers of tokens in gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and bonobos, respectively. Most gifts were indirect in gorillas. chimpanzees, and bonobos, whereas most were direct in orangutans. The analysis showed no evidence of calculated reciprocity in interactions. A main finding of the study was the high rate of repeated gifts and begging gestures recorded in orangutans. This raises the question of the meaning of pointing in great apes and their ability to understand the communicative intent of others."
Significant correlation of species longevity with DNA double strand break recognition but not with telomere length,"['Lorenzini, A', 'Johnson, FB', 'Oliver, A', 'Tresini, M', 'Smith, JS', 'Hdeib, M', 'Sell, C', 'Cristofalo, VJ', 'Stamato, TD']",MECHANISMS OF AGEING AND DEVELOPMENT,10.1016/j.mad.2009.10.004,NOV-DEC 2009,18,"The identification of the cellular mechanisms responsible for the wide differences in species lifespan remains one of the major unsolved problems of the biology of aging. We measured the capacity of nuclear protein to recognize DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and telomere length of skin fibroblasts derived from mammalian species that exhibit wide differences in longevity. Our results indicate DNA DSB recognition increases exponentially with longevity. Further, an analysis of the level of Ku80 protein in human, cow, and mouse suggests that Ku levels vary dramatically between species and these levels are strongly correlated with longevity. In contrast mean telomere length appears to decrease with increasing longevity of the species, although not significantly. These findings suggest that an enhanced ability to bind to DNA ends may be important for longevity. A number of possible roles for increased levels of Ku and DNA-PKcs are discussed.

The Great Divides: Ardipithecus ramidus Reveals the Postcrania of Our Last Common Ancestors with African Apes,"['Lovejoy, CO', 'Suwa, G', 'Simpson, SW', 'Matternes, JH', 'White, TD', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",SCIENCE,10.1126/science.1175833,OCT 2 2009,70,"Genomic comparisons have established the chimpanzee and bonobo as our closest living relatives. However, the intricacies of gene regulation and expression caution against the use of these extant apes in deducing the anatomical structure of the last common ancestor that we shared with them. Evidence for this structure must therefore be sought from the fossil record. Until now, that record has provided few relevant data because available fossils were too recent or too incomplete. Evidence from Ardipithecus ramidus now suggests that the last common ancestor lacked the hand, foot, pelvic, vertebral, and limb structures and proportions specialized for suspension, vertical climbing, and knuckle-walking among extant African apes. If this hypothesis is correct, each extant African ape genus must have independently acquired these specializations from more generalized ancestors who still practiced careful arboreal climbing and bridging. African apes and hominids acquired advanced orthogrady in parallel. Hominoid spinal invagination is an embryogenetic mechanism that reoriented the shoulder girdle more laterally. It was unaccompanied by substantial lumbar spine abbreviation, an adaptation restricted to vertical climbing and/ or suspension. The specialized locomotor anatomies and behaviors of chimpanzees and gorillas therefore constitute poor models for the origin and evolution of human bipedality."
Beyond Gorilla and Pongo: Alternative Models for Evaluating Variation and Sexual Dimorphism in Fossil Hominoid Samples,"['Scott, JE', 'Schrein, CM', 'Kelley, J', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21059,OCT 2009,4,"Sexual size dimorphism in the postcanine dentition of the late Miocene hominoid Lufengpithecus lufengensis exceeds that in Pongo pygmaeus, demonstrating that the maximum degree of molar size dimorphism in apes is not represented among the extant Hominoidea. It has not been established, however, that the molars of Pongo are more dimorphic than those of any other living primate. In this study, we used resampling-based methods to compare molar dimorphism in Gorilla, Pongo, and Lufengpithecus to that in the papionin Mandrillus leucophaeus to test two hypotheses: (1) Pongo possesses the most size-dimorphic molars among living primates and (2) molar size dimorphism in Lufengpithecus is greater than that in the most dimorphic living primates. Our results show that M. leucophaeus exceeds great apes in its overall level of dimorphism and that L. lufengensis is more dimorphic than the extant species. Using these samples, we also evaluated molar dimorphism and taxonomic composition in two other Miocene ape samples-Ouranopithecus macedoniensis from Greece, specimens of which can be sexed based on associated canines and P(3)s, and the Sivapithecus sample from Haritalyangar, India. Ouranopithecus is more dimorphic than the extant taxa but is similar to Lufengpithecus, demonstrating that the level of molar dimorphism required for the Greek fossil sample under the single-species taxonomy is not unprecedented when the comparative framework is expanded to include extinct primates. In contrast, the Haritalyangar Siuapithecus sample, if it represents a single species, exhibits substantially greater molar dimorphism than does Lufengpithecus. Given these results, the taxonomic status of this sample remains equivocal. Am J Phys Anthropol 140:253-264, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Postconflict third-party affiliation in Canis lupus: do wolves share similarities with the great apes?,"['Palagi, E', 'Cordoni, G']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.07.017,OCT 2009,26,"Unsolicited third-party affiliation is defined as the first postconflict affinitive contact directed by bystanders to victims. To date, it has been found in apes and children but not in monkeys. We investigated the occurrence of unsolicited postconflict third-party affiliation in wolves, Canis lupus, and verified some functional hypotheses using a comparison with solicited contacts. Unsolicited affiliations were more frequent between individuals sharing good relationships and were reciprocated between partners (victims and third parties), thus suggesting the reciprocal nature of this mechanism (mutualistic behaviour). At an immediate level, in wolves unsolicited contacts provided benefits to the victim by breaking off aggression and restoring victims' social cohesiveness. The incidence of unsolicited interactions was affected by the presence of previous reconciliation. This result mirrors what has been found for the great apes, in which consolation may function as a partial alternative to reconciliation. Even though the cognitive skills at the basis of conflict resolution in canids still have to be investigated in detail, our study shows an unexpected similarity between wolves and the great apes.

Space use as an indicator of enclosure appropriateness: A novel measure of captive animal welfare,"['Ross, SR', 'Schapiro, SJ', 'Hau, J', 'Lukas, KE']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2009.08.007,OCT 2009,14,"Empirical measures of animal behavior and space use within the captive environment can provide critical information about animals' requirements, preferences and internal states. The trend toward naturalistic environments has shown promise in terms of behavioral benefits for animals such as great apes, and there have been several studies of the effects of complex environments on captive apes. However, few recent investigations have objectively compared environmental preferences between two distinct enclosures. In this study, we assessed how ape space use varied within and across two very different environments: an indoor, hardscape enclosure and an indoor/outdoor, naturalistic enclosure. Within-facility tests were conducted by comparing data from behavioral observations of the apes' position in the enclosures to measurements of the space and the availability of individual environmental elements. Between-facility comparisons utilized electivity index calculations to assess both the degree of use for specific features and the degree to which these selections strengthened or weakened in the new facility. Both gorillas and chimpanzees showed significant structural preferences in the older, hardscape environment: positioning themselves by mesh barriers (chimpanzees: P = 0.005; gorillas: P < 0.001) and corners (P = 0.005; gorillas: P < 0.001) more than would be expected by random spatial utilization, and avoiding open spaces (chimpanzees: P = 0.005; gorillas: P < 0.001) not adjacent to any physical structure. A new, naturalistic enclosure was constructed using preference data from the previous facility. In the new facility, both species of ape substantially altered the way in which they chose to position themselves in the enclosure. Chimpanzees used most of the environmental elements at rates more similar to the proportions they were available. While gorilla's preference corners was maintained in the new facility, preferences for doorways and mesh barriers disappeared. Comparing electivity indices facilitated an empirical comparison of space use preferences. Chimpanzees showed significant differences in how they used structural elements (P = 0.021), mesh barriers (P = 0.009) and corners (P = 0.016) in the new facility. Gorillas' environmental selections were similarly altered in the new facility, as selections of areas adjacent to doorways (P = 0.003). glass barriers (P = 0.005), structural elements (P < 0.001), and mesh barriers (P = 0.012) were all significantly affected by the transfer. This approach is useful for understanding how captive animals utilize their enclosures and we advocate that electivity indices can be added to a growing list of tools to assess the effect of captive environments on animal welfare.

Logging Concessions Can Extend the Conservation Estate for Central African Tropical Forests,"['Clark, CJ', 'Poulsen, JR', 'Malonga, R', 'Elkan, PW']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01243.x,OCT 2009,57,"The management of tropical forest in timber concessions has been proposed as a solution to prevent further biodiversity loss. The effectiveness of this strategy will likely depend on species-specific, population-level responses to logging. We conducted a survey (749 line transects over 3450 km) in logging concessions (1.2 million ha) in the northern Republic of Congo to examine the impact of logging on large mammal populations, including endangered species such as the elephant (Loxodonta africana), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), and bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus). When we estimated species abundance without consideration of transect characteristics, species abundances in logged and unlogged forests were not different for most species. When we modeled the data with a hurdle model approach, however, analyzing species presence and conditional abundance separately with generalized additive models and then combining them to calculate the mean species abundance, species abundance varied strongly depending on transect characteristics. The mean species abundance was often related to the distance to unlogged forest, which suggests that intact forest serves as source habitat for several species. The mean species abundance responded nonlinearly to logging history, changing over 30 years as the forest recovered from logging. Finally the distance away from roads, natural forest clearings, and villages also determined the abundance of mammals. Our results suggest that logged forest can extend the conservation estate for many of Central Africa's most threatened species if managed appropriately. In addition to limiting hunting, logging concessions must be large, contain patches of unlogged forest, and include forest with different logging histories."

Infanticide and social flexibility in the genus Gorilla,"['Yamagiwa, J', 'Kahekwa, J', 'Basabose, AK']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-009-0163-0,OCT 2009,11,"Based on the cases of infanticide by male mountain gorillas reported from the Virunga volcanic region, the socioecological and life history features of gorillas satisfy the conditions for which infanticide may be expected. However, there are considerable variations in the occurrence of infanticide between habitats. We analyze the recent reports of infanticides that were directly observed or are suspected based on field evidence in two populations of eastern and western lowland gorillas (Kahuzi and Mbeli Bai, respectively) along with previous reports on mountain gorillas, and consider which social features are linked with and which factors influence the occurrence of infanticide in the gorilla populations. All victims were suckling infants and most of them were killed by males who seemed unrelated to them. Dependent infants are most vulnerable to infanticide when the protector male (its putative father in most cases) is absent, and so male protection ability seems to be important in determining female transfer decisions. Two cases observed in Kahuzi suggest that the infanticidal male may discriminate between infants to accept and those to kill according to his previous interactions with their mothers. Mating for a prolonged period prior to parturition is necessary for immigrant females to avoid infanticide by the new male of the group that they join. Infanticide was usually associated with female transfer, and the patterns of female association at transfer may shape variations in social structure between populations. Female mountain gorillas prefer large groups with multiple males and tend to transfer alone in order to seek more protection against infanticide in Virunga. By contrast, female eastern and western lowland gorillas tend to transfer with other females to small groups or solitary males, and maturing silverbacks take females to establish new groups through group fission in Kahuzi and Mbeli Bai. These differences may result in more multi-male and larger groups in the Virungas than in Kahuzi and Mbeli Bai. Rapid changes in density of gorilla social units and their relations following drastic environmental changes caused by recent human disturbances may also increase the probability of infanticide."
Novel cytomegaloviruses in free-ranging and captive great apes: phylogenetic evidence for bidirectional horizontal transmission,"['Leendertz, FH', 'Deckers, M', 'Schempp, W', 'Lankester, F', 'Boesch, C', 'Mugisha, L', 'Dolan, A', 'Gatherer, D', 'McGeoch, DI', 'Ehlers, B']",JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY,10.1099/vir.0.011866-0,OCT 2009,17,"Wild great apes often suffer from diseases of unknown aetiology. This is among the causes of population declines. Because human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an important pathogen, especially in immunocompromised individuals, a search for cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) in deceased wild and captive chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans was performed. By using a degenerate PCR targeting four conserved genes (UL54-UL57), several distinct, previously unrecognized CMVs were found for each species. Sequences of up to 9 kb were determined for ten novel CMVs, located in the UL54-UL57 block. A phylogenetic tree was inferred for the ten novel CMVs, the previously characterized chimpanzee CMV, HCMV strains and Old World and New World monkey CMVs. The primate CMVs fell into four clades, containing New World monkey, Old World monkey, orang-utan and human CMVs, respectively, plus two clades that each contained both chimpanzee and gorilla isolates (termed CG1 and CG2). The tree loci of the first four clades mirrored those for their respective hosts in the primate tree, suggesting that these CMV lineages arose through cospeciation with host lineages. The CG1 and CG2 loci corresponded to those of the gorilla and chimpanzee hosts, respectively. This was interpreted as indicating that CG1 and CG2 represented CMV lineages that had arisen cospeciationally with the gorilla and chimpanzee lineages, respectively, with subsequent transfer within each clade between the host genera. Divergence dates were estimated and found to be consistent with overall cospeciational development of major primate CMV lineages. However, CMV transmission between chimpanzees and gorillas in both directions has also occurred."

We examined similar to 2 kb upstream of the translation start site within humans and non-human primates to obtain a fine resolution map of evolutionarily and functionally relevant cis-regulatory differences. our study investigated Macaca mulatta, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and Homo sapiens haplotypes using transient dual-luciferase transfection in three neuroblastoma cell lines to assay the impact of naturally occurring sequence variation on expression level. In addition to trans effects between cell lines, there are several significant expression differences between primate species, but the most striking difference was seen between human haplotypes in one cell line. Underlying this variation are numerous sequence polymorphisms, two of which influence expression within humans in a non-additive and cell line-specific manner. This study highlights functional consequences of tyrosine hydroxylase genetic variation in primates. Additionally, the results emphasize the importance of examining more than one cell line, the existence of multiple functional variants in a given promoter region and the presence of non-additive cis-interactions.

Comparing the Accuracy and Precision of Three Techniques Used for Estimating Missing Landmarks when Reconstructing Fossil Hominin Crania,"['Neeser, R', 'Ackermann, RR', 'Gain, J', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFRICANUS']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.21023,SEP 2009,13,"Various methodological approaches have been used for reconstructing fossil hominin remains in order to increase sample sizes and to better understand morphological variation. Among these, morphometric quantitative techniques for reconstruction are increasingly common. Here we compare the accuracy of three approaches-mean substitution, thin plate splines, and multiple linear regression-for estimating missing landmarks of damaged fossil specimens. Comparisons are made varying the number of missing landmarks, sample sizes, and the reference species of the population used to perform the estimation. The testing is performed on landmark data from individuals of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla, and nine hominin fossil specimens. Results suggest that when a small, same-species fossil reference sample is available to guide reconstructions, thin plate spline approaches perform best. However, if no such sample is available (or if the species of the damaged individual is uncertain), estimates of missing morphology based on a single individual (or even a small sample) of close taxonomic affinity are less accurate than those based on a large sample of individuals drawn from more distantly related extant populations using a technique (such as a regression method) able to leverage the information (e.g., variation/covariation patterning) contained in this large sample. Thin plate splines also show an unexpectedly large amount of error in estimating landmarks, especially over large areas. Recommendations are made for estimating missing landmarks under various scenarios. Am J Phys Anthropol 140:1-18, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Localization precision varies with the sound frequencies. As recency of common ancestry with human beings increases, primates have improved low-frequency sensitivity and reduced sensitivity to higher frequencies. The medial part of the MNTB is devoted to higher frequency processing. Thus, its high-frequency-dependent function is nearly lost in humans and its role in binaural processing as part of the contralateral pathway to the LSO remains questionable. Here, Nissl-stained sections of the superior olivary complex of man (Homo sapiens), bonobo (Pan paniscus), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), gibbon (Hylobates lar), and macaque (Macaca fascicularis) were compared to reveal differences and coincidences. From chimpanzees to humans, the size of the LSO decreased, and the MNTB as a compact nucleus nearly disappears. From chimpanzees to humans, the LSO/MNTB ratio increases dramatically too, whereas the LSO/MSO ratio remains 1.1; a finding that probably corresponds to the phylogenetic proximity between the species."
Can chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) discriminate appearance from reality?,"['Krachun, C', 'Call, J', 'Tomasello, M']",COGNITION,10.1016/j.cognition.2009.06.012,SEP 2009,6,"A milestone in human development is coming to recognize that how something looks is not necessarily how it is. We tested appearance-reality understanding in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with a task requiring them to choose between a small grape and a big grape. The apparent relative size of the grapes was reversed using magnifying and minimizing lenses so that the truly bigger grape appeared to be the smaller one. Our Lens test involved a basic component adapted from standard procedures for children, as well as several components designed to rule out alternative explanations. There were large individual differences in performance, with some chimpanzees' responses suggesting they appreciated the appearance-reality distinction. In contrast, all chimpanzees failed a Reverse Contingency control test, indicating that those who passed the Lens test did not do so by learning a simple reverse contingency rule. Four-year-old children given an adapted version of the Lens test failed it while 4.5-year-olds passed. Our study constitutes the first direct investigation of appearance-reality understanding in chimpanzees and the first cross-species comparison of this capacity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The amount of ILS depends on population parameters such as the ancestral effective population sizes and the recombination rate, but also on the number of generations between speciation events. We rise a hidden Markov model parameterized according to coalescent theory to infer the genealogy along a four species genome alignment of closely related species and estimate population parameters. We analyze a basic, panmictic demographic model and study its properties using an extensive set of coalescent simulations. We assess the effect of the model assumptions and demonstrate that the Markov property provides a good approximation to the ancestral recombination graph. Using a too restricted set of possible genealogies, necessary to reduce the computational load, can bias parameter estimates. We propose a simple correction for this bias and suggest directions for future extensions of the model. We show that the patterns of ILS along a sequence alignment can be recovered efficiently together with the ancestral recombination rate. Finally, we introduce an extension of the basic model that. allows for mutation rate heterogeneity and reanalyze human-chimpanzee-gorilla-orangutan alignments, using the new models. We expect that this framework will prove useful for population genomics and provide exciting insights into genome evolution."

Some key human-borne pathogens that have been shown to infect animals and cause morbidity and mortality include measles virus (paramyx-oviruses), influenza A virus (orthomyxoviruses), herpes simplex 1 virus (hypersviruses), protozoal and helminthic parasites, and bacteria Such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium. tuberculosis. However, zooanthroponotic pathogens are most commonly reported in captive animals or domestic livestock with close human contact; there, the potential for economic loss and human reinfection is most apparent. There is also the potential for infection in wild animal populations, which may threaten endangered species and decrease biodiversity. The emergence and reemergence of human-born pathogens in wildlife may also have negative consequences for human health if these pathogens cycle back into humans. Many of the anthropogenic drivers of zoonotic disease emergence also facilitate zooanthroponotic transmission. Increasing research to better understand the occurrence of and the potential for bidirectional pathogen transmission between humans and animals is essential for improving global health.

Ratcheting up the ratchet: on the evolution of cumulative culture,"['Tennie, C', 'Call, J', 'Tomasello, M']",PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rstb.2009.0052,AUG 27 2009,160,"Some researchers have claimed that chimpanzee and human culture rest on homologous cognitive and learning mechanisms. While clearly there are some homologous mechanisms, we argue here that there are some different mechanisms at work as well. Chimpanzee cultural traditions represent behavioural biases of different populations, all within the species' existing cognitive repertoire (what we call the 'zone of latent solutions') that are generated by founder effects, individual learning and mostly product-oriented (rather than process-oriented) copying. Human culture, in contrast, has the distinctive characteristic that it accumulates modifications over time (what we call the 'ratchet effect'). This difference results from the facts that (i) human social learning is more oriented towards process than product and (ii) unique forms of human cooperation lead to active teaching, social motivations for conformity and normative sanctions against non-conformity. Together, these unique processes of social learning and cooperation lead to humans' unique form of cumulative cultural evolution."

Under spatial reduction, primates can adopt various strategies to reduce social tension. Such strategies, which are not mutually exclusive, can involve avoidance and coping tactics. Recently, it has been shown that, during short-term crowding, bonobos may use both grooming and nonreproductive sexuality to avoid a potential rise in tension. Because bonobos are extremely playful, and play can be a risky activity, we tested whether play patterns were selectively avoided under space reduction. We collected daily data via focal animal sampling on a group of bonobos housed in the Apenheul Primate Park (Apeldoorn, The Netherlands) over a 12-month period. Among the adults, we found no difference in the contact play levels play fighting between the two space conditions (outdoors, 5000 m(2), and indoors, 230 m(2)), whereas indoors, there was a tendency toward an increase in locomotor-rotational play frequency. These findings indicate that bonobos do not adopt an avoidance tactic to reduce the risk involved in space reduction. Nevertheless, dyads showing higher rates of agonistic encounters were less likely to engage in contact play sessions. Even though it is difficult to affirm that space availability significantly induced higher playmate selectivity, we found that play signals significantly increased indoors, thus suggesting the need for a clearer 'declaration of intentions' in an unsafe situation.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of care style (responsive or basic) and caregiver type (ape or human) during the first 6 months on joint attention in 4 great ape species (Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo spp., and Pan pansicus). Great apes engaged in joint attention with conspecifics and humans regardless of the style of early care they experienced from either a great ape mother or human caregiver. This finding suggests that joint attention is a robust ability in great apes that is resilient against at least sonic differences in early care. Future studies using additional measures of early care quality are recommended."

During an outbreak of respiratory disease in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), and red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus) also staff members showed non-specific upper respiratory signs. One infant female chimpanzee with severe respiratory symptoms died despite immediate medical treatment and was submitted for necropsy.

Methods

Routine post mortem, histological and bacteriological examinations were conducted. Additionally lung tissue samples form the chimpanzee and swab samples from the staff members and the other primates were examined by PCR.

Results

A severe catarrhal to purulent bronchopneumonia and an interstitial pneumonia were found and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in lung samples by PCR. Swab samples from one animal keeper revealed the same HRSV sequence as of the chimpanzee.

Conclusions

Therefore, it is suggested that the outbreak of respiratory disease within a zoological institution was due to transmission of HRSV between both human and primates."

Sexual Behavior in Female Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla): Evidence for Sexual Competition,"['Stoinski, TS', 'Perdue, BM', 'Legg, AM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20692,JUL 2009,5,"Previous research in gorillas suggests that females engage in post-conception mating as a form of sexual competition designed to improve their own reproductive success. This study focused on sexual behaviors in a newly formed group of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) housed at Zoo Atlanta. All females engaged in mating outside their conceptive periods, although there was individual variation in the frequency of the behavior. An analysis of the presence/absence of sexual behavior found females, regardless of reproductive condition, were more likely to engage in sexual behavior on days when other females were sexually active. On these ""co-occurrence"" days, females were significantly more likely to solicit the silverback, but copulations did not differ from expectation. The results find further evidence for sexual competition among female gorillas and suggest that this may occur throughout their reproductive cycle rather than only during pregnancy. Am. J.

Great apes' performance in discriminating weight and achromatic color,"['Schrauf, C', 'Call, J']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-009-0216-1,JUL 2009,6,"Much work has been done on visual discrimination in primates over the past decade. In contrast, very little is known about the relevance of non-visual information in discrimination learning. We investigated weight and achromatic color (color, henceforth) discrimination in bonobos, gorillas and orangutans, using the exchange paradigm in which subjects have to give objects to the experimenter in order to receive a reward. Unlike previous studies, subjects were not trained to lift objects because lifting the objects was an integral part of the exchange procedure. This methodology also allowed us a direct comparison between visual and weight discrimination. We presented 12 subjects (5 bonobos, 2 gorillas and 5 orangutans) with two sets of objects corresponding to two conditions. The objects in the color condition (white/black) differed only in color and those in the weight condition (light/heavy) differed only in weight. Five apes learned to discriminate weight and six to discriminate color. Subjects learned color discrimination faster than weight discrimination. Our results suggest that bonobos and orangutans are sensitive to differences in weight and able to learn discriminating objects that differ in this property."
Discriminating between village and commercial hunting of apes,"['Kuehl, HS', 'Nzeingui, C', 'Yeno, SLD', 'Huijbregts, B', 'Boesch, C', 'Walsh, PD']",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,10.1016/j.biocon.2009.02.032,JUL 2009,14,"Hunting is the major driver of large mammal decline in Central African forests. in slowly reproducing species even low hunting pressure leaves spatial gradients with wildlife density increasing with distance from transport routes and human settlements. Park management can use this pattern formation to identify sources of threats, but also to discriminate between different threat scenarios, such as the impact of subsistence vs. commercial hunting. We conducted an ape survey in the mountainous Moukalaba Doudou National Park, Gabon, to evaluate whether potential population gradients would emanate from the three human population centers in the region or the villages surrounding the park. Using generalized linear modeling we found hill slope as a good predictor of ape nest occurrence probability and the distance to human population centers a better predictor of ape nest density and ape nest group size than distance to villages. In fact ape nest density was three times lower at the park borders close to the human population centers than in the park's interior. The results indicate that Moukalaba's ape population is more impacted by commercial than subsistence hunting and suggest that park management should focus conservation efforts on the human population centers. We conclude that in particular for slowly reproducing species geographic information on wildlife population gradients are of additional value for guiding protected area management. The hunting impact on those species might be easily underestimated, if derived only from market surveys or transport route controls, where they are only rarely found. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Over a 7-month period, the research team conducted a line-transect survey of the great ape population in the forests to the south of Grima to document their distribution. For comparison purposes, the team also surveyed a section of adjacent forest that had already been logged. Ape nests were significantly rarer in the logged forest than in the unlogged forest, and ape nests were most common in the more pristine forests to the south.

Positive Reinforcement Training Moderates Only High Levels of Abnormal Behavior in Singly Housed Rhesus Macaques,"['Baker, KC', 'Bloomsmith, M', 'Neu, K', 'Griffis, C', 'Maloney, M', 'Oettinger, B', 'Schoof, VAM', 'Martinez, M']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE,10.1080/10888700902956011,JUL-SEP 2009,11,"This study evaluated the application of positive reinforcement training (PRT) as an intervention for abnormal behaviors in singly housed laboratory rhesus macaques at 2 large primate facilities. Training involved basic control behaviors and body-part presentation. The study compared baseline behavioral data on 30 adult mates and 33 adult females compared with 3 treatment phases presented in counterbalanced order: 6 min per week of PRT, 20 or 40 min per week of PRT, and 6 min per week of unstructured human interaction (HI). Within-subject parametric tests detected no main or interaction effects involving experimental phase. However, among a subset of subjects with levels of abnormal in the top quartile of the range (n = 15), abnormal behavior was reduced from 35% to 25% of samples with PRT but not with HI. These results suggest that short durations of PRT applied as enrichment for this species and in this context may not in itself be sufficient intervention for abnormal behavior because levels remained high. However, it may be appropriate as an adjunct to other interventions and may be best targeted to the most severely affected individuals."

We examine this relationship by determining the strength of the correlation between selected skeletal dimensions and trunk volume. The findings indicate that sex should be taken into account when possible. Most two-predictor models perform better than most single-predictor models. Interspecific regressions based on log-transformed variables and sex/species-specific regression based on raw variables perform about equally well."
Buccal dental microwear variability in extant African Hominoidea: taxonomy versus ecology,"['Galbany, J', 'Estebaranz, F', 'Martinez, LM', 'Perez-Perez, A']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-009-0139-0,JUL 2009,14,"Buccal microwear patterns on teeth are good indicators of the abrasiveness of foodstuffs and have been used to trace the dietary habits of fossil species, including primates and hominids. However, few studies have addressed the variability of this microwear. The abrasiveness of dietary components depends not only on the hardness of the particles ingested, but also on the presence of dust and other exogenous elements introduced during food processing. These elements are responsible for the microwear typology observed on the enamel surfaces of primate teeth. Here we analyzed the variability of buccal microwear patterns in African Great Apes (Gorilla gorilla and Pan troglodytes), using tooth molds obtained from the original specimens held in several osteological collections. Our results suggest that ecological adaptations at subspecies or population level account for differences in microwear patterns, which are attributed to habitat and ecological conditions within populations rather than differences between species. The findings from studies on the variability of buccal dental microwear in extant species will contribute to a better understanding of extinct hominids' diet and ecology."
Hand-clapping as a communicative gesture by wild female swamp gorillas,"['Kalan, AK', 'Rainey, HJ']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-009-0130-9,JUL 2009,11,Hand-clapping is a form of gestural communication commonly observed in captive great apes yet only isolated instances of this behaviour have been documented in the wild. Nearly 20 years ago Fay recorded the first observations of hand-clapping in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in the Central African Republic. Here we present observations of Likouala swamp gorillas using hand-clapping as a form of gestural communication in previously undocumented contexts in the wild. We observed hand-clapping on four different occasions in four different groups. The hand-clap was always exhibited by an adult female and always consisted of two consecutive claps conducted in front of the body. We suggest the functional significance of the behaviour was to maintain and enforce group cohesiveness during instances of alarm. These observations suggest western lowland gorillas have a means of communicating that is thus far absent in their eastern counterparts (Gorilla beringei ssp.). This could be a gestural culture found only in western lowland gorillas which should be investigated further to shed light on the evolution of communication among hominoids.
The residual humanism of hybridity: retaining a sense of the earth,"['Lulka, D']",TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS,10.1111/j.1475-5661.2009.00346.x,JUL 2009,43,"The concept of hybridity has become an influential theoretical tool for examining and reconsidering relations between society and nature. Although benefits have accrued from this school of thought, this paper contends the deployment of hybridity within the geographic discipline falls short of its reconstitutional claims. These shortcomings are a consequence of the original sources used to develop the language and logic of hybridity. Although the concept of hybridity has a long history in the biological sciences, the utilisation of hybridity in the geographic discipline has predominantly relied upon evolving theories developed in science and technology studies. This paper indicates how Haraway's cyborg and Latour's Middle Kingdom limit the scope of hybridity by portraying humanity as central to hybridity. The pervasive centrality of humans within the literature on hybridity (1) limits the ability of geographers to embrace poststructuralism in its entirety and (2) diminishes the discipline's claim to credibly represent the (natural) landscape. This paper argues for a thicker hybridity by borrowing from emergent theories in the biological sciences, wherein hybridity is conceived as a common occurrence that frequently takes place outside the direct purview of society. Rather than reifying nature, thick hybridity forces society to embrace environmental uncertainty more than it has heretofore."

Although sample size constraints make interspecific comparisons difficult, postcranial differences between Australopithecus afarensis and Australopithecus africanus have been reported (McHenry and Berger: J Hum Evol 35 [1998] 1-22; Richmond et al.: J Hum Evol 43 [2002] 529-548; Green et al.: J Hum Evol 52 [2007] 187-200). Additional evidence indicates that the early members of the genus Homo show morphology like recent humans (e.g., Walker and Leakey: The Nariokotome Homo erectus skeleton. Cambridge: Harvard, 1993). Using a larger fossil sample than previous studies and novel methods, the early hominin proximal femur is newly examined to determine whether new data alter the current view of femoral evolution and inform the issue of interspecific morphological variation among australopiths. Two- and three-dimensional data are collected from large samples of recent humans, Pan, Gorilla, and Pongo and original fossil femora of Australopithecus, Paranthropus, and femora of African fossil Homo. The size-adjusted shape data are analyzed using principal components, thin plate spline analysis, and canonical variate analysis to assess shape variation. The results indicate that femora of fossil Homo are most similar to modern humans but share a low neck-shaft angle (NSA) with australopiths. Australopiths as a group have ape-like greater trochanter morphology. A. afarensis differs from R robustus and A. africanus in attributes of the neck and NSA. However, interspecific femoral variation is low and australopiths are generally morphologically similar. Although the differences are not dramatic, when considered in combination with other postcranial evidence, the adaptive differences among australopiths in craniodental morphology may have parallels in the postcranium.

However, small-bodied nocturnal species are not well represented on the long list of primates surveyed in the wild, and reproductive inferences regarding these animals in their natural habitats have not benefited from direct observations of hormonal changes. We collected fecal samples from female brown mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus) in a southeastern rainforest of Madagascar in order to determine whether or not fecally excreted steroid levels show a consistent pattern of change during the reproductive season and are a useful complement to reproductive observations in wild-trapped individuals. Initial data show variation in reproductive hormone levels before and after estrus and estimated day of parturition. Elevated levels of excreted estradiol (E(2)) were observed around the time of estrus, whereas high levels of fecal progesterone (P) were seen during later stages of pregnancy and around parturition. A more complete picture of reproductive profiles in female mouse lemurs, and how they may change over the life span, can be obtained if hormone analyses are used to supplement field observations. Am.

This ability develops in a protracted, mosaic fashion in humans. We review evidence of joint attention in humans and great apes, finding that great apes display every phenomenon described as joint attention in humans, although there is considerable variation among apes of different rearing histories. We conclude that there is little evidence for human species-unique cognitive adaptations in the non-verbal communication of humans in the first 18 months of life. This conclusion is consistent with the Narrative Practice Hypothesis (NPH) because the NPH posits training in folk psychological narratives as a basis for folk psychological competence."
Cervical necrotizing fasciitis and myositis in a western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Allender, MC', 'McCain, SL', 'Ramsay, EC', 'Schumacher, J', 'Ilha, MRS']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1111/j.1600-0684.2009.00337.x,JUN 2009,1,"A 39-yr-old wild-caught, female western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) died during an immobilization to assess swelling and apparent pain of the cervical region. Necropsy revealed a fistulous tract containing plant material in the oropharynx, above the soft palate, communicating with a left-sided cervical necrotizing fasciitis and myositis.

ESTABLISHMENT OF A CONTINUOUS CULTURE SYSTEM FOR ENTAMOEBA MURIS AND ANALYSIS OF THE SMALL SUBUNIT RRNA GENE,"['Kobayashi, S', 'Suzuki, J', 'Takeuchi, T']",PARASITE-JOURNAL DE LA SOCIETE FRANCAISE DE PARASITOLOGIE,NA,JUN 2009,2,"We established a culture system for Entamoeba muris (MG-EM-01 strain isolated from a Mongolian gerbil) using a modified Balamuth's egg yolk infusion medium supplemented with 4 % adult bovine serum and Bacteroides fragilis cocultured with Escherichia coli. Further, encystation was observed in the culture medium. The morphological characteristics of E. muris are similar to those of Entamoeba coli (E. coli); moreover, the malic isoenzyme electrophoretic bond, which shows species-specific electrophorelic mobility, of E. muris had almost the some mobility as that observed with the malic isoenzyme electrophorectic bond of E. coli (UZGE&01 strain isolated from a gorilla). We determined the small subunit rRNA (SSUrRNA) gene sequence of the MGEM-01 strain, and this sequence was observed to show 82.7 % homology with that of the UZG-EC-01 strain. Further, the resultant phylogenelic tree for molecular taxonomy based on the SSU-rRNA genes of the 21 strains of the intestinal parasitic amoeba species indicated that the MG-EM-01 strain was most closely related to E. coli."
Dimensions of the Foot Muscles in the Lowland Gorilla,"['Oishi, M', 'Ogihara, N', 'Endo, H', 'Komiya, T', 'Kawada, S', 'Tomiyama, T', 'Sugiura, Y', 'Ichihara, N', 'Asari, M']",JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL SCIENCE,NA,JUN 2009,4,"We dissected the hindlimb of a female western lowland gorilla and determined the muscle dimensions (mass, fascicle length, and physiological cross-sectional area: PCSA). Comparisons of the muscle parameters of the measured gorilla with corresponding reported human data demonstrated that the triceps surae muscles were larger and had more capacity to generate force than the other muscle groups in both species, but this tendency was more prominent in the human, probably as an adaptation to strong toe-off during bipedal walking. On the other hand, PCSAs of the extrinsic pedal digital flexors and digiti minimi muscles were larger in the western lowland gorilla, suggesting that the foot, particularly the fifth toe, has a relatively high grasping capability in the lowland gorilla."
Chimpanzee Malaria Parasites Related to Plasmodium ovale in Africa,"['Duval, L', 'Nerrienet, E', 'Rousset, D', 'Mba, SAS', 'Houze, S', 'Fourment, M', 'Le Bras, J', 'Robert, V', 'Ariey, F']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0005520,MAY 13 2009,31,"Since the 1970's, the diversity of Plasmodium parasites in African great apes has been neglected. Surprisingly, P. reichenowi, a chimpanzee parasite, is the only such parasite to have been molecularly characterized. This parasite is closely phylogenetically related to P. falciparum, the principal cause of the greatest malaria burden in humans. Studies of malaria parasites from anthropoid primates may provide relevant phylogenetic information, improving our understanding of the origin and evolutionary history of human malaria species. In this study, we screened 130 DNA samples from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) from Cameroon for Plasmodium infection, using cytochrome b molecular tools. Two chimpanzees from the subspecies Pan t. troglodytes presented single infections with Plasmodium strains molecularly related to the human malaria parasite P. ovale. These chimpanzee parasites and 13 human strains of P. ovale originated from a various sites in Africa and Asia were characterized using cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase 1 mitochondrial partial genes and nuclear ldh partial gene. Consistent with previous findings, two genetically distinct types of P. ovale, classical and variant, were observed in the human population from a variety of geographical locations. One chimpanzee Plasmodium strain was genetically identical, on all three markers tested, to variant P. ovale type. The other chimpanzee Plasmodium strain was different from P. ovale strains isolated from humans. This study provides the first evidence of possibility of natural cross-species exchange of P. ovale between humans and chimpanzees of the subspecies Pan t. troglodytes."
The evolution of primate visual self-recognition: evidence of absence in lesser apes,"['Suddendorf, T', 'Collier-Baker, E']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1098/rspb.2008.1754,MAY 7 2009,23,"Mirror self-recognition typically emerges in human children in the second year of life and has been documented in great apes. In contrast to monkeys, humans and great apes can use mirrors to inspect unusual marks on their body that cannot be seen directly. Here we show that lesser apes ( family Hylobatidae) fail to use the mirror to find surreptitiously placed marks on their head, in spite of being strongly motivated to retrieve directly visible marks from the mirror surface itself and from their own limbs. These findings suggest that the capacity for visual self-recognition evolved in a common ancestor of all great apes after the split from the line that led to modern lesser apes approximately 18 Myr ago. They also highlight the potential of a comparative approach for identifying the neurological and genetic underpinnings of self-recognition and other higher cognitive faculties."
Post-Conflict Third-Party Affiliation in Chimpanzees: What's in it for the Third Party?,"['Koski, SE', 'Sterck, EHM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20668,MAY 2009,18,"Affiliative behavior after conflicts between conflict participants and other group members is common in many primate species. The proposed functions for such triadic interactions are numerous, mostly concerning the benefit for the former conflict opponents. We investigated post-conflict third-party affiliation (TPA) in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with the aim of assessing what the affiliating third parties may gain from affiliation. Specifically, we tested whether third-party-initiated affiliation protects the third parties from further aggression by conflict opponents. We found support for this ""self-protection hypothesis,"" in that third parties selectively directed affiliation to those opponents who more often gave further aggression to them, and affiliation effectively decreased their chance of receiving aggression from these opponents. However, a subset of affiliation, provided to conflict victims by their own kin, appeared to not be self-protective and the function of it remained open. We conclude that chimpanzee third-party-initiated affiliation is a more ;heterogeneous behavior than thus far assumed. Am. J. Primatol. 71:409-418, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
"An experimental, comparative investigation of tool use in chimpanzees and gorillas","['Lonsdorf, EV', 'Ross, SR', 'Linick, SA', 'Milstein, MS', 'Melber, TN']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.01.020,MAY 2009,26,"Studies of ape tool use have been conducted in captivity since the early 1900s and in the wild since the 1960s. Chimpanzees are the most prolific tool users among the apes, and are known to use more tools than any other nonhuman animal. In contrast, reports of gorilla tool use are rare both in wild and captive settings. Studies of the processes involved in tool use learning have been limited in the wild by the lack of ability to control several unpredictable variables, and in captivity by tool use opportunities that are often presented in non-naturalistic contexts. We attempted to address both of these limitations by providing naive subjects with a naturalistic tool use device (built to simulate a termite mound) while housed in a more natural social setting to approximate how learning would occur in the wild. Both gorillas and chimpanzees participated in the experiment to allow comparative analyses of acquisition of tool behaviour and the factors that may affect acquisition. Both species showed low frequencies of interaction with the mound in the baseline condition, before baiting with a food reward. Once baited, chimpanzees both attempted and succeeded to extract the reward more quickly than did gorillas. The number of social group members at the mound was significantly higher for chimpanzees than for gorillas and may have affected skill acquisition. We advocate that comparative approaches to skill acquisition and learning are valuable, but that researchers need to be cognizant of species differences in social structure that may affect results.

"Gestural communication of the gorilla (Gorilla gorilla): repertoire, intentionality and possible origins","['Genty, E', 'Breuer, T', 'Hobaiter, C', 'Byrne, RW']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-009-0213-4,MAY 2009,73,"Social groups of gorillas were observed in three captive facilities and one African field site. Cases of potential gesture use, totalling 9,540, were filtered by strict criteria for intentionality, giving a corpus of 5,250 instances of intentional gesture use. This indicated a repertoire of 102 gesture types. Most repertoire differences between individuals and sites were explicable as a consequence of environmental affordances and sampling effects: overall gesture frequency was a good predictor of universality of occurrence. Only one gesture was idiosyncratic to a single individual, and was given only to humans. Indications of cultural learning were few, though not absent. Six gestures appeared to be traditions within single social groups, but overall concordance in repertoires was almost as high between as within social groups. No support was found for the ontogenetic ritualization hypothesis as the chief means of acquisition of gestures. Many gestures whose form ruled out such an origin, i.e. gestures derived from species-typical displays, were used as intentionally and almost as flexibly as gestures whose form was consistent with learning by ritualization. When using both classes of gesture, gorillas paid specific attention to the attentional state of their audience. Thus, it would be unwarranted to divide ape gestural repertoires into 'innate, species-typical, inflexible reactions' and 'individually learned, intentional, flexible communication'. We conclude that gorilla gestural communication is based on a species-typical repertoire, like those of most other mammalian species but very much larger. Gorilla gestures are not, however, inflexible signals but are employed for intentional communication to specific individuals."
Do gorillas regurgitate potentially-injurious stomach acid during 'regurgitation and reingestion?',"['Hill, SP']",ANIMAL WELFARE,NA,MAY 2009,5,"Regurgitation and reingestion (R/R) of foodstuffs is a common abnormal behaviour in captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and certain other non-human primates, but it is not part of their normal feeding mechanism. It is similar to a behavioural problem seen in humans, human rumination syndrome (HRS), which can occur in association with anxiety or a poor relationship with a caregiver. Patients with HRS often regurgitate stomach acid with the food matter which can result in clinical problems; until this study, it was not known if stomach acid is regurgitated by gorillas also. Thus, samples of regurgitated matter were collected opportunistically and non-invasively, and pH was measured using an electronic meter. Results were compared with the pH of samples of the original food eaten by the gorillas, and show that regurgitated food has significantly higher acidity than the originally-ingested meal. By comparison, samples of saliva were collected from gorillas opportunistically, in the absence of recent ingestion, and were found to be alkaline and, thus, saliva should not have contributed to the increased acidity of regurgitated matter. The results imply that stomach acid is being regurgitated. as in human patients with potentially-injurious rumination syndrome, and it is indicative of sub-optimal welfare. Causes and effects of R/R should be investigated further, to lead to potential treatment and prevention and to promote the welfare of captive gorillas."

Oligosaccharides containing the type II unit (Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc) were found exclusively (gorilla and siamang) or predominately (chimpanzee, bonobo, and orangutan) over those containing the type I unit (Gal(beta 1-3)GlcNAc). In comparison, type I oligosaccharides predominate over type II oligosaccharides in human milk, whereas nonprimate milk almost always contains only type II oligosaccharides. The milk or colostrum of the great apes contained oligosaccharides bearing both N-glycolylneuraminic acid and N-acetylneuraminic acid, whereas human milk contains only the latter. Great ape milk, like that of humans, contained fucosylated oligosaccharides whereas siamang milk did not. Since these analyses are based on a limited number of individuals, further research on additional samples of great and lesser ape milk is needed to confirm phylogenetic patterns."

The aims were: (a) to find out if great apes are subject to gravity biased search or display sensitivity for object solidity, (b) to check for species differences, and (c) to assess if a gravity hypothesis or more parsimonious explanations best account for failures observed. Results indicate that great apes, unlike monkeys, show no reliable gravity bias, that ape species slightly differ in terms of their performance, and that the errors made are best explained by a gravity account."
Reproductive Aging in Captive and Wild Common Chimpanzees: Factors Influencing the Rate of Follicular Depletion,"['Atsalis, S', 'Videan, E', 'NATURAL MENOPAUSE']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20650,APR 2009,15,"We examine and discuss evidence of contrasting differences in fertility patterns between captive and wild female chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, as they age; in the wild females reproduce in their 40s, but captive studies suggest that menopause occurs around that time. Thus, despite the increased longevity generally observed in captive populations reproductive life span is shortened. We outline a hypothesis to explain the apparent differential pace of reproductive decline observed between wild and captive populations. The breeding schedules of captive primates may contribute to accelerated reproductive senescence because continuous cycling in captive animals results in early depletion of the ovarian stock and premature senescence. Available evidence supports the hypothesis that women with patterns of high oocyte loss experience earlier menopause. Chimpanzees in captivity live longer, and thus, similar to humans, they may experience follicular depletion that precedes death by many years. In captivity, chimpanzees typically have an early age at menarche and first birth, shorter interbirth intervals associated with short lactational. periods as young mature faster, and nursery rearing, which allows mothers to begin cycling earlier. Variables typical of wild chimpanzee populations, including late age at menarche and first birth, long interbirth intervals associated with prolonged lactational periods, and a long period of female infertility after immigration, spare ovulations and may be responsible for the later age at reproductive termination. Finally, we describe and discuss the timing of specific reproductive landmarks that occur as female chimpanzees age, distinguishing between functional menopause (age at last birth) and operational menopause (end of cycling).

Leave or conceive: natal dispersal and philopatry of female mountain gorillas in the Virunga volcano region,"['Robbins, AM', 'Stoinski, T', 'Fawcett, K', 'Robbins, MM']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.12.005,APR 2009,16,"Natal dispersal is often attributed to inbreeding avoidance, competition for resources or competition for mates, but the patterns and frequency of dispersal vary considerably among and even within species. We examined the possible reasons for dispersal and philopatry of natal nulliparous female mountain gorillas, Gorilla gorilla beringei, in the Virunga volcano region, including comparisons with non-natal and/or parous females. Competition among females is generally weak and ineffective in this population, and inbreeding avoidance has been considered the ultimate cause of natal dispersal. Yet fewer than half of nulliparous females left their natal group when the dominant male was old enough to be their father, so they did not rely entirely upon dispersal to avoid such risk of inbreeding. Almost all natal nulliparous females were with at least one sexually active male who was not old enough to be their father, so the presence or absence of such mating alternatives also did not determine whether they left. Natal nulliparous females were more likely to leave groups with only one adult male, where infanticide losses have been higher than in multimale groups. Thus natal dispersal seemed to be influenced by infanticide avoidance, which has been considered the ultimate cause of secondary dispersal. Natal nulliparous females have more time to encounter suitable destinations than other females, which may be a proximate reason why they were more likely to transfer despite having the same ultimate cause of dispersal.

Milk composition of captive vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) and rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) with observations on gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and white handed gibbon (Hylobates lar),"['Osthoff, G', 'Hugo, A', 'de Wit, M', 'Nguyen, TPM', 'Seier, J']",COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cbpb.2008.12.015,APR 2009,7,"The nutrient content and fatty acid composition of vervet monkey milk has been determined and is compared with rhesus macaque, and two hominoid apes, the white handed gibbon and gorilla. With 15.7 +/- 4.1 g protein, 33.1 +/- 9.4 g fat, and 85.1 +/- 7.5 g lactose per kg milk, vervet monkey milk does not differ from that of rhesus macaque, and is within the range of other primates. Small amounts (> 1 g kg(-1)) of oligosaccharides, glucose, galactose and fucose were noted. In comparison, gorilla milk has a low fat content of 13.8 g kg(-1), but contains high levels of oligosaccha rides at 7.0 g kg(-1) milk. The hominoid partner, the white handed gibbon, contains no oligosaccha rides and a milk fat content similar to other hominoid species. Differences between vervet monkey and rhesus macaque milks were observed in the electrophoretic pattern of the milk proteins, mainly amongst the kappa- and gamma-caseins, which also differ from that of the hominids. The fatty acid contents of these milks differ from studies where a natural diet of leafy material was available in that a low content of alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) was noted. A phylogenetic effect is observed for the content of 8:0, 10:0 fatty acids between the Cercopithecidae and Hominoidea, and a further phylogenetic effect suggested between the Hylobatidae and Hominidae.

Elucidating Population Histories Using Genomic DNA Sequences,"['Vigilant, L']",CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1086/592025,APR 2009,2,"In 1993, Cliff Jolly suggested that rather than debating species definitions and classifications, energy would be better spent investigating multidimensional patterns of variation and gene flow among populations. Until now, however, genetic studies of wild primate populations have been limited to very small portions of the genome. Access to complete genome sequences of humans, chimpanzees, macaques, and other primates makes it possible to design studies surveying substantial amounts of DNA sequence variation at multiple genetic loci in representatives of closely related but distinct wild primate populations. Such data can be analyzed with new approaches that estimate not only when populations diverged but also the relative amounts and directions of subsequent gene flow. These analyses will reemphasize the difficulty of achieving consistent species and subspecies definitions by revealing the extent of variation in the amount and duration of gene flow accompanying population divergences."
"Nesting Behavior of Gorilla gorilla diehli at Kagwene Mountain, Cameroon: Implications for Assessing Group Size and Density","['Sunderland-Groves, JL', 'Ekinde, A', 'Mboh, H']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-009-9340-7,APR 2009,9,"We recorded nesting data at 569 fresh night nest sites, comprising 7032 individual nests, of Cross River gorillas inhabiting the Kagwene Mountain in western Cameroon. The mean night nest group size was 12.4. Overall, 55% of night nests were constructed on the ground and 45% in trees. Significantly more arboreal nests were constructed in the wet season (69%), vs. the dry season (19%). Day nest construction was common at Kagwene (n = 260 nest sites, mean nest group size = 5.98) and we encountered significantly more day nest sites in the wet season. Nest site reuse was also common (35%), though not related to season. Our results of nesting habits concur with those from other western gorilla studies, in which rainfall influences arboreal nesting. However, we encountered wet season arboreal nesting, day nest construction, and overall nest site reuse more frequently than reported for other sites. Our observations have considerable implications when estimating group size and density using traditional nest count data. The gorillas at Kagwene inhabit the highest altitudinal range of all Cross River gorilla subpopulations and rainfall is also high; therefore other subpopulations may demonstrate different nesting characteristics. However, one should consider our findings when attempting to estimate Cross River gorilla density at other localities through nest site data."

Dental microwear texture analysis of two families of subfossil lemurs from Madagascar,"['Scott, JR', 'Godfrey, LR', 'Jungers, WL', 'Scott, RS', 'Simons, EL', 'Teaford, MF', 'Ungar, PS', 'Walker, A']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.11.003,APR 2009,36,"This study employs dental microwear texture analysis to reconstruct the diets of two families of subfossil lemurs from Madagascar, the archaeolemurids and megalaclapids. This technique is based on three-dimensional surface measurements utilizing a white-light confocal profiler and scale-sensitive fractal analysis. Data were recorded for six texture variables previously used successfully to distinguish between living primates with known dietary differences. Statistical analyses revealed that the archaeolemurids and megalaclapids have overlapping microwear texture signatures, suggesting that the two families occasionally depended on resources with similar mechanical properties. Even so. moderate variation in most attributes is evident, and results Suggest potential differences in the foods consumed by the two families. The microwear pattern for the megalaclapids indicates a preference for tougher foods, such as many leaves, while that of the archaeolemurids is consistent with the consumption of harder foods. The results also indicate some intraspecific differences among taxa within each family. This evidence suggests that the archaeolemurids and megalaclapids, like many living primates, likely consumed a variety of food types. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Using genetics to understand the dynamics of wild primate populations,"['Vigilant, L', 'Guschanski, K']",PRIMATES,10.1007/s10329-008-0124-z,APR 2009,13,"While much can be learned about primates by means of observation, the slow life history of many primates means that even decades of dedicated effort cannot illuminate long-term evolutionary processes. For example, while the size of a contemporary population can be estimated from field censuses, it is often desirable to know whether a population has been constant or changing in size over a time frame of hundreds or thousands of years. Even the nature of ""a population"" is open to question, and the extent to which individuals successfully disperse among defined populations is also difficult to estimate by using observational methods alone. Researchers have thus turned to genetic methods to examine the size, structure, and evolutionary histories of primate populations. Many results have been gained by study of sequence variation of maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, but in recent years researchers have been increasingly focusing on analysis of short, highly variable microsatellite segments in the autosomal genome for a high-resolution view of evolutionary processes involving both sexes. In this review we describe some of the insights thus gained, and discuss the likely impact on this field of new technologies such as high-throughput DNA sequencing."
Gorillas' (Gorilla gorilla) use of experimenter-given manual and facial cues in an object-choice task,"['Byrnit, JT']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-008-0200-1,MAR 2009,10,"Several experiments have been performed to examine the great apes' use of experimenter-given manual and visual cues in object-choice tasks. Considering their use of referential gestures in gaze-following paradigms, great apes perform surprisingly unsuccessfully in object-choice tasks. However, the large majority of object-choice experiments have been conducted with chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with very few experiments including other great ape species, making it difficult to generalize about the great apes. Interestingly, the only object-choice task conducted with gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) has indicated successful use of both manual and visual cues. It was the aim of the present study to gather more data on gorillas' use of human manual and facial cues on the object-choice task. Gorilla subjects in this study did not show consistent use of three types of referential cues."

First contact: Understanding the relationship between hominoid incisor curvature and diet,"['Deane, A', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2009.01.006,MAR 2009,9,"Accurately interpreting fossil primate dietary behaviour is necessary to fully understand a species' ecology and connection to its environment. Traditional methods developed to infer diet from hominoid teeth successfully group taxa into broad dietary categories (i.e., folivore, frugivore) but often fail to represent the range of dietary variability characteristic of living apes. This oversimplification is not only a consequence of poor resolution, but may also reflect the use of similar fallback resources by closely related taxa with dissimilar diets. This study demonstrates that additional dietary specificity can be achieved using a morphometric approach to hominoid incisor curvature. High-resolution polynomial curve fitting (HR-PCF) was used to quantify the incisor curvatures of closely related hominoid taxa that have dissimilar diets but similar morphological adaptations to specific keystone resources (e.g., Gorilla gorilla beringei vs. G. g. gorilla). Given the key role of incisors in food processing, it is reasonable to assume that these teeth will be at least partially influenced by the unique selective pressures imposed by the mechanical loading specific to individual diets. Results from this study identify a strong correlation between hominoid dietary proportions and incisor linear dimensions and curvature, indicating that more pronounced incisor curvature is positively correlated with higher levels of frugivory. Hard-object frugivores have the greatest mesiodistal and cervico-incisal curvature and dedicated folivores have the least curved incisors. Mixed folivore/frugivores are morphological intermediates between dedicated folivores and hard- and soft-object frugivores. Mesiodistal curvature varied only in the degree of curvature; however, cervico-incisal curvature was shown to differ qualitatively between more frugivorous and more falivorous taxa. In addition to identifying a greater range of dietary variability among hominoids, this study also demonstrates that HR-PCF is capable of identifying morphological distinctions between closely related taxa with overlapping diets that rely on similar fallback foods (e.g., Pan paniscus vs. P. troglodytes).

Facility Design for Bachelor Gorilla Groups,"['Coe, JC', 'Scott, D', 'Lukas, KE']",ZOO BIOLOGY,10.1002/zoo.20233,MAR-APR 2009,5,"This paper emerged from discussions following the Bachelor Gorilla 2000 Workshop Facility Design sessions. Although many ape facility design features are common to all gorillas, the purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of special needs of bachelor gorillas. For example, managing escalating aggression between maturing or silverback males may require a high degree of caregiver intervention and thus easy access to gorillas both on- and off-exhibit is beneficial. Facility design features that reduce contact aggression, increase affiliation, provide visual barriers or escape routes, and allow safe outlets for species-typical behavior are essential to the successful management of bachelor gorilla groups in zoos. Such provisions permit caregivers the ability to constantly monitor and modify the zoo environment to meet rapidly changing husbandry needs.

Origin and Biology of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus in Wild-Living Western Gorillas,"['Takehisa, J', 'Kraus, MH', 'Ayouba, A', 'Bailes, E', 'Van Heuverswyn, F', 'Decker, JM', 'Li, Y', 'Rudicell, RS', 'Learn, GH', 'Neel, C', 'Ngole, EM', 'Shaw, GM', 'Peeters, M', 'Sharp, PM', 'Hahn, BH']",JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,10.1128/JVI.02311-08,FEB 15 2009,66,"Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) are infected with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVgor) that is closely related to chimpanzee and human immunodeficiency viruses (SIVcpz and HIV-1, respectively) in west central Africa. Although existing data suggest a chimpanzee origin for SIVgor, a paucity of available sequences has precluded definitive conclusions. Here, we report the molecular characterization of one partial (BQ664) and three full-length (CP684, CP2135, and CP2139) SIVgor genomes amplified from fecal RNAs of wild-living gorillas at two field sites in Cameroon. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all SIVgor strains clustered together, forming a monophyletic lineage throughout their genomes. Interestingly, the closest relatives of SIVgor were not SIVcpzPtt strains from west central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) but human viruses belonging to HIV-1 group O. In trees derived from most genomic regions, SIVgor and HIV-1 group O formed a sister clade to the SIVcpzPtt lineage. However, in a tree derived from 5' pol sequences (similar to 900 bp), SIVgor and HIV-1 group O fell within the SIVcpzPtt radiation. The latter was due to two SIVcpzPtt strains that contained mosaic pol sequences, pointing to the existence of a divergent SIVcpzPtt lineage that gave rise to SIVgor and HIV-1 group O. Gorillas appear to have acquired this lineage at least 100 to 200 years ago. To examine the biological properties of SIVgor, we synthesized a full-length provirus from fecal consensus sequences. Transfection of the resulting clone (CP2139.287) into 293T cells yielded infectious virus that replicated efficiently in both human and chimpanzee CD4(+) T cells and used CCR5 as the coreceptor for viral entry. Together, these results provide strong evidence that P. t. troglodytes apes were the source of SIVgor. These same apes may also have spawned the group O epidemic; however, the possibility that gorillas served as an intermediary host cannot be excluded."
Western Lowland Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) Change Their Activity Patterns in Response to Frugivory,"['Masi, S', 'Cipolletta, C', 'Robbins, MM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20629,FEB 2009,41,"The most important environmental factor explaining interspecies variation in ecology and sociality of the great apes is likely to be variation in resource availability. Relatively little is known about the activity patterns of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), which inhabit a dramatically different environment from the well-studied mountain gorillas (G. beringei beringei). This study aims to provide a detailed quantification of western lowland gorillas' activity budgets using direct observations on one habituated group in Bai Hokou, Central African Republic. We examined how activity patterns of both sexes are shaped by seasonal frugivory. Activity was recorded with 5-min instantaneous sampling between December 2004 and December 2005. During the high-frugivory period the gorillas spent less time feeding and more time traveling than during the low-frugivory period. The silverback spent less time feeding but more time resting than both females and immatures, which likely results from a combination of social and physiological factors. When compared with mountain gorillas, western lowland gorillas spend more time feeding (67 vs. 55%) and traveling (12 vs. 6.5%), but less time resting (21 vs. 34%) and engaging in social/other activities (0.5 vs. 3.6%). This disparity in activity budgets of western lowland gorillas and mountain gorillas may be explained by the more frugivorous diet and the greater dispersion of food resources experienced by western lowland gorillas. Like other apes, western lowland gorillas change their activity patterns in response to changes in the diet. Am. J. Primatol. 71:91-100, 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Comparison of life-history patterns of closely related species living in diverse environments helps to evaluate the validity of these assumptions but empirical data are lacking. The two gorilla species exhibit substantial differences in their environment, which allows investigation into the role of increased frugivory in shaping western gorilla life histories. We present behavioral and morphological data on western gorilla physical maturation and life-history parameters from a 12.5-year study at Mbeli Bai, a forest clearing in the Nouabale-Ndoki National Park in northern Congo. We assign photographs of known individuals to different life-history classes and propose new age boundaries for life-history classes in western gorillas, which can be used and tested at other western gorilla research sites. Our results show that western gorillas are weaned at a later age compared with mountain gorillas and indicate slower physical maturation of immatures. These findings support the risk-aversion hypothesis for more frugivorous species. However, our methods need to be applied and tested with other gorilla populations. The slow life histories of western gorillas could have major consequences for social structure, mortality patterns and population growth rates that will affect recovery from population crashes of this critically endangered species. We emphasize that long-term studies can provide crucial demographic and life-history data that improve our understanding of life-history evolution and adaptation and help to refine conservation strategies.

Benefits of training/playing therapy in a group of captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Carrasco, L', 'Colell, M', 'Calvo, M', 'Abello, MT', 'Velasco, M', 'Posada, S']",ANIMAL WELFARE,NA,FEB 2009,9,"Animal well-being and enrichment continue to gain importance in the maintenance of primates living in captivity. Positive reinforcement training (PRT) and/or playing interaction have been shown to be effective in improving the well-being of several species of primates. This research study evaluated the effects of applying a combination of these two techniques (training/playing therapy) on a group of lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). The effects of this combination on the behaviour of captive primates have been given very little attention to date, The behaviour of a group of seven females was recorded in two different phases at Barcelona Zoo: before (periods I and 2) and after (periods 3 and 4) a series of changes were made to the composition of this social group. In each period, two phases were distinguished: i) baseline condition, after the subjects became used to the researcher, focal recordings were made of the group's regular behaviour and, ii) experimental condition, the training and playing sessions ('gorilla play') with two specific subjects began one hour before the group went to the outdoor facility. The frequency and duration of the behaviour observed in each of the recording conditions were compared. The results showed positive changes in the gorillas' behaviour. stereotypies, interactions with the public, aggression between subjects and inactivity were all reduced, while affiliative behaviour and individual and social play-related behaviour increased. Moreover, the benefits of this therapy were observed in trained individuals and the rest of the gorillas in the group, which would seem to indicate that training/playing can be used to create a more relaxed atmosphere, reducing social tension and improving the well-being of all the subjects involved."
Great apes' capacities to recognize relational similarity,"['Haun, DBM', 'Call, J']",COGNITION,10.1016/j.cognition.2008.10.012,FEB 2009,21,"Recognizing relational similarity relies on the ability to understand that defining object properties might not lie in the objects individually, but in the relations of the properties of various object to each other. This aptitude is highly relevant for many important human skills such as language, reasoning, categorization and understanding analogy and metaphor. In the current study, we investigated the ability to recognize relational similarities by testing five species of great apes, including human children in a spatial task. We found that all species performed better if related elements are connected by logico-causal as opposed to non-causal relations. Further, we find that only children above 4 years of age, bonobos and chimpanzees, unlike younger children, gorillas and orangutans display some mastery of reasoning by non-causal relational similarity. We conclude that recognizing relational similarity is not in its entirety unique to the human species. The lack of a capability for language does not prohibit recognition of simple relational similarities. The data are discussed in the light of the phylogenetic tree of relatedness of the great apes.

Object permanence in dogs: Invisible displacement in a rotation task,"['Miller, HC', 'Gipson, CD', 'Vaughan, A', 'Rayburn-Reeves, R', 'Zentall, TR']",PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW,10.3758/PBR.16.1.150,FEB 2009,17,"Dogs were tested for object permanence using an invisible displacement in which an object was hidden in one of two containers at either end of a beam and the beam was rotated. Consistent with earlier research, when the beam was rotated 180 degrees, the dogs failed to find the object. However, when the beam was rotated only 90, they were successful. Furthermore, when the dogs were led either 90 degrees or 180 degrees around the apparatus, they were also successful. In a control condition, when the dogs could not see the direction of the 90 degrees rotation, they failed to find the object. The results suggest that the 180 degrees rotation may produce an interfering context that can be reduced by rotating the apparatus only 90 degrees or by changing the dogs' perspective. Once the conflict is eliminated, dogs show evidence of object permanence that includes invisibly displaced objects."

Despite a substantial database, manual laterality in non-human primates remains a controversial topic. We give here a review of the main findings on manual preference in great apes. This article presents data on hand preferences for a bimanual coordination in 29 bonobos (Pan paniscus). The study aims to provide data on manual laterality for a complex bimanual task in this very interesting and rarely studied species. Hand preferences were assessed using the 'tube task'. This task has been used with other species, which allows reliable data comparisons. The task requires a bimanual Coordinated precise action: the subject holds the tube with one]land while reaching for food inside with the other hand. As a complex task, this measure has been shown to be efficient in revealing and preferences. It has revealed group-level right bias in chimpanzees. Bonobos had never been tested. We recorded both independent bouts (counting only the first pattern of a sequence of identical actions) and frequency (counting every action). The bonobos exhibited strong hand preferences. With frequency, 11 bonobos were classified as right-handed, 15 were left-handed and 3 had no preference. With bouts, 8 bonobos were right-handed, 9 were left-handed and 12 had no preference.

Allometry of Facial Mobility in Anthropoid Primates: Implications for the Evolution of Facial Expression,"['Dobson, SD']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20902,JAN 2009,13,"Body size may be an important factor influencing the evolution of facial expression in anthropoid primates due to allometric constraints on the perception of facial movements. Given this hypothesis, I tested the prediction that observed facial mobility is positively correlated with body size in a comparative sample of nonhuman anthropoids. Facial mobility, or the variety of facial movements a species can produce, was estimated using a novel application of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). I used FACS to estimate facial mobility in 12 nonhuman anthropoid species, based on video recordings of facial activity in zoo animals. Body mass data were taken from the literature. I used phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) to perform a multiple regression analysis with facial mobility as the dependent variable and two independent variables: log body mass and dummy-coded infraorder. Together, body mass and infraorder explain 92% of the variance in facial mobility. However, the partial effect of body mass is much stronger than for infraorder. The results of my study suggest that allometry is an important constraint on the evolution of facial mobility, which may limit the complexity of facial expression in smaller species. More work is needed to clarify the perceptual bases of this allometric pattern. Am J Phys Anthropol 138:70-81., 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

In the majority of studies of the CT contents of primate foods, a tannin source such as ""quebracho"" is used to standardize CT assays, but the CT in quebracho tannin may not be similar to those in the plants of interest. We investigated how the choice of standard to calibrate CT assays affects the estimation of CT in the diets of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei). We purified the CT from gorilla foods and compared the actual amounts of CT in the foods with estimates produced by using the quebracho tannin. When quebracho was used, the estimates of CT contents of gorilla foods were, on average, 3.6 times the actual content of CT so that the amounts in frequently eaten gorilla foods were substantially overestimated. The overestimation for a given plant could not be predicted reliably and the ranking of plants by tannin content differed according to the standard used. Our results demonstrate that accurate measurements of CT necessitate the use of tannins purified from the plant species of interest. A reevaluation of primatology studies using interspecific comparisons of tannin content will provide new insights into primate food selection and nutritional ecology. Am. J. Primatol. 71:70-76, 2009.

In human chromosomes, centromeric regions, generally containing highly repetitive DNAs, are characterized by the presence of specific human DNA sequences and an absence of homology with gorilla DNA sequences. The only exception is the pericentromeric area of human chromosome 9, which, in addition to a large block of human DNA, also contains a region of homology with gorilla DNA sequences; the localization of these sequences coincides with that of human satellite III. Since highly repetitive DNAs are known for their high mutation frequency, we hypothesized that the chromosome 9 pericentromeric DNA conserved in human chromosomes and deriving from the gorilla genome may thus play some important functional role.

A Non-Human Primate BAC Resource to Study Interchromosomal Segmental Duplications,"['Kirsch, S', 'Hodler, C', 'Schempp, W']",CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH,10.1159/000235930,2009,1,"Segmental duplications (SDs) are involved in the reshaping and evolutionary development of primate genome architecture. Their intrinsic property to promote genomic instability facilitates genome rearrangements, thereby contributing to karyotype diversity in primates. However, comparative analyses of SDs based on whole-genome shotgun assemblies of primate genomes may lead to a distorted view of their evolutionary dynamics as this method will incorrectly assemble or simply not represent these regions. Therefore high-quality sequences of chromosomally assigned SDs are indispensable for unraveling the amplification and dispersal pattern of SDs during primate evolution. Here, we use an updated version of the ancestral duplicon state of the non-palindromic SDs of all 4 human Y-chromosome euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions to perform a survey of duplicons genome-wide across 7 primate species. By adjusting experimental conditions to the mean nucleotide sequence divergence to human we identified 11,075 BAC clones carrying primate orthologs or paralogs of human Y chromosome-derived duplicons. Preliminary results indicate lineage-specific amplification of duplicons in prosimians and gibbons. This BAC-based framework represents the first complete set of a defined number of duplicons over 60 million years of primate evolution. Comparative sequence analysis of this genetic resource can contribute to our deeper understanding of the impact of segmental duplications on primate genome evolution. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

We report a case of innovation in thistle leaf processing by a subadult female mountain gorilla in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. This technique involved rolling the thistle leaves into a ball between her palms prior to putting them in her mouth, as opposed to the standard method of folding leaves. All other weaned individuals (n = 13) were observed to use the standard method to process thistle leaves as described in Byrne et al. While the subadult female emigrated out of the research group 6 months after she had first been observed using the innovative technique, preventing observations of possible transmission within the group, it adds to the debate of whether food processing techniques used by gorillas are socially learned or not.

Our study focused on CT intake in two groups of Lemur catta residing in spiny forest habitat during two reproductive periods. We examined whether L. catta in this habitat avoided plant foods high in CT, and whether reproductive females ingested lower concentrations of CT compared with males, since CT consumption compromises protein absorption. Feeding data and plant food samples were collected during reproductive periods in 2006 (early/mid-lactation) and 2007 (early gestation). Food samples were assayed for CT content, and average CT intake was determined for all focal animals. No significant difference was found in CT content of the most commonly consumed foods compared with other foods in each season or between seasons. No sex differences occurred in CT consumption in either reproductive period. These L. catta did not avoid plant foods high in CT, and three strategies-ingesting small amounts of CT regularly, high amounts only over short periods, and geophagy-may assist these lemurs in coping with CT content in their highly seasonal diet. L. catta may also be somewhat physiologically adapted to cope with CT concentrations in their plant foods. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel"
The Kinematics of Load Carrying in Humans and Great Apes: Implications for the Evolution of Human Bipedalism,"['Watson, J', 'Payne, R', 'Chamberlain, A', 'Jones, R', 'Sellers, WI']",FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA,10.1159/000258646,2009,7,"We present a comparison of loaded and unloaded carrying kinematics in humans, common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus), western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and Bornean and Sumatran orang-utans (Pongo pygmaeus and Pongo abelii). Human hindlimb joint and segment angles were collected during treadmill locomotion using infrared motion analysis cameras. Non-human primate fore-and hindlimb joint and segment angles were collected at zoos during free-ranging locomotion using a standard video camera. In quadrupedal locomotion there were small but potentially important changes associated with load carriage leading to a more upright trunk and a shift in shoulder excursion. These changes were exacerbated as locomotion shifts from quadrupedal to tripedal and bipedal gaits when carrying more awkward loads suggesting a possible adaptive sequence. However, food carrying may favour a highly flexed bent-hip bent-knee bipedal gait since it allows simultaneous foraging and hoarding. In bipedal humans no changes in limb kinematics were seen associated with type of load, although asymmetric loads may lead to lateral postural shifts. Carrying may therefore be an important component of the evolutionary shift to habitual bipedalism, although further work is needed to understand the full biomechanical implications.

The nature of the segments shared by different sets of human subtelomeres reflects their high rate of recent interchromosomal exchange. Here, we characterize the rearrangements incurred by the 15q subtelomere after it arose from a chromosome fission event in the common ancestor of great apes. We used FISH, sequencing of genomic clones, and PCR to map the breakpoint of this fission and track the fate of flanking sequence in human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and macaque genomes. The ancestral locus, a cluster of olfactory receptor (OR) genes, lies internally on macaque chromosome 7. Sequence originating from this fission site is split between the terminus of 15q and the pericentromere of 14q in the great apes. Numerous structural rearrangements, including interstitial deletions and transfers of material to or from other subtelomeres, occurred subsequent to the fission, such that each species has a unique 15q structure and unique collection of ORs derived from the fission locus. The most striking rearrangement involved transfer of at least 200 kb from the fission-site region to the end of chromosome 4q, where much still resides in chimpanzee and gorilla, but not in human. This gross structural difference places the subtelomeric defect underlying facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy ( FSHD) much closer to the telomere in human 4q than in the hybrid 4q-15q subtelomere of chimpanzee."

The human MHC genomic region (called HLA) is extremely polymorphic comprising several thousand alleles, each encoding a distinct MHC molecule. The potentially unique specificity of the majority of HLA alleles that have been identified to date remains uncharacterized. Likewise, only a limited number of chimpanzee and rhesus macaque MHC class I molecules have been characterized experimentally. Here, we present NetMHCpan-2.0, a method that generates quantitative predictions of the affinity of any peptide-MHC class I interaction. NetMHCpan-2.0 has been trained on the hitherto largest set of quantitative MHC binding data available, covering HLA-A and HLA-B, as well as chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, gorilla, and mouse MHC class I molecules. We show that the NetMHCpan-2.0 method can accurately predict binding to uncharacterized HLA molecules, including HLA-C and HLA-G. Moreover, NetMHCpan-2.0 is demonstrated to accurately predict peptide binding to chimpanzee and macaque MHC class I molecules. The power of NetMHCpan-2.0 to guide immunologists in interpreting cellular immune responses in large out-bred populations is demonstrated. Further, we used NetMHCpan-2.0 to predict potential binding peptides for the pig MHC class I molecule SLA-1*0401. Ninety-three percent of the predicted peptides were demonstrated to bind stronger than 500 nM. The high performance of NetMHCpan-2.0 for non-human primates documents the method's ability to provide broad allelic coverage also beyond human MHC molecules.

Sequential list-learning by an adolescent lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) using an infrared touchframe apparatus,"['Ross, SR']",INTERACTION STUDIES,10.1075/is.10.2.02ros,2009,3,"The ability to appropriately sequence a list of discrete items is an important facet in performing routine cognitive tasks and may play a significant role in the acquisition of early communication skills. Though the serial learning abilities of some species, such as chimpanzees and rhesus macaques are well documented, there is virtually no information on the extent of these skills with gorillas. In this study, a young female western lowland gorilla has demonstrated the ability to learn a list of seven Arabic numerals by selecting them on a monitor behind an infrared touchframe. As list length increased (from three to seven), Rollie required fewer trials to reach the criterion, suggesting an acquisition of skills associated with serial learning. Rollie was most likely to correctly select the first item in the sequence and least likely to select the penultimate item in the sequence. Her performance suggests serial learning abilities in the range of other non-verbal species and provides preliminary evidence that supports the assertion that gorillas can succeed at this form of serial learning task."

Gorillas from two out of three European Zoos were positive for T. abrassarti, while gorillas from the Australian Zoo were negative. We documented a horizontal transmission of T. abrassarti to a non-infected adult gorilla introduced into a Troglodytella-positive group in the Prague Zoo and traced the origin of the ciliate infection to the Paignton Zoo (UK) using serial fecal examinations. During this study, two infant gorillas born in the Prague Zoo (CZ) first became positive for T. abrassarti at the age of 9 mo. Ciliate morphology and the sequencing of the small subunit rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer rDNA spacer region revealed that T. abrassarti affects both captive gorillas and chimpanzees. We conclude that zoo transport plays a major role in the distribution of T. abrassarti among captive gorillas."
How Ebola Impacts Genetics of Western Lowland Gorilla Populations,"['Le Gouar, PJ', 'Vallet, D', 'David, L', 'Bermejo, M', 'Gatti, S', 'Levrero, F', 'Petit, EJ', 'Menard, N']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0008375,DEC 18 2009,8,"Background: Emerging infectious diseases in wildlife are major threats for both human health and biodiversity conservation. Infectious diseases can have serious consequences for the genetic diversity of populations, which could enhance the species' extinction probability. The Ebola epizootic in western and central Africa induced more than 90% mortality in Western lowland gorilla population. Although mortality rates are very high, the impacts of Ebola on genetic diversity of Western lowland gorilla have never been assessed.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We carried out long term studies of three populations of Western lowland gorilla in the Republic of the Congo (Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Lossi gorilla sanctuary both affected by Ebola and Lossi's periphery not affected). Using 17 microsatellite loci, we compared genetic diversity and structure of the populations and estimate their effective size before and after Ebola outbreaks. Despite the effective size decline in both populations, we did not detect loss in genetic diversity after the epizootic. We revealed temporal changes in allele frequencies in the smallest population.

Conclusions/Significance: Immigration and short time elapsed since outbreaks could explain the conservation of genetic diversity after the demographic crash. Temporal changes in allele frequencies could not be explained by genetic drift or random sampling. Immigration from genetically differentiated populations and a non random mortality induced by Ebola, i.e., selective pressure and cost of sociality, are alternative hypotheses. Understanding the influence of Ebola on gorilla genetic dynamics is of paramount importance for human health, primate evolution and conservation biology."

"Gastrointestinal Bacterial Transmission among Humans, Mountain Gorillas, and Livestock in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda","['Rwego, IB', 'Isabirye-Basuta, G', 'Gillespie, TR', 'Goldberg, TL']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01018.x,DEC 2008,52,"Habitat overlap can increase the risks of anthroponotic and zoonotic pathogen transmission between humans, livestock, and wild apes. We collected Escherichia coli bacteria from humans, livestock, and mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, from May to August 2005 to examine whether habitat overlap influences rates and patterns of pathogen transmission between humans and apes and whether livestock might facilitate transmission. We genotyped 496 E. coli isolates with repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting and measured susceptibility to 11 antibiotics with the disc-diffusion method. We conducted population genetic analyses to examine genetic differences among populations of bacteria from different hosts and locations. Gorilla populations that overlapped in their use of habitat at high rates with people and livestock harbored E. coli that were genetically similar to E. coli from those people and livestock, whereas E. coli from gorillas that did not overlap in their use of habitats with people and livestock were more distantly related to human or livestock bacteria. Thirty-five percent of isolates from humans, 27% of isolates from livestock, and 17% of isolates from gorillas were clinically resistant to at least one antibiotic used by local people, and the proportion of individual gorillas harboring resistant isolates declined across populations in proportion to decreasing degrees of habitat overlap with humans. These patterns of genetic similarity and antibiotic resistance among E. coli from populations of apes, humans, and livestock indicate that habitat overlap between species affects the dynamics of gastrointestinal bacterial transmission, perhaps through domestic animal intermediates and the physical environment. Limiting such transmission would benefit human and domestic animal health and ape conservation."
Time and distribution: a model of ape biogeography,"['Lehmann, J', 'Korstjens, AH', 'Dunbar, RTM']",ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,NA,DEC 2008,15,"We use data from 20 chimpanzee, bonobo and gorilla study sites to develop an African great ape time budgets model to predict the animals' capacity to survive in a range of habitats across sub-Saharan Africa. The model uses body mass and climatic data to predict the time animals must allocate to key activities (feeding, moving, resting and social interaction), and then uses these to assess the limiting group size that could be sustained in a particular habitat. The model is robust against changes in minimum cut-off values, and predicts the current biogeographic distributions of the two African ape species remarkably well. Predicted group sizes for Parr and Gorilla are close to observed averages. The model also indicates that moving time plays a crucial role for both Pan and Gorilla site presence: i.e. at sites where they are absent it is primarily moving time that is increased as compared to other time budget variables. Finally, the model demonstrates that Pan and Gorilla distributions and group sizes can be accurately modelled by simply modifying the body mass variable, indicating that both share a similar underlying ecological bauplan."
Hominid mandibular corpus shape variation and its utility for recognizing species diversity within fossil Homo,"['Lague, MR', 'Collard, NJ', 'Richmond, BG', 'Wood, BA']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2008.00989.x,DEC 2008,11,"Mandibular corpora are well represented in the hominin fossil record, yet few studies have rigorously assessed the utility of mandibular corpus morphology for species recognition, particularly with respect to the linear dimensions that are most commonly available. In this study, we explored the extent to which commonly preserved mandibular corpus morphology can be used to: (i) discriminate among extant hominid taxa and (ii) support species designations among fossil specimens assigned to the genus Homo. In the first part of the study, discriminant analysis was used to test for significant differences in mandibular corpus shape at different taxonomic levels (genus, species and subspecies) among extant hominid taxa (i.e. Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo). In the second part of the study, we examined shape variation among fossil mandibles assigned to Homo (including H. habilis sensu stricto, H. rudolfensis, early African H. erectus/H. ergaster, late African H. erectus, Asian H. erectus, H. heidelbergensis, H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens). A novel randomization procedure designed for small samples (and using group 'distinctness values') was used to determine whether shape variation among the fossils is consistent with conventional taxonomy (or alternatively, whether a priori taxonomic groupings are completely random with respect to mandibular morphology). The randomization of 'distinctness values' was also used on the extant samples to assess the ability of the test to recognize known taxa. The discriminant analysis results demonstrated that, even for a relatively modest set of traditional mandibular corpus measurements, we can detect significant differences among extant hominids at the genus and species levels, and, in some cases, also at the subspecies level. Although the randomization of 'distinctness values' test is more conservative than discriminant analysis (based on comparisons with extant specimens), we were able to detect at least four distinct groups among the fossil specimens (i.e. H. sapiens, H. heidelbergensis, Asian H. erectus and a combined 'African Homo' group consisting of H. habilis sensu stricto, H. rudolfensis, early African H. erectus/H. ergaster and late African H. erectus). These four groups appear to be distinct at a level similar to, or greater than, that of modern hominid species. In addition, the mandibular corpora of H. neanderthalensis could be distinguished from those of 'African Homo', although not from those of H. sapiens, H. heidelbergensis, or the Asian H. erectus group. The results suggest that the features most commonly preserved on the hominin mandibular corpus have some taxonomic utility, although they are unlikely to be useful in generating a reliable alpha taxonomy for early African members of the genus Homo."
Evolutionary modifications of human milk composition: evidence from long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid composition of anthropoid milks,"['Milligan, LA', 'Bazinet, RP']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.07.010,DEC 2008,21,"Brain growth in mammals is associated with increased accretion of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) in brain phospholipids. The period of maximum accumulation is during the brain growth spurt. Humans have a perinatal brain growth spurt, selectively accumulating docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and other LCPUFA from the third trimester through the second year of life. The emphasis on rapid postnatal brain growth and LCPUFA transfer during lactation has led to the suggestion that human milk LCPUFA composition may be unique. Our study tests this hypothesis by determining fatty acid composition for 11 species of captive anthropoids (n = 53; Callithrix jacchus, Cebus apella, Gorilla gorilla, Hylobates lar, Leontopithecus rosalia, Macaca mulatta, Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Pongo pygmaeus, Saimiri boliviensis, and Symphalangus syndactylus). Results are compared to previously published data on five species of wild anthropoids (n = 28; Alouatta paliatta, Callithrix jacchus, Gorilla beringei, Leontopithecus rosalia, and Macaca sinica) and human milk fatty acid profiles. Milk LCPUFA profiles of captive anthropoids (consuming diets with a preformed source of DHA) are similar to milk from women on a Western diet, and those of wild anthropoids are similar to milk from vegan women. Collectively, the range of DHA percent composition values from nonhuman anthropoid milks (0.03-1.1) is nearly identical to that from a cross-cultural analysis of human milk (0.06-1.4). Humans do not appear to be unique in their ability to secrete LCPUFA in milk but may be unique in their access to dietary LCPUFA. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Fatal ulcerative colitis in a western lowland gorilla (gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Lankester, F', 'Matz-Rensing, K', 'Kiyang, J', 'Jensen, SA', 'Weiss, S', 'Leendertz, FH']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1111/j.1600-0684.2008.00287.x,DEC 2008,10,"A captive western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) presented with watery diarrhoea that progressed to become profuse and haemorrhagic. Faecal analyses revealed Balantidium (B.) coli trophozoites and salmonella-like bacteria. Despite treatment the gorilla died on the 5th day after onset of symptoms. Post-mortem examination revealed a severe erosive-ulcerative superficial and deep colitis. Histological examination of post-mortem samples of the colon showed plentiful B. coli invading into the mucosa and submucosa, whilst PCR screening of bacterial DNA could not confirm any bacteria species which could be connected to the clinical picture. As B. coli is usually a non-pathogenic gut commensal, and as this animal previously showed evidence of non-symptomatic infection of B. coli, it is possible that the switch in pathogenicity was triggered by an acute bacterial infection. Despite successful treatment of the bacterial infection the secondary deep invasion of B. coli was not reversed, possibly because of the failure of the treatment regimen, and led to the death of the gorilla."
Females Shape the Genetic Structure of a Gorilla Population,"['Guschanski, K', 'Caillaud, D', 'Robbins, MM', 'Vigilant, L']",CURRENT BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cub.2008.10.031,NOV 25 2008,18,"Dispersal, one of the key life-history features of a species, influences gene flow and, consequently, the genetic structuring of populations. Landscape characteristics such as rivers, mountains, or habitat fragmentation affect dispersal and result in broad-scale genetic structuring of various mammalian species [1-5]. However, less attention has been paid to studying how dispersal is influenced by finer-scale microgeographic variation in a continuous habitat. Here we investigate the genetic structure of a closed population of similar to 300 endangered mountain gorillas living in multiple groups in a small (331 km(2)) forest in southwestern Uganda. In a species in which both sexes routinely disperse, population genetic structure in females was influenced by distance, altitude, and plant community composition, whereas males were not geographically structured. The effect of distance fits the observed tendency of females to transfer to neighboring groups, whereas the effects of altitude and vegetation reflect the changing species composition of locally available food resources. These results suggest that individual dietary preferences are important even in a highly mobile species living amid abundant food, and we propose that preference for natal habitats will influence dispersal decisions in many other vertebrate taxa."

The authors show here that most of those criticisms are not valid because: (i) most threats to internal validity (e.g., conspecific experimenters for humans but not apes) are controlled for experimentally; (ii) externally, there is no empirical evidence that captive apes have fewer cognitive skills than wild apes and indeed some evidence (especially from human-raised apes) that they have more; and (iii) externally, there is no empirical evidence that Western middle-class children have different cognitive skills from other children at very early ages in basic cognitive domains. Although difficult, with appropriate methodological care, experimental cross-species comparisons may be validly made."
Food preferences of wild mountain gorillas,"['Ganas, J', 'Ortmann, S', 'Robbins, MM']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20584,OCT 2008,14,"Determining the nutritional and phenolic basis of food preference is important for understanding the nutritional requirements of animals. Preference is a measure of which foods would be consumed by an animal if there was no variation in availability among food items. From September 2004 to August 2005, we measured the food preferences of four wild mountain gorilla groups that consume foliage and fruit in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, to determine what nutrients and phenols are preferred and/or avoided. To do so, we asked the following questions: (1) Which plant species do the gorillas prefer? (2) Considering the different plant parts consumed of these preferred species, what nutrients and/or phenols characterize them? (3) Do the nutritional and phenolic characteristics of preferred foods differ among gorilla groups? We found that although some species were preferred and others were not, of those species found in common among the different group home ranges, the same ones were generally preferred by all groups. Second, all groups preferred leaves with relatively high protein content and relatively low fiber content. Third, three out of four groups preferred leaves with relatively high sugar amounts. Fourth, all groups preferred pith with relatively high sugar content. Finally, of the two groups tested, we found that the preferred fruits of one group had relatively high condensed tannin and fiber/sugar contents, whereas the other group's preferred fruits were not characterized by any particular nutrient/phenol. Overall, there were no differences among gorilla groups in nutritional and phenolic preferences. Our results indicate that protein and sugar are important in the diets of gorillas, and that the gorillas fulfil these nutritional requirements through a combination of different plant parts, shedding new light on how gorillas balance their diets in a variable environment."
Peaceful post-conflict interactions between aggressors and bystanders in captive lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Palagi, E', 'Chiarugi, E', 'Cordoni, G']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20587,OCT 2008,12,"We observed a colony of lowland gorillas in order to assess the occurrence of Peaceful Post-Conflict Interactions between Aggressors and Bystanders (PPIAB). We compared the dynamics of PPIAB with those of Peaceful Post-Conflict Interactions between Victims and Bystanders (PPIVB), which are directed toward victims. We confirmed the occurrence of PPIAB (mean Triadic Contact Tendency: 41.7%+/- 16.2% SEM) at frequencies comparable to PPIVB. Immature gorillas were responsible for most PPIAB. PPIAB occurred when the bystander was unrelated to either the aggressor or the victim, and when it was a relative of the aggressor. However, affinitive contact rates were higher in the former case. Unlike PPIVB, PPIAB significantly reduced the likelihood of further aggressions within the group, suggesting that they work at an immediate level. Our data also suggest that bystanders decide when a peaceful contact may be too risky; in fact, neither PPIAB nor PPIVB occurred after high-intensity aggressions."
Do animals live in the present? Current evidence and implications for welfare,"['Mendl, M', 'Paul, ES', 'POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER']",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,10.1016/j.applanim.2008.01.013,OCT 2008,11,"The importance of understanding the mental experiences of animals in order to assess their welfare was recognised by the 1965 UK Brambell Committee Report. The report further suggested that the extent to which animals live life in the present moment has a major impact on their capacity for suffering. Limited ability to recall previous events and imagine future ones would protect animals From the worry, 'rumination' and associated emotional disorders that contribute so much to human suffering. We investigate these suggestions in the light of new evidence on the capacity of animals to travel mentally through time, and with reference to the subjective experiences of human amnesic patients who are indeed 'stuck in time', living their lives in the present. The key human abilities for mental time travel are episodic memory and episodic future thinking, characterised by an ability to place events in time (what, where, when (www)), and to consciously recall or imagine these events. Tests of www memory, recollection vs. familiarity memory, single-trial learning, episodic vs. semantic encoding, and forward planning have been used to investigate whether such cognitive systems also exist in animals. The evidence indicates that some studied species show behaviour consistent with the capacity for mental time travel, while others do not. The extent to which animals consciously experience mental time travel remains unknown. In terms of the implications for welfare, research on human amnesics with damage to brain structures involved in episodic memory suggests that animals lacking mental time travel would miss the beneficial consequences of using previous experience to plan and organise future behaviour, but also the detrimental consequences of being able to ruminate on the recalled past and worry about the imagined future. Emotional responses, including future-directed anxiety would be temporally bound by the presence of relevant stimuli or cues and, therefore, potentially short-lived. However past experiences could, through the actions of non-episodic memory systems attributable to other brain structures, still impact on emotional state via (implicit) learning of associations between cues and emotional events. Cumulative effects of past experience on stress response mechanisms and baseline stress or mood states would also be expected to occur. Mental time travel may thus bring both welfare benefits and problems. Absence of this ability by no means releases animals from many effects of the environment, including the past, on their emotional state. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Ranging of Rhinopithecus bieti in the Samage Forest, China. I. Characteristics of Range Use","['Grueter, CC', 'Li, DY', 'van Schaik, CP', 'Ren, BP', 'Long, YC', 'Wei, FW']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-008-9299-9,OCT 2008,19,"We quantified the home range and explored the style of ranging of black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) in the subtropical-temperate montane Samage Forest (part of Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve) in the vicinity of Gehuaqing. Over 14.5 mo, we took positional records of the study band via a GPS receiver at 30-min intervals, and found that they covered an area of 32 km(2). Over a 10-yr period, the group even ranged in an area of 56 km(2), which is among the largest home range estimates for any primate. The large home range was probably due to the combined effects of large group size (N > 400) and forest heterogeneity, with seasonally food-rich areas interspersed with less valuable areas. The subjects did not use their home range uniformly: 29% of the grid cells had more location records than expected based on a uniform distribution, thus representing a core area, albeit a disjunct one. A continuous 1-mo group follow in the fall revealed that the band traveled on average 1.62 km/d and that days of concentrated use of a particular forest block were followed by more extensive marches. Neither climate nor human disturbance parameters correlate significantly with monthly estimates of the group's home range size. Even though there is no significant correlation between temporal availability of plant phenophases and range size, our observations implicate temporal and spatial availability of food as a determinant of home range use of the focal group. Winter, spring, and summer home ranges are equally large: 18.2, 17.8, and 18.6 km(2), respectively. Home range decreased markedly in fall (9.3 km(2)), probably because the band obtained sufficient food resources (fruit) in a smaller area. The large winter range is best attributed to the exploitation of dispersed clumped patches of mature fruits."

","['Chung, WK', 'Steiper, ME']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-008-9303-4,OCT 2008,8,"Numts are nonfunctional mitochondrial sequences that have translocated into nuclear DNA, where they evolve independently from the original mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence. Numts can be unintentionally amplified in addition to authentic mtDNA, complicating both the analysis and interpretation of mtDNA-based studies. Amplification of numts creates particular issues for studies on the noncoding, hypervariable 1 mtDNA region of gorillas. We provide data on putative numt sequences of the coding mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII). Via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloning, we obtained COII sequences for gorilla, orangutan, and human high-quality DNA and also from a gorilla fecal DNA sample. Both gorilla and orangutan samples yielded putative numt sequences. Phylogenetically more anciently transferred numts were amplified with a greater incidence from the gorilla fecal DNA sample than from the high-quality gorilla sample. Data on phylogenetically more recently transferred numts are equivocal. We further demonstrate the need for additional investigations into the use of mtDNA markers for noninvasively collected samples from gorillas and other primates."
A quantitative method for the evaluation of three-dimensional structure of temporal bone pneumatization,"['Hill, CA', 'Richtsmeier, JT']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.03.010,OCT 2008,10,"Temporal bone pneumatization has been included in lists of characters used in phylogenetic analyses of human evolution. While studies suggest that the extent of pneumatization has decreased over the course of human evolution, little is known about the processes underlying these changes or their significance. In short, reasons for the observed reduction and the potential reorganization within pneumatized spaces are unknown. Technological limitations have limited previous analyses of pneumatization in extant and fossil species to qualitative observations of the extent of temporal bone pneumatization. In this paper, we introduce a novel application of quantitative methods developed for the Study of trabecular bone to the analysis of pneumatized spaces of the temporal bone. This method utilizes high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (HRXCT) images and quantitative software to estimate three-dimensional parameters (bone Volume fractions, anisotropy, and trabecular thickness) of bone Structure within defined units of pneumatized spaces. We apply this approach in an analysis of temporal bones of diverse but related primate species, Got-ilia gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Homo sapiens, and Papio hamadryas anubis, to illustrate the potential of these methods. In demonstrating the utility of these methods, we show that there are interspecific differences in the bone Structure of pneumatized spaces, perhaps reflecting changes in the localized growth dynamics, location of muscle attachments, encephalization, or basicranial flexion.

Subdivision in an ancestral species creates asymmetry in gene trees,"['Slatkin, M', 'Pollack, JL']",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1093/molbev/msn172,OCT 2008,26,"We consider gene trees in three species for which the species tree is known. We show that population subdivision in ancestral species can lead to asymmetry in the frequencies of the two gene trees not concordant with the species tree and, if subdivision is extreme, cause the one of the nonconcordant gene trees to be more probable than the concordant gene tree. Although published data for the human-chimp-gorilla clade and for three species of Drosophila show asymmetry consistent with our model, sequencing error could also account for observed patterns. We show that substantial levels of persistent ancestral subdivision are needed to account for the observed levels of asymmetry found in these two studies."

Frequently splitting and merging in subgroups of variable composition (fission-fusion or FF dynamics) has been proposed as one aspect of social complexity ([2, 6-9]; compare with [10]) that may be associated with an enhancement of cognitive skills like inhibition [111], which allows the suppression of prepotent but ineffective responses in a changing social environment [7]. We compared the performance of primates experiencing high levels of FF dynamics (chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and spider monkeys) to that of species living in more cohesive groups (gorillas, capuchin monkeys, and long-tailed macaques) [12-13] on five inhibition tasks. Testing species differing in diet, phylogenetic relatedness, and levels of FF dynamics allowed us to contrast ecological, phylogenetic, and socioecological explanations for interspecific differences. Spider monkeys performed at levels comparable to chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans, and better than gorillas. A two-cluster analysis grouped all species with higher levels of FF dynamics together. These findings confirmed that enhanced inhibitory skills are positively associated with FF dynamics, more than to phylogenetic relations or feeding ecology."
"Effects of habitat fragmentation, population size and demographic history on genetic diversity: The Cross River gorilla in a comparative context","['Bergl, RA', 'Bradleys, BJ', 'Nsubuga, A', 'Vigilant, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20559,SEP 2008,32,"In small and fragmented populations, genetic diversity may be reduced owing to increased levels of drift and inbreeding. This reduced diversity is often associated with decreased fitness and a higher threat of extinction. However, it is difficult to determine when a population has low diversity except in a comparative context. We assessed genetic variability in the critically endangered Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli), a small and fragmented population, using 11 autosomal microsatellite loci. We show that levels of diversity in the Cross River population are not evenly distributed across the three genetically identified subpopulations, and that one centrally located subpopulation has higher levels of variability than the others. All measures of genetic variability in the Cross River population were comparable to those of the similarly small mountain gorilla (G. beringel beringel) populations (Bwindi and Virunga). However, for some measures both the Cross River and mountain gorilla populations show lower levels of diversity than a sample from a large, continuous western gorilla population (Mondika, G. gorilla gorilla). Finally, we tested for the genetic signature of a bottleneck in each of the four populations. Only Cross River showed strong evidence of a reduction in population size, suggesting that the reduction in size of this population was more recent or abrupt than in the two mountain gorilla populations. These results emphasize the need for maintaining connectivity in fragmented populations and highlight the importance of allowing small populations to expand."
Prolactin levels in Western Lowland gorillas,"['Laughlin, S', 'Meehan, T', 'Zinaman, MJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20572,SEP 2008,0,"Hyperprolactinemia is known to cause menstrual irregularity and infertility in humans. However, little is known about the role of prolactin in menstruation and fertility in Western Lowland gorillas. To create a database of prolactin values in gorillas, we have performed immunoassays on serum specimens dating back to 1983 from nine female gorillas at the Brookfield Zoo. We matched these samples with documented behavioral data to correlate menstrual timing. In addition, we ran other reproductive hormones both to aid in determining the phase of the menstrual cycle and to evaluate the effect of the prolactin on suppression of these hormones during the premenarchal and postpartum phases. We found that values for luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol and progesterone cycle in very similar patterns to humans. Based on the 59 available samples, prolactin was found to be higher in gorillas than in humans in nearly every phase of the menstrual cycle (range 49.9-93.7 ng/mL) and such levels do not appear to alter the reproductive axis as it does in humans. Thus, prolactin may have a different impact on fertility in gorillas than it does in humans."

Tracking the rotational displacements of containers and hidden objects is a particularly challenging task. This study investigated the ability of 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-year-old children and great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) to (a) visually track rotational displacements of a baited container on a platform and (b) infer its displacements by using the changes of position or orientation of 3 landmarks: an object on a container, the color of the containers, and the color of the platform on which the containers rested. Great apes and 5-year-old and older children successfully tracked visible rotations, but only children were able to infer the location of a correct cup (with the help of landmarks) after invisible rotations. The ability to use landmarks changed with age so that younger children solved this task only with the most explicit marker on the baited container, whereas older children, particularly 9-year-olds, were able to use landmark orientation to infer correct locations."

We analyzed the minicolumnar organization of cells in layer III of Broca's area in 11 human and 9 great ape specimens. A semiautomated method was used to analyze digitized images of histological sections stained for Nissl substance. Horizontal spacing distance and gray level index (GLI; or the area fraction occupied by cells) were quantified in all images. In contrast to area Tpt, the only cortical area for which comparative minicolumnar data have been published previously for humans and one of the great apes, we found no population-level asymmetry, for either horizontal spacing distance or GLI. Only human females exhibited a leftward asymmetry in GLI. GLI was lower in humans than in great apes (P < 0.001), allowing more space for connectivity in layer III. In humans, horizontal spacing distance was greater than in great apes but smaller relative to brain size."

However, the precise relationship between suture closure and phylogenetic affinities is poorly understood. In this study, we used Guttman Scaling to determine if the modal progression of suture closure differs among Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Gorilla gorilla. Because DNA sequence homologies strongly suggest that R troglodytes and Homo sapiens share a more recent common ancestor than either does with G. gorilla, we hypothesized that this phylogenetic relationship would be reflected in the suture closure patterns of these three taxa. Results indicated that while all three species do share a similar lateral-anterior closure pattern, G. gorilla exhibits a unique vault pattern, which, unlike humans and R troglodytes, follows a strong posterior-to-anterior gradient.

A comparison of female mating strategies in Pan troglodytes and Pongo spp.,"['Stumpf, RM', 'Thompson, ME', 'Knott, CD']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s10764-008-9284-3,AUG 2008,13,"Orangutans and chimpanzees differ in many aspects of their mating and social systems. Nevertheless, because both great apes require enormous maternal investment in offspring and because female reproductive potential is limited, female orangutans and chimpanzees should be selective of their mates, yet expected to exhibit anti-infanticide strategies such as mating with multiple males. We review and compare mating patterns in orangutans and chimpanzees to understand how these critical pressures are filtered through the different demands of the socioecology of each species. We highlight the variation in female mating behavior as a function of the proximity of ovulation. We conclude that both genera pursue tactics for paternity confusion by mating with multiple males and by mating cooperatively or even proceptively with nonpreferred partners when conception is unlikely. Mating selectivity is suggested by variation in proceptive behavior toward particular partners and by increased resistance of nonpreferred partners during the periovulatory period. Thus, data for both species support a mixed mating strategy whereby females shift their mating behavior in accordance with ovulatory status to accommodate the competing demands of mate selectivity and paternity confusion."
Clinical and pathologic manifestation of oesophagostomosis in African great apes: does self-medication in wild apes influence disease progression?,"['Krief, S', 'Jamart, A', 'Mahe, S', 'Leendertz, FH', 'Matz-Rensing, K', 'Crespeau, F', 'Bain, O', 'Guillot, J']",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY,10.1111/j.1600-0684.2008.00285.x,AUG 2008,24,"Nodular worms (Oesophagostomum spp.) are common intestinal parasites found in cattle, pig, and primates including humans. In human, they are responsible for serious clinical disease called oesophagostomosis resulting from the formation of granulomas, caseous lesions or abscesses in intestinal walls. In wild great apes, the fecal prevalence of this parasite is high, but little information is available concerning the clinical signs and lesions associated. In the present study, we describe six cases of multinodular oesophagostomosis in free-ranging and ex-captive chimpanzees and captive gorillas caused by Oesophagostomum stephanostomum. While severe clinical signs associated with this infection were observed in great apes raised in sanctuaries, nodules found in wild chimpanzees do not seem to affect their health status. One hypothesis to explain this difference would be that in wild chimpanzees, access to natural environment and behavior such as rough leaves swallowing combined with ingestion of plants having pharmacological properties would prevent severe infection and decrease potential symptoms."
"Personality assessment in the Great Apes: Comparing ecologically valid behavior measures, behavior ratings, and adjective ratings","['Uher, J', 'Asendorpf, JB']",JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PERSONALITY,10.1016/j.jrp.2007.10.004,AUG 2008,50,"Three methods of personality assessment (behavior measures, behavior ratings, adjective ratings) were compared in 20 zoo-housed Great Apes: bonobos (Pan paniscus), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus abelii). To test a new bottom-up approach, the studied trait constructs were systematically generated from the species' behavioral repertoires. The assessments were reliable, temporally stable, and showed substantial cross-method coherence. In most traits, behavior ratings mediated the relations between adjective ratings and behavior measures. Results suggest that high predictability of manifest behavior is best achieved by behavior ratings, not by adjectives. Empirical evidence for trait constructs beyond current personality models points to the necessity of broad and systematic approaches for valid inferences on a species' personality structure.

Genetic identification of elusive animals: re-evaluating tracking and nesting data for wild western gorillas,"['Bradley, BJ', 'Doran-Sheehy, DM', 'Vigilant, L']",JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,10.1111/j.1469-7998.2008.00431.x,AUG 2008,11,"Western gorillas Gorilla gorilla have been exceedingly difficult to habituate to the presence of human observers. Nevertheless, researchers have amassed a wealth of information on population densities and group structure for this ape species by locating and counting the sleeping nests of wild individuals. Such nest-count studies have suggested that western gorilla groups often have multiple silverbacks and these multimale groups occasionally divide into smaller subgroups. However, observational data from forest clearing sites and from a few recently habituated western gorilla groups show no evidence of multimale family groups or of subgrouping. This discrepancy underscores a long-standing question in ape research: How accurately do nesting sites reflect true group compositions? We evaluated these indirect measures of group composition by using DNA from faeces and hair to genetically identify individual gorillas at nesting sites. Samples were collected from unhabituated wild western gorillas ranging near Mondika Research Center in the Central African Republic and Republic of Congo. DNA extracted from these samples was genotyped at up to 10 microsatellite loci and one X-Y homologous locus for sex identification. Individuals were then identified at nesting sites by their unique multilocus genotypes, thus providing a 'molecular census' of individual gorillas. Results confirm that western gorillas often build more than one nest at a nesting site and, thus, nest counts can be highly inaccurate indicators of group size and composition. Indeed, we found that nest counts can overestimate group size by as much as 40%, indicating that true gorilla population numbers are probably lower than those reported from census surveys. This study demonstrates how genetic analysis can be a valuable tool for studying and conserving elusive, endangered animals."

The objectives of the study were to collect baseline data in order to document the helminth parasites infecting this group of gorillas and to examine the effects of season and host age-sex class on patterns of parasite infection. In addition to weekly surveys of feces from all group members, fecal samples from 4 identified individuals were examined almost daily. We identified the diagnostic stages of the following parasites: strongylids (Strongylida), Anoplocephala gorillae, Probstmayria sp., Strongyloides fuelleborni, and a trematode. Monthly and daily fluctuations in strongylid egg counts were observed. Infants had lower strongylid egg counts compared with other group members. Both of the silverbacks had higher mean egg counts in the wet season than in the dry season. Examination of fecal samples from identifiable gorillas revealed high day-today variation in strongylid egg counts. No evidence of anthropozoonotic transmission of intestinal helminths was found."

Fiber-bound nitrogen in gorilla diets: Implications for estimating dietary protein intake of primates,"['Rothman, JM', 'Chapman, CA', 'Pell, AN']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,10.1002/ajp.20540,JUL 2008,23,"Protein is essential for living organisms, but digestibility of crude protein is poorly understood and difficult to predict. Nitrogen is used to estimate protein content because nitrogen is a component of the amino acids that comprise protein, but a substantial portion of the nitrogen in plants may be bound to fiber in an indigestible form. To estimate the amount of crude protein that is unavailable in the diets of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, foods routinely eaten were analyzed to determine the amount of nitrogen bound to the acid-detergent fiber residue. The amount of fiber-bound nitrogen varied among plant parts: herbaceous leaves 14.5 +/- 8.9% (reported as a percentage of crude protein on a dry matter (DM) basis), tree leaves (16.1 +/- 6.7% DM), pith/ herbaceous peel (26.2 +/- 8.9% DM), fruit (34.7 +/- 17.8% DM), bark (43.8 +/- 15.6% DM), and decaying wood (85.2 +/- 14.6% DM). When crude protein and available protein intake of adult gorillas was estimated over a year, 15.1% of the dietary crude protein was indigestible. These results indicate that the proportion of fiber-bound protein in primate diets should be considered when estimating protein intake, food selection, and food/habitat quality."
"Tubes, tables and traps: great apes solve two functionally equivalent trap tasks but show no evidence of transfer across tasks","['Martin-Ordas, G', 'Call, J', 'Colmenares, F']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-007-0132-1,JUL 2008,41,"Previous studies on tool using have shown that presenting subjects with certain modifications in the experimental setup can substantially improve their performance. However, procedural modifications (e.g. trap table task) may not only remove task constraints but also simplify the problem conceptually. The goal of this study was to design a variation of the trap-table that was functionally equivalent to the trap-tube task. In this new task, the subjects had to decide where to insert the tool and in which direction the reward should be pushed. We also administered a trap-tube task that allowed animals to push or rake the reward with the tool to compare the subjects' performance on both tasks. We used a larger sample of subjects than in previous studies and from all the four species of great apes (Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, and Pongo pygmaeus). The results showed that apes performed better in the trap-platform task than in the trap-tube task. Subjects solved the tube task faster than in previous studies and they also preferred to rake in rather than to push the reward out. There was no correlation in the level of performance between both tasks, and no indication of interspecies differences. These data are consistent with the idea that apes may possess some specific causal knowledge of traps but may lack the ability to establish analogical relations between functional equivalent tasks."
"Behavioural responses to photographs by pictorially naive baboons (Papio anubis), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)","['Parron, C', 'Call, J', 'Fagot, J']",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,10.1016/j.beproc.2008.01.019,JUL 2008,19,"This study assessed how pictorially naive nonhuman primates understand pictures. Fifty-five baboons with no prior exposure to pictures were trained to grasp a slice of banana presented against a pebble in a two alternative forced choice task. Post-training testing involved three stimulus pairs: (1) real banana slice vs. its picture, (2) the banana picture vs. a real pebble and (3) banana picture vs. a pebble picture which were presented twice. Preliminary data were also collected on naive gorillas (n = 4) and chimpanzees (n = 7) using the same procedure. Baboons revealed a preference for the food picture in (2) and (3) and often ate this stimulus, but the food item and its picture were accurately discriminated in (1). These results suggest that baboons mistook the pictorial stimulus and its referent, but processed the banana pictures as poor exemplars of the real banana category. Among apes, only gorillas ate the banana pictures, suggesting that picture-object confusion may also occur in this species. Findings are discussed as pertaining to the general issue of representational abilities in nonhuman primates, and its evolution. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We developed a spatially explicit simulation model to investigate whether-and under what conditions-disease-related mortality can impact rates of pathogen spread in populations of polygynous groups. Specifically, we investigated whether pathogen-mediated dispersal (PMD) can occur when females disperse after the resident male dies from disease, thus carrying infections to new groups. We also examined the effects of incubation period and virulence, host mortality and rates of background dispersal, and we used the model to investigate the spread of the virus responsible for Ebola hemorrhagic fever, which currently is devastating African ape populations. Output was analyzed using regression trees, which enable exploration of hierarchical and non-linear relationships. Analyses revealed that the incidence of disease in single-male (polygynous) groups was significantly greater for those groups containing an average of more than six females, while the total number of infected hosts in the population was most sensitive to the number of females per group. Thus, as expected, PMD occurs in polygynous groups and its effects increase as harem size (the number of females) increases. Simulation output further indicated that population-level effects of Ebola are likely to differ among multi-male-multi-female chimpanzees and polygynous gorillas, with larger overall numbers of chimpanzees infected, but more gorilla groups becoming infected due to increased dispersal when the resident male dies. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of social system on the spread of disease in wild mammals."

Evolutionary dynamics of segmental duplications from human Y-chromosomal euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions,"['Kirsch, S', 'Munch, C', 'Jiang, ZS', 'Cheng, Z', 'Chen, L', 'Batz, C', 'Eichler, EE', 'Schempp, W']",GENOME RESEARCH,10.1101/gr.076711.108,JUL 2008,21,"Human chromosomal regions enriched in segmental duplications are subject to extensive genomic reorganization. Such regions are particularly informative for illuminating the evolutionary history of a given chromosome. We have analyzed 866 kb of Y-chromosomal non-palindromic segmental duplications delineating four euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions (Yp11.2/Yp11.1, Yq11.1/Yq11.21, Yq11.23/Yq12, and Yq12/PAR2). Several computational methods were applied to decipher the segmental duplication architecture and identify the ancestral origin of the 41 different duplicons. Combining computational and comparative FISH analysis, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of these regions. Our analysis indicates a continuous process of transposition of duplicated sequences onto the evolving higher primate Y chromosome, providing unique insights into the development of species-specific Y-chromosomal and autosomal duplicons. Phylogenetic sequence comparisons show that duplicons of the human Yp11.2/Yp11.1 region were already present in the macaque-human ancestor as multiple paralogs located predominantly in subtelomeric regions. In contrast, duplicons from the Yq11.1/Yq11.21, Yq11.23/Yq12, and Yq12/PAR2 regions show no evidence of duplication in rhesus macaque, but map to the pericentromeric regions in chimpanzee and human. This suggests an evolutionary shift in the direction of duplicative transposition events from subtelomeric in Old World monkeys to pericentromeric in the human/ape lineage. Extensive chromosomal relocation of autosomal-duplicated sequences from euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions to interstitial regions as demonstrated on the pygmy chimpanzee Y chromosome support a model in which substantial reorganization and amplification of duplicated sequences may contribute to speciation."

Although both species exhibit a categorical preference for ripe fruit over other food objects, the thick enamel and crenulated occlusal surface of Pongo molar teeth predict a diet that is more resistant to deformation (hard) and fracture (tough) than the diet of Pan. We confirm these predictions with behavioral observations of Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii and Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii in the wild and describe the mechanical properties of foods utilized during periods when preferred foods are scarce. Such fallback foods may have exerted a selective pressure on tooth evolution. particularly molar enamel thinness, which is interpreted as a functional adaptation to seasonal folivory and a derived character trait within the hominoid clade. The thick enamel and crenulated occlusal surface of Pongo molars is interpreted as a functional adaptation to the routine consumption of relatively tough and hard foods. We discuss the implications of these interpretations for inferring the diet of hominin species, which possessed varying degrees of thick molar enamel. These data, which are among the first reported for hominoid primates. fill an important empirical void for evaluating the mechanical plausibility of putative hominin food objects.

Monitoring population decline: can transect surveys detect the impact of the Ebola virus on apes?,"['Devos, C', 'Walsh, PD', 'Arnhem, E', 'Huynen, MC']",ORYX,10.1017/S0030605308000161,JUL 2008,3,"In 2004 the Ebola virus caused a drastic decline in western gorilla Gorilla gorilla abundance at Lokoue Bai, a clearing in Odzala National Park, Republic of Congo. This decline was detected by observations of gorillas visiting the clearing. We confirm that the sympatric chimpanzee Pan troglodytes Population was also affected by the Ebola Outbreak, and test whether the decline in the ape population would have been detected with line-transect survevs, the most commonly used wildlife monitoring methodology in Central Africa. We also evaluate the potential of transect surveys for describing the extent and pinpointing the timing of drastic population declines when this information is not known from other evidence. Both nest survey using the marked nest count method and standing stock survey of other signs of ape presence (dung, feeding remains, prints) were able to detect the decline. However, only nests and dung were reliable indices for estimating the magnitude of the decline and accurately pinpointing the timing. It was necessary to pool data across many survey replicates because of small samples sizes. Our results suggest that transects methods are able to detect drastic changes in ape abundance but that large sample sizes are necessary to achieve adequate statistical power. We therefore recommend that those intending to use transect methods as tools for monitoring large forest mammals evaluate in advance how much effort will be necessary to detect meaningful changes in animal abundance."

Byrne [e.g. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B, Biological Sciences 358:529-536, 2003] has claimed that individuals acquire these skills by means of the so-called program-level imitation, in which the overall sequence of problem-solving steps (not the precise actions) is reproduced. In this study we present western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) with highly similar nettles. Twelve gorillas in three different groups (including also one nettle-naive gorilla) used the same program-level technique as wild mountain gorillas (with differences mainly on the action level). Chimpanzees, orangutans, and bonobos did not show these program-level patterns, nor did the gorillas when presented with a plant similar in structural design but lacking stinging defenses. We conclude that although certain aspects (i.e. single actions) of this complex skill may be owing to social learning, at the program level gorilla nettle feeding derives mostly from genetic predispositions and individual learning of plant affordances."
The evolution of teaching,"['Thornton, A', 'Raihani, NJ']",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.12.014,JUN 2008,65,"Teaching has long been a neglected area in animal behaviour, despite its relevance for a wide range of topics. In light of recent evidence for teaching in nonhuman animals, research can begin to examine the conditions under which it may evolve. Here, we make the case for an evolutionary perspective that treats teaching as a form of cooperative behaviour which functions to promote learning in others. We outline its key characteristics and discuss the selection pressures that may favour its evolution. Teaching will be favoured by selection only where the costs to teachers of facilitating learning are outweighed by the long-term fitness benefits they accrue once pupils have learned, and these benefits will be scaled by the ease with which pupils could learn without teaching. This perspective allows us to make predictions as to the distribution of teaching, the forms it may take, and the relation between teaching in humans and other species. We conclude by considering how teaching may best be categorized. We suggest that natural selection is likely to favour different forms of teaching, depending on whether it serves to promote learning of procedural or declarative information.

Chromosomes were prepared by lymphocyte cells culture at 37 degrees C for 72h then stained by G banding technique. The result indicated that diploid (2n) of siamang was 51 (one irregular chromosome was found). The autosome consists of 47 metacentric and submetacentric, 2 telocentric chromosomes. The X chromosome was metacentric chromosome. The increasing of one metacentric chromosome 22 lead to the presence of the irregular chromosome and the changing of 2n=50 to 2n=51. The augmentation of chromosome 22 was found in all metaphase cells of the entire study. We suggested that the chromosome increasing is a consequence from the non-disjunction in meiosis cell division."
Replication-timing-correlated spatial chromatin arrangements in cancer and in primate interphase nuclei,"['Grasser, F', 'Neusser, M', 'Fiegler, H', 'Thormeyer, T', 'Cremer, M', 'Carter, NP', 'Cremer, T', 'Muller, S']",JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE,10.1242/jcs.026989,JUN 1 2008,30,"Using published high-resolution data on S-phase replication timing, we determined the three-dimensional (3D) nuclear arrangement of 33 very-early-replicating and 31 very-late-replicating loci. We analyzed diploid human, non-human primate and rearranged tumor cells by 3D fluorescence in situ hybridization with the aim of investigating the impact of chromosomal structural changes on the nuclear organization of these loci. Overall, their topology was found to be largely conserved between cell types, species and in tumor cells. Early-replicating loci were localized in the nuclear interior, whereas late-replicating loci showed a broader distribution with a higher preference for the periphery than for late-BrdU-incorporation foci. However, differences in the spatial arrangement of early and late loci of chromosome 2, as compared with those from chromosome 5, 7 and 17, argue against replication timing as a major driving force for the 3D radial genome organization in human lymphoblastoid cell nuclei. Instead, genomic properties, and local gene density in particular, were identified as the decisive parameters. Further detailed comparisons of chromosome 7 loci in primate and tumor cells suggest that the inversions analyzed influence nuclear topology to a greater extent than the translocations, thus pointing to geometrical constraints in the 3D conformation of a chromosome territory."

In this study, we compared ape densities and habitats in the Lokoue study area in Odzala National Park and the Goualougo Triangle in Nouabale-Ndoki National Park in northern Republic of Congo. Both of these sites have long been considered strongholds for the conservation of chimpanzees and gorillas, but supposedly differ in vegetative composition and relative ape abundance. We compared habitats between these sites using conventional ground surveys and classified Landsat-7 ETM+ satellite images. We present density estimates via both standing-crop and marked-nest methods for the first time for sympatric apes of the Congo Basin. The marked-nest method was effective in depicting chimpanzee densities, but underestimated gorilla densities at both sites. Marked-nest surveys also revealed a dramatic decline in the ape population of Lokou6 which coincided with a local Ebola epidemic. Normal baseline fluctuations in ape nest encounter rates during the repeated passages of marked-nest surveys were clearly distinguishable from a 80% decline in ape nest encounter rates at Lokou6. Our results showed that ape densities, habitat composition, and population dynamics differed between these populations in northern Congo. We emphasize the importance of intensifying monitoring efforts and further refinement of ape survey methods, as our results indicated that even the largest remaining ape populations in intact and protected forests are susceptible to sudden and dramatic declines.

The subject witnessed both incidents in succession (but was unable to obtain the grapes). Shortly after, the ape had an opportunity to approach one or both human actors (nice/nasty), both of whom were now sitting side-by-side holding grapes. However, neither human offered their grapes if approached. The subject's expectation of which human was more likely to offer food was measured by comparing the proportion of time that subjects spent near each person. Chimpanzees (n = 17) spent significantly more time at the 'nice' window compared to 'nasty'. Also, preference for 'nasty' declined as trials progressed. Results for other apes were not significant.

Inferences about the location of food in capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) in two sensory modalities,"['Sabbatini, G', 'Visalberghi, E', 'DAUBENTONIA-MADAGASCARIENSIS']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/0735-7036.122.2.156,MAY 2008,29,"The authors tested the ability of capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) to make inferences about hidden food. In Experiment 1, we showed the content of 2 boxes, 1 of which was baited (visual condition, VC) or we shook both boxes producing noise from the baited box (auditory condition, AC). Seven subjects (out of 8) were above chance in the VC, whereas only I was above chance in AC. During treatment, by manipulating empty and filled objects subjects experienced the relation between noise and content. When tested again, 7 capuchins were above chance in the VC and 3 in AC. In Experiment 2, we gave visual or auditory information only about the empty box and, consequently, successful choice implied inferential reasoning. All subjects (out of 4) were above chance in the VC, and 2 in the AC. Control tests ruled out the possibility that success resulted from simply avoiding the shaken noiseless box, or from the use of arbitrary auditory information. Similar to apes (Call, 2004), capuchins were capable of inferential reasoning."
"How the great apes (Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, Pan paniscus, Gorilla gorilla) perform on the reversed reward contingency task II: Transfer to new quantities, long-term retention, and the impact of quantity ratios","['Uher, J', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/0735-7036.122.2.204,MAY 2008,24,"We tested 6 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), 3 orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), 4 bonobos (Pan paniscus), and 2 gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) in the reversed reward contingency task. Individuals were presented with pairs of quantities ranging between 0 and 6 food items. Prior to testing, some experienced apes had solved this task using 2 quantities while others were totally naive. Experienced apes transferred their ability to multiple-novel pairs after 6 to 19 months had elapsed since their initial testing. Two out of 6 naive apes (1 chimpanzee, 1 bonobo) solved the task-a proportion comparable to that of a previous study using 2 pairs of quantities. Their acquisition speed was also comparable to the successful subjects from that study. The ratio between quantities explained a large portion of the variance but affected naive and experienced individuals differently. For smaller ratios, naive individuals were well below 50% correct and experienced ones were well above 50%, yet both groups tended to converge toward 50% for larger ratios. Thus, some apes require no procedural modifications to overcome their strong bias for selecting the larger of 2 quantities."
Color preferences in gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"['Wells, DL', 'McDonald, CL', 'Ringland, JE']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/0735-7036.122.2.213,MAY 2008,9,"Color plays an important biological role in the lives of many animals, with some species exhibiting preferences for certain colors over others. This study explored the color preferences of two species of ape, which, like humans, possess trichromatic color vision. Six western lowland gorillas, and six chimpanzees, housed in Belfast Zoological Gardens, were exposed to three stimuli (cloths, boxes, sheets of acetate) in red, blue, and green. Six stimuli of the same nature, in each of the three colors, were provided to both species for 5 days per stimulus. The amount of interest that the animals showed toward each stimulus of each color was recorded for 1 hr. Results showed that the apes, both when analyzed as two separate groups, and when assessed collectively, showed significant color preferences, paying significantly less attention to the red-, than to the blue- or green-colored stimuli. The animals' interest in the blue- and green-colored stimuli did not differ significantly. Overall, the findings suggest that gorillas and chimpanzees, our closest living relatives, may harbor color preferences comparable to those of humans and other species."
"Great apes' (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus) understanding of tool functional properties after limited experience","['Herrmann, E', 'Wobber, V', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1037/0735-7036.122.2.220,MAY 2008,33,"Primates' understanding of tool functionality has been investigated extensively using a paradigm in which subjects are presented with a tool that they must use to obtain an out-of-reach reward. After being given experience on an initial problem, monkeys can transfer their skill to tools of different shapes while ignoring irrelevant tool changes (e.g., color). In contrast, monkeys without initial training perform poorly on the same tasks. Compared to most monkeys, great apes show a clear propensity for tool using and may not require as much experience to succeed on tool functionality tasks. We investigated this question by presenting 171 apes (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla gorilla, and Pongo pygmaeus) with several tool-use problems without giving them initial training or familiarizing them with the test materials. Apes succeeded without experience, but only on problems based on basic properties such as the reward being supported by an object. However, only minimal experience was sufficient to allow them to quickly improve their performance on more complex problems in which the reward was not in contact with the tool."
"Chimerism, point mutation, and truncation dramatically transformed mast cell delta-tryptases during primate evolution","['Trivedi, NN', 'Raymond, WW', 'Caughey, GH']",JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY,10.1016/j.jaci.2008.01.019,MAY 2008,16,"Background: Tryptases are serine peptidases stored in mast cell granules. Rodents express 2 soluble tryptases, mast cell proteases (MCPs) 6 and 7. Human alpha- and beta-tryptases are orthologs of MCP-6. However, much of the ancestral MCP-7 ortholog was replaced by parts of other tryptases, creating chimeric delta-tryptase. Human delta-tryptase's limited activity is hypothesized to be due to truncation and processing mutations.

Objective: We sought to probe the origins and consequences of mutations in primate delta-tryptases.

Methods: Prosimian (lemur), monkey (macaque), great ape (orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee), and human delta-tryptase genes were identified by means of data mining and genomic sequencing. Resulting genes were analyzed phylogenetically and structurally.

Results: The seminal conversion event generating the delta-tryptase chimera occurred early because all primates studied contain delta-tryptase genes. Truncation, resulting from a nonsense mutation of Trp206, occurred much later, after orangutans and other great apes last shared an ancestor. The Arg-3Gln propeptide mutation occurred most recently, being present in humans and chimpanzees but not in other primates. Surprisingly, the major active tryptase in monkeys is full-length delta-tryptase, not beta-tryptase, which is the main active tryptase in human subjects. Models of macaque delta-tryptase reveal that the segment truncated in human subjects contains antiparallel beta-strands coursing through the substrate-binding cleft, accounting for truncation's drastic effect on activity.

Conclusions: Transformations in the ancestral MCP-7-like gene during primate evolution caused dramatic variations in function. Although delta-tryptases are nearly inactive in humans, they are active and dominant in monkeys."
[Complete sequence determination and phylogenetic analysis of FKN among seven higher primates including homonids and Old World Monkeys].,"['Hong, Xiao-Wu', 'Zhang, Ya-Ping', 'Chu, Yi-Wei', 'Gao, Hai-Feng', 'Jiang, Zheng-Gang', 'Xiong, Si-Dong']",Yi chuan = Hereditas / Zhongguo yi chuan xue hui bian ji,NA,2008-May,0,"To obtain full-length FKN nucleotide sequences of homonids including human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and gibbon, and Old World Monkeys including macaque and leaf monkey and make phylogenetic analysis, three exons of FKN were amplified by degenerated PCR using obtained peripheral blood cells DNA as template which was extracted from homonids and Old World Monkeys. After extracting and purifying from agarose gels, PCR products were sequenced and then spliced by using BioEdit. All the FKN sequences were aligned and compared the percent identity by using DNAStar. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using maximum evolution approach in Mega. The negative selection sites were analyzed by using Datamonkey. There is an apparent 30 bp nucleotides deletion mutation in homonids FKN comparing to that of Old World Monkeys besides other point mutations. Homology of nucleotide sequence between human and chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, macaque and leaf monkey is 99.2%, 98.4%, 98.1%, 96.5%, 95.9% and 93.8%, respectively. Homology of amino acid sequence of them is 98.5%, 98.0%, 97.7%, 94.7%, 93.7% and 90.5%, respectively. In the same time, the genealogical relationship of human is a lot closer to chimpanzee than it is to gorilla and other apes. It is generally agreed that the evolution rule of FKN gene is in accord with that of the higher primates. In addition, Datamonkey shows that there are 3 negative selection sites 53Q, 84D and 239N in FKN. The full-length FKN gene of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, macaque and leaf monkey were sequenced successfully, and the FKN sequences analysis lays the foundation for further studying its evolution in immunological function in higher primates and the relation between its structure and function."
Influence of male morphology on male mating status and behavior during interunit encounters in western lowland gorillas,"['Caillaud, D', 'Levrero, F', 'Gatti, S', 'Menard, N', 'Raymond, M']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20754,APR 2008,30,"The western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) is one of the most sexually dimorphic primate species. Mature males are twice the size of females and have grey fur on their backs and a fibrous, adipose crest on their heads. Such traits are likely to have evolved by sexual selection, either because they confer advantages during male-male fights or because females prefer males with more dimorphic traits. We developed photogrammetric methods for distance collection of morphological data from silverback males frequenting the Lokoue forest clearing in Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Republic of the Congo. Body length, head-crest size, musculature development, and extent of the grey color on the back were assessed in 87 nonbreeding and breeding mature males. Behavioral data were also collected during 312 male-male encounters involving 67 mature males in order to estimate their level of aggressiveness. The number of females belonging to a mature male positively correlated with the male crest size, body length, and musculature. Whereas morphological variables did not significantly affect the intensity of male-male encounters, the number of females attending male-male encounters strongly affected the number of agonistic displays by the two males. We discuss the mechanisms through which males with more exaggerated traits could obtain a mating advantage, namely male-male fights or female mate choice."
Mechanical analysis of infant carrying in hominoids,"['Amaral, LQ']",NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN,10.1007/s00114-007-0325-0,APR 2008,4,"In all higher nonhuman primates, species survival depends upon safe carrying of infants clinging to body hair of adults. In this work, measurements of mechanical properties of ape hair (gibbon, orangutan, and gorilla) are presented, focusing on constraints for safe infant carrying. Results of hair tensile properties are shown to be species-dependent. Analysis of the mechanics of the mounting position, typical of heavier infant carrying among African apes, shows that both clinging and friction are necessary to carry heavy infants. As a consequence, a required relationship between infant weight, hair-hair friction coefficient, and body angle exists. The hair-hair friction coefficient is measured using natural ape skin samples, and dependence on load and humidity is analyzed. Numerical evaluation of the equilibrium constraint is in agreement with the knuckle-walking quadruped position of African apes. Bipedality is clearly incompatible with the usual clinging and mounting pattern of infant carrying, requiring a revision of models of hominization in relation to the divergence between apes and hominins. These results suggest that safe carrying of heavy infants justify the emergence of biped form of locomotion. Ways to test this possibility are foreseen here."
The evolutionary role of modularity and integration in the hominoid cranium,"['Mitteroecker, P', 'Bookstein, F', 'MAMMALIAN SKULL VAULT']",EVOLUTION,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00321.x,APR 2008,111,"Patterns of morphological integration and modularity among shape features emerge from genetic and developmental factors with varying pleiotropic effects. Factors or processes affecting morphology only locally may respond to selection more easily than common factors that may lead to deleterious side effects and hence are expected to be more conserved. We briefly review evidence for such global factors in primate cranial development as well as for local factors constrained to either the face or the neurocranium. In a sample comprising 157 crania of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Gorilla gorilla, we statistically estimated common and local factors of shape variation from Procrustes coordinates of 347 landmarks and semilandmarks. Common factors with pleiotropic effects on both the face and the neurocranium account for a large amount of shape variation, but mainly by extension or truncation of otherwise conserved developmental pathways. Local factors (modular shape characteristics) have more degrees of freedom for evolutionary change than mere ontogenetic scaling. Cranial shape is similarly integrated during development in all three species, but human evolution involves dissociation among several characteristics. The dissociation has probably been achieved by evolutionary alterations and by the novel emergence of local factors affecting characteristics that are controlled at the same time by the common factors."
Hominin life history: reconstruction and evolution,"['Robson, SL', 'Wood, B', 'SOUTH-AFRICAN AUSTRALOPITHECINES']",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2008.00867.x,APR 2008,125,"In this review we attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary history of hominin life history from extant and fossil evidence. We utilize demographic life history theory and distinguish life history variables, traits such as weaning, age at sexual maturity, and life span, from life history-related variables such as body mass, brain growth, and dental development. The latter are either linked with, or can be used to make inferences about, life history, thus providing an opportunity for estimating life history parameters in fossil taxa. We compare the life history variables of modern great apes and identify traits that are likely to be shared by the last common ancestor of Pan-Homo and those likely to be derived in hominins. All great apes exhibit slow life histories and we infer this to be true of the last common ancestor of Pan-Homo and the stem hominin. Modern human life histories are even slower, exhibiting distinctively long post-menopausal life spans and later ages at maturity, pointing to a reduction in adult mortality since the Pan-Homo split. We suggest that lower adult mortality, distinctively short interbirth intervals, and early weaning characteristic of modern humans are derived features resulting from cooperative breeding. We evaluate the fidelity of three life history-related variables, body mass, brain growth and dental development, with the life history parameters of living great apes. We found that body mass is the best predictor of great ape life history events. Brain growth trajectories and dental development and eruption are weakly related proxies and inferences from them should be made with caution. We evaluate the evidence of life history-related variables available for extinct species and find that prior to the transitional hominins there is no evidence of any hominin taxon possessing a body size, brain size or aspects of dental development much different from what we assume to be the primitive life history pattern for the Pan-Homo clade. Data for life history-related variables among the transitional hominin grade are consistent and none agrees with a modern human pattern. Aside from mean body mass, adult brain size, crown and root formation times, and the timing and sequence of dental eruption of Homo erectus are inconsistent with that of modern humans. Homo antecessor fossil material suggests a brain size similar to that of Homo erectus s. s., and crown formation times that are not yet modern, though there is some evidence of modern human-like timing of tooth formation and eruption. The body sizes, brain sizes, and dental development of Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis are consistent with a modern human life history but samples are too small to be certain that they have life histories within the modern human range. As more life history-related variable information for hominin species accumulates we are discovering that they can also have distinctive life histories that do not conform to any living model. At least one extinct hominin subclade, Paranthropus, has a pattern of dental life history-related variables that most likely set it apart from the life histories of both modern humans and chimpanzees."
On novel representation of proteins based on amino acid adjacency matrix,"['Randic, M', 'Novic, M', 'Vracko, M']",SAR AND QSAR IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,10.1080/10629360802085082,2008,31,"A novel characterization of proteins is presented based on selected properties of recently introduced 20 x 20 amino acid adjacency matrix of proteins in which matrix elements count the occurrence of all 400 possible pair-wise adjacencies obtained by reading protein primary sequence from the left to the right.

The approach is illustrated on a set of ND6 proteins of eight species."
Orrorin tugenensis femoral morphology and the evolution of hominin bipedalism,"['Richmond, BG', 'Jungers, WL', 'AUSTRALOPITHECUS-AFARENSIS']",SCIENCE,10.1126/science.1154197,MAR 21 2008,81,"Bipedalism is a key human adaptation and a defining feature of the hominin clade. Fossil femora discovered in Kenya and attributed to Orrorin tugenensis, at 6 million years ago, purportedly provide the earliest postcranial evidence of hominin bipedalism, but their functional and phylogenetic affinities are controversial. We show that the O. tugenensis femur differs from those of apes and Homo and most strongly resembles those of Australopithecus and Paranthropus, indicating that O. tugenensis was bipedal but is not more closely related to Homo than to Australopithecus. Femoral morphology indicates that O. tugenensis shared distinctive hip biomechanics with australopiths, suggesting that this complex evolved early in human evolution and persisted for almost 4 million years until modifications of the hip appeared in the late Pliocene in early Homo."
Patterns of paternity and group fission in wild multimale mountain gorilla groups,"['Nsubuga, AM', 'Robbins, MM', 'Boesch, C', 'Vigilant, L']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20740,MAR 2008,23,"To understand variation among social systems, it is essential to know the relative reproductive success of individuals in group-living species. Particularly interesting for such studies are taxa such as mountain gorillas in which both one-male and multimale groups are common, because of the opportunity to estimate the costs and benefits to males of pursuing different reproductive strategies. We genotyped 68 individuals from two groups of multimale mountain gorilla groups in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda to determine the distribution of paternity among the males. In both groups, the dominant male sired the majority of offspring. One group underwent a fission, and we found that the eight offspring assigned to the dominant silverback (and their mothers) remained with their father, while the two offspring of unknown paternity ended up in the small group headed by the formerly subordinate silverback. This is consistent with the proposal that the outcome of group fission in primates is not only influenced by maternal relationships among individuals, but also by patrilineal relationships. Results of this study show that subordinate males may gain reproductive benefits even while queuing for dominance status. Despite ecological differences between Bwindi and the Virunga Volcanoes, male mountain gorillas living in both populations benefit from remaining in multimale groups."
Strong postcranial size dimorphism in Australopithecus afarensis: Results from two new resampling methods for multivariate data sets with missing data,"['Gordon, AD', 'Green, DJ', 'Richmond, BG']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20745,MAR 2008,39,"There is considerable debate over the level of size dimorphism and inferred social behavior of Australopithecus afarensis. Most previous studies have analyzed size variation in single variables or multiple variables drawn from single elements. These approaches suffer from small sample sizes, underscoring the need for new techniques that incorporate measurements from multiple unassociated elements, reducing the influence of random sampling on size variation in fossil samples. One such technique, the template method, has recently been proposed but is limited to samples with a template specimen and is sensitive to a number of assumptions. Here we present two new resampling methods that do not require a template specimen, allow measurements from multiple unassociated elements to be included in a single analysis, and allow for significance tests between comparative and fossil multivariate data sets with missing data. Using these new methods, multivariate postcranial size dimorphism is measured using eight measurements of the femur, tibia, humerus, and radius in samples of A. afarensis, modern humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. Postcranial dimorphism in A. afarensis is similar to that of gorillas and orangutans, and significantly greater than in modern humans and chimpanzees. Because studies in living primates have examined the association of behavior with dimorphism in body mass and craniodental measurements, not postcrania, relationships between postcranial dimorphism and social behavior must be established to make robust behavioral inferences for A. afarensis. However, the results of this and past studies strongly suggest behavioral and mating strategies differed between A. afarensis and modern humans."
Animal consciousness,"['Beshkar, M']",JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES,NA,MAR 2008,3,"There are several types of behavioural evidence in favour of,the. notion that many animal species experience at least some simple levels of consciousness. Other than behavioural evidence, there are a number of anatomical and physiological criteria that help resolve the problem of animal consciousness, particularly when addressing the problem in lower vertebrates and invertebrates.

In this paper I review a number of such behavioural and brain-based evidence in the case of mammals, birds, and some invertebrate species. Cumulative evidence strongly suggests that consciousness, of one form or another is present in mammals and birds. Although supportive evidence is less strong in the case of invertebrates, it is more likely than not that they also experience some simple levels of consciousness."
Identification and molecular characterization of new STLV-1 and STLV-3 strains in wild-caught nonhuman primates in Cameroon,"['Liegeois, F', 'Lafay, B', 'Switzer, WM', 'Locatelli, S', 'Mpoudi-Ngole, E', 'Loul, S', 'Heneine, W', 'Delaporte, E', 'Peeters, M']",VIROLOGY,10.1016/j.virol.2007.09.037,FEB 20 2008,31,"Humans and simian species are infected by deltaretroviruses (HTLV and STLV respectively), which are collectively called primate T-cell lymphotropic viruses (PTLVs). In humans, four types of HTLV have been described (HTLV-1 to -4) with three of them having closely related simian virus analogues named STLV-1, 2 and 3. In this study, our aim was to search for a simian HTLV-4-related virus and to document and characterize further the diversity of STLV infections in wild primate populations. We screened 1297 whole blood samples from 13 different primate species from southern Cameroon. Overall, 93 samples gave HTLV-1, HTLV-2 or dual HTLV-1/-2 INNOLIA profiles, 12 were HTLV positive but untypeable and 14 were indeterminate. Subsequently, we performed generic and specific (STLV-1 to -3) tax-rex PCRs to discriminate the different PTLV types, completed with phylogenetic analysis of 450-bp LTR sequences for STLV-1 and 900 bp pX-LTR sequences for STLV-3. We show for the first time that Lophocebus albigena and Cercopithecus cephus carry both STLV-1 and a divergent STLV-3. We also identified a new STLV-1 lineage in one C. cephus. Finally, we identify relative divergence levels in the tax/rex phylogeny suggesting that additional types of PTLV should be defined, particularly for the highly divergent STLV-1(MarB43) strain that we provisionally name STLV-5.

The development of feeding behaviour in wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla),"['Nowell, AA', 'Fletcher, AW']",BEHAVIOUR,10.1163/156853907783244747,FEB 2008,7,"Before being weaned, young primates must learn which plant species are suitable to eat, and how to process and combine them to meet their nutritional needs. This study provides a detailed investigation of the development of feeding behaviour in a wild population of western lowland gorillas observed in a bai habitat. The behaviour of 56 known immature individuals aged between 0 and 8 years was recorded at Mbeli Bai, Republic of Congo, using focal, scan and all-occurrence sampling over a period of 16 months. Results indicated that independent feeding skills were acquired by the end of infancy and did not undergo significant change beyond this point. However, suckling continued into the juvenile period, suggesting that some continued investment by the mother was necessary until the strength and skills of immatures developed, perhaps to enable self-sufficiency through periods of succulent fruit (assumed to be the most suitable weaning food) scarcity. This was supported by observations of an increase in feeding-related behaviour with age, particularly during infancy. Additionally, age-related differences in the species and plant parts selected by different age classes, as well as in levels of food processing, were apparent. Play feeding, suggested to be a precursor to independent feeding, was most prevalent in infancy, decreasing as feeding skills developed. Thus, it would appear, given that food transfer also occurs (Nowell & Fletcher, 2006), that feeding skills in western lowland gorillas are learned by a combination of exposure to and manipulation of food items, and probably also through the observation of conspecifics. Observations in a forest habitat are needed to improve our understanding of feeding development in this subspecies."
Ape metaphysics: Object individuation without language,"['Mendes, N', 'Rakoczy, H', 'Call, J']",COGNITION,10.1016/j.cognition.2007.04.007,FEB 2008,21,"Developmental research suggests that whereas very young infants individuate objects purely on spatiotemporal grounds, from (at latest) around 1 year of age children are capable of individuating objects according to the kind they belong to and the properties they instantiate. As the latter ability has been found to correlate with language, some have speculated whether it might be essentially language dependent and therefore uniquely human. Existing studies with non-human primates seem to speak against this hypothesis, but fail to present conclusive evidence due to methodological shortcomings. In the present experiments we set out to test non-linguistic object individuation in three great ape species with a refined manual search methodology. Experiment 1 tested for spatiotemporal object individuation: Subjects saw 1 or 2 objects simultaneously being placed inside a box in which they could reach, and then in both conditions only found 1 object. After retrieval of the 1 object, subjects reached again significantly more often when they had seen 2 than when they had seen 1 object. Experiment 2 tested for object individuation according to property/kind information only: Subjects saw 1 object being placed inside the box, and then either found that object (expected) or an object of a different kind (unexpected). Analogously to Experiment 1, after retrieval of the 1 object, subjects reached again significantly more often in the unexpected than in the expected condition. These results thus confirm previous findings suggesting that individuating objects according to their property/kind is neither uniquely human nor essentially language dependent. It remains to be seen, however, whether this kind of object individuation requires sortal concepts as human linguistic thinkers use them, or whether some simpler form of tracking properties is sufficient.

Comparative observations on the tooth root morphology of Gigantopithecus blacki,"['Kupczik, K', 'Dean, MC']",JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.09.013,FEB 2008,34,"The extinct great ape Gigantopithecus blacki from the middle Pleistocene of China and Vietnam is known only from dental and mandibular remains, and its dietary specializations remain contentious. Here, for the first time, we describe the root morphology in G. blacki using computed tomography and three-dimensional image processing. We quantify the tooth root lengths and surface areas of the female G. blacki mandible No. I from the Liucheng Cave and compare it to a sample of extant great apes and humans, as well as the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and the American black bear (Ursus americanus). The results show that, in G. blacki, the pattern of mandibular root numbers-particularly that of the premolars-corresponds with that of Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Pongo pygmaeus. However, G. blacki can be distinguished from the extant hominids by having relatively higher values for postcanine root length and surface area, both absolutely and relative to mandibular size (except for premolar root lengths of humans). The relatively large postcanine root surface areas, which are most similar to A. melanoleuca, suggest that the dentition of G. blacki was adapted to sustaining relatively large occlusal forces needed to fracture mechanically resistant foods such as bamboo.

"Nutritional quality of gorilla diets: consequences of age, sex, and season","['Rothman, JM', 'Dierenfeld, ES', 'Hintz, HF', 'Pell, AN']",OECOLOGIA,10.1007/s00442-007-0901-1,FEB 2008,45,"We tested the effects of age, sex, and season on the nutritional strategies of a group of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. Through observations of food intake of individual gorillas and nutritional analyses of dietary components over different seasons and environments, we estimated nutrient intake and evaluated diet adequacy. Our results suggest that the nutritional costs of reproduction and growth affect nutrient intake; growing juveniles and adult females ate more food and more protein per kilogram of metabolic body mass than did silverbacks. The diets of silverback males, adult females, and juveniles contained similar concentrations of protein, fiber, and sugar, indicating that adult females and juveniles did not select higher protein foods than silverbacks but rather consumed more dry matter to ingest more protein. Juveniles consumed more minerals (Ca, P, Mg, K, Fe, Zn, Mn, Mo) per kilogram of body mass than adult females and silverback males, and juveniles consumed diets with higher concentrations of phosphorous, iron, and zinc, indicating that the foods they ate contained higher concentrations of these minerals. Seasonally, the amount of food consumed on a dry weight basis did not vary, but with increased frugivory, dietary concentrations of protein and fiber decreased and those of water-soluble carbohydrates increased. Energy intake did not change over the year. With the exception of sodium, gorillas ate diets that exceeded human nutrient requirements. A better understanding of the relative importance of food quantity and quality for different age-sex classes provides insights into the ways in which gorillas may be limited by food resources when faced with environmental heterogeneity."
Gorillas are a host for Dientamoeba fragilis: An update on the life cycle and host distribution,"['Stark, D', 'Phillips, O', 'Peckett, D', 'Munro, U', 'Marriott, D', 'Harkness, J', 'Ellis, J']",VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY,10.1016/j.vetpar.2007.10.002,JAN 25 2008,16,"Dientamoeba fragilis is a gastrointestinal protozoan that has a worldwide distribution and is emergeing as a common cause of diarrhea. As D. fragilis has a propensity to cause chronic illness with symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) it is not surprising that some patients with D. fragilis are misdiagnosed as having IBS. In contrast to most other pathogenic protozoa very little is known about its life cycle, epidemiology and mode of transmission. What role animal reservoirs play in the transmission of this parasite is unknown. Consequently we undertook a prospective study to determine the host distribution of D. fragilis. Over a 2-year-period, 608 faecal samples from a wide range of animal and bird species, including pigs and other food species, were screened using permanent stained smears for the presence of D. fragilis. Trophozoites of D. fragilis were only detected in Western lowland gorillas (3/10) (Gorilla g. gorilla) and confirmed by PCR targeting the SSU rRNA gene. The limited host range detected suggests human infection may not involve transmission from other animal species. In addition, we provide an update on the limited knowledge about the life cycle of this parasite and its host distribution. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
New insights in insect prey choice by chimpanzees and gorillas in southeast Cameroon: The role of nutritional value,"['Deblauwe, I', 'Janssens, GPJ']",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,10.1002/ajpa.20703,JAN 2008,42,"The insect diet of chimpanzees and gorillas living at the northern periphery of the Dja Biosphere Reserve in southeast Cameroon and its nutritional contribution is described. We analyzed fecal samples and recorded additional evidence of insectivory. A detailed prey species list is presented for both apes. We carried out nutritional analyses (macronutrients, macro- and micro-minerals) on 11 important and eight nonimportant, but. accessible, ant and termite prey species, and estimated the average nutrient intake/day through insects. Although gorillas ate insects more frequently, the average prey biomass intake/day by chimpanzees was twice that by gorillas. The lack of tool-use by gorillas cannot be the main reason for the small overlap of important prey species. Both apes did not seem to consume ant prey for one or more specific nutrients. Also other factors, such as medicinal use, should be considered. Termites, on the other hand, seemed to be selected for particular nutrients. Gorilla intake of the important termite prey, Cubitermes and Thoracotermes, met with estimated iron requirements. Their potential role as antidiarrheal treatment is as yet unclear. Chimpanzee intake of the important termite prey, Macrotermes spp., met with estimated manganese requirements and the protein intake/day (mean: 2 g/d) reached significant values (> 20 g/d). To fully understand the importance of nutritional contributions of insects to ape diets in Cameroon, the chemical composition and nutrient intake of fruit and foliage in their diets should be investigated."

Its adoptability and usefulness for animal studies are tested exemplarily on a sample of 20 zoo-housed great apes (five of each of the following species): bonobos, Pan paniscus; chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus; gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla; and orang-utans, Pongo pygmaeus abelii. Data on 76 single trait-relevant behaviours were recorded in a series of 14 laboratory-based situations and in two different group situations. Data collection was repeated completely after a break of 2 weeks within a 50-day period. All behaviour records were sufficiently reliable. Individual- and variable-oriented analyses showed high/substantial temporal stability on different levels of aggregation. Distinctive and stable individual situational and response profiles clarified the importance of situations and of multiple trait-relevant behaviours. The present study calls for a closer collaboration between behavioural biologists and personality psychologists to tap the full potential of animal personality research.

Behavioral cues that great apes use to forage for hidden food,"['Buttelmann, D', 'Call, J', 'Tomasello, M']",ANIMAL COGNITION,10.1007/s10071-007-0095-2,JAN 2008,5,"We conducted three studies to examine whether the four great ape species (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) are able to use behavioral experimenter-given cues in an object-choice task. In the subsequent experimental conditions subjects were presented with two eggs, one of which contained food and the other did not. In Study 1 the experimenter examined both eggs by smelling or shaking them, but only made a failed attempt to open (via biting) the egg containing food. In a control condition, the experimenter examined and attempted to open both eggs, but in reverse order to control for stimulus enhancement. The apes significantly preferred the egg that was first examined and then bitten, but had no preference in a baseline condition in which there were no cues. In Study 2, we investigated whether the apes could extend this ability to cues not observed in apes so far (i.e., attempting to pull apart the egg), as well as whether they made this discrimination based on the function of the action the experimenter performed. Subjects significantly preferred eggs presented with this novel cue, but did not prefer eggs presented with a novel but functionally irrelevant action. In Study 3, apes did not interpret human actions as cues to food-location when they already knew that the eggs were empty. Thus, great apes were able to use a variety of experimenter-given cues associated with foraging actions to locate hidden food and thereby were partially sensitive to the general purpose underlying these actions."
Between-groups within-gene heterogeneity of residual variances in microarray gene expression data,"['Casellas, J', 'Varona, L']",BMC GENOMICS,10.1186/1471-2164-9-319,JUL 4 2008,3,"Background: The analysis of microarray gene expression data typically tries to identify differential gene expression patterns in terms of differences of the mathematical expectation between groups of arrays (e.g. treatments or biological conditions). Nevertheless, the differential expression pattern could also be characterized by group-specific dispersion patterns, although little is known about this phenomenon in microarray data. Commonly, a homogeneous gene-specific residual variance is assumed in hierarchical mixed models for gene expression data, although it could result in substantial biases if this assumption is not true.

Results: In this manuscript, a hierarchical mixed model with within-gene heterogeneous residual variances is proposed to analyze gene expression data from non-competitive hybridized microarrays. Moreover, a straightforward Bayes factor is adapted to easily check within-gene (between groups) heterogeneity of residual variances when samples are grouped in two different treatments. This Bayes factor only requires the analysis of the complex model (hierarchical mixed model with between-groups heterogeneous residual variances for all analyzed genes) and gene-specific Bayes factors are provided from the output of a simple Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.

Conclusion: This statistical development opens new research possibilities within the gene expression framework, where heterogeneity in residual variability could be viewed as an alternative and plausible characterization of differential expression patterns."
Evaluating orangutan census techniques using nest decay rates: Implications for population estimates,"['Mathewson, PD', 'Spehar, SN', 'Meijaard, E', 'Nardiyono', 'Purnomo', 'Sasmirul, A', 'Sudiyanto', 'Oman', 'Sulhnudin', 'Jasary', 'Jumali', 'Marshall, AJ']",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,10.1890/07-0385.1,JAN 2008,22,"An accurate estimate for orangutan nest decay time is a crucial factor in commonly used methods for estimating orangutan population size. Decay rates are known to vary, but the decay process and, thus, the temporal and spatial variation in decay time are poorly understood. We used established line-transect methodology to survey orangutan nests in a lowland forest in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, and monitored the decay of 663 nests over 20 months. Using Markov chain analysis we calculated a decay time of 602 days, which is significantly longer than times found in other studies. Based on this, we recalculated the orangutan density estimate for a site in East Kalimantan; the resulting density is much lower than previous estimates (previous estimates were 3-8 times higher than our recalculated density). Our data suggest that short-term studies where decay times are determined using matrix mathematics may produce unreliable decay times. Our findings have implications for other parts of the orangutan range where population estimates are based on potentially unreliable nest decay rate estimates, and we recommend that for various parts of the orangutan range census estimates be reexamined. Considering the high variation in decay rates there is a need to move away from using single-number decay time estimates and, preferably, to test methods that do not rely on nest decay times as alternatives for rapid assessments of orangutan habitat for conservation in Borneo."

We carried out two annual censuses of western lowland gorilla ( e. g. gorilla) and chimpanzee populations (Pan t. troglodytes) in an active logging concession in Southeast Cameroon. The results suggest that gorillas may adapt their range use to avoid most recently logged compartments, while chimpanzees appear to be more spatially resilient to logging. In our study site, selective logging affected 10% of the forest. After logging, gorillas nested in all types of vegetation, while chimpanzees nested exclusively in mixed mature forest. Fruit availability was not affected by logging and did not explain the distribution of ape nests in the study area."
Hominoid chromosomal rearrangements on 17q map to complex regions of segmental duplication,"['Cardone, MF', 'Jiang, ZS', ""D'Addabbo, P"", 'Archidiacono, N', 'Rocchi, M', 'Eichler, EE', 'Ventura, M']",GENOME BIOLOGY,10.1186/gb-2008-9-2-r28,2008,15,"Background: Chromosomal rearrangements, such as translocations and inversions, are recurrent phenomena during evolution, and both of them are involved in reproductive isolation and speciation. To better understand the molecular basis of chromosome rearrangements and their part in karyotype evolution, we have investigated the history of human chromosome 17 by comparative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and sequence analysis.

Results: Human bacterial artificial chromosome/pI artificial chromosome probes spanning the length of chromosome 17 were used in FISH experiments on great apes, Old World monkeys and New World monkeys to study the evolutionary history of this chromosome. We observed that the macaque marker order represents the ancestral organization. Human, chimpanzee and gorilla homologous chromosomes differ by a paracentric inversion that occurred specifically in the Homo sapiens/Pan troglodytes/Gorilla gorilla ancestor. Detailed analyses of the paracentric inversion revealed that the breakpoints mapped to two regions syntenic to human 17q12/21 and 17q23, both rich in segmental duplications.

Conclusion: Sequence analyses of the human and macaque organization suggest that the duplication events occurred in the catarrhine ancestor with the duplication blocks continuing to duplicate or undergo gene conversion during evolution of the hominoid lineage. We propose that the presence of these duplicons has mediated the inversion in the H. sapiens/P. troglodytes/G. gorilla ancestor. Recently, the same duplication blocks have been shown to be polymorphic in the human population and to be involved in triggering microdeletion and duplication in human. These results further support a model where genomic architecture has a direct role in both rearrangement involved in karyotype evolution and genomic instability in human."
Enthesis bilateral asymmetry in humans and African apes,"['Drapeau, MSM']",HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY,10.1016/j.jchb.2007.12.004,2008,10,"Entheses (skeletal muscle and tendon attachment sites) have often been used to infer handedness and activity variability among human populations. However, the specific roles that intensity vs. frequency of muscle contractions play in modifying entheses are not well understood and the assumption that entheses reflect muscle activity levels has been challenged. This study explores the effect of habitual muscular activity on enthesis morphology in humans and African apes by investigating bilateral asymmetry in the forelimbs and hindlimbs of these taxa. Humans have generally more developed entheses in the lower limb while African apes have generally more developed entheses in the forelimbs. All species studied have more asymmetric forelimbs than hindlimbs except humans that show more asymmetrical expression of bony spurs in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. When comparing species, humans are always more asymmetric in ethesis development than apes for both the forelimbs and hindlimbs, which reflects the relatively greater asymmetry in limb use in humans and the more symmetric use in apes. Enthesis development may reflect cross-symmetry patterns in humans and, more subtly, a moderate handedness in apes during manipulative activities. This study suggests that enthesis morphology provides information on muscle activity levels, with greater development of entheses associated with more habitual or powerful muscle use. The general similarity of ape and human responses to muscle activity suggests that muscle activity influenced enthesis development in Plio-Pleistocene hominins and that interpretation of muscle markings in these fossils can provide data for functional inferences in these extinct species.

"Prevalence and genetic diversity of simian immunodeficiency virus infection in wild-living red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus badius badius) From the Tai forest, Cote d'Ivoire SIV wrc in wild-living western red colobus monkeys","['Locatelli, S', 'Liegeois, F', 'Lafay, B', 'Roeder, AD', 'Bruford, MW', 'Formenty, P', 'Noe, R', 'Delaporte, E', 'Peeters, M']",INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.meegid.2007.08.004,JAN 2008,17,"Numerous African primates are infected with simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). It is now well established that the clade of SIVs infecting west-central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) represent the progenitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), whereas HIV-2 results from different cross-species transmissions of SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys).

We present here the first molecular epidemiological survey of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVwrc) in wild-living western red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus badius badius) which are frequently hunted by the human population and represent a favourite prey of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). We collected faecal samples (n = 88) and we assessed individual discrimination by microsatellite analyses and visual observation. We tested the inferred 53 adult individuals belonging to two neighbouring habituated groups for presence of SIVwrc infection by viral RNA (vRNA) detection. We amplified viral polymerase (pol) (650 bp) and/or envelope (env) (570 bp) sequences in 14 individuals, resulting in a minimal prevalence of 26% among the individuals sampled, possibly reaching 50% when considering the relatively low sensitivity of viral RNA detection in faecal samples. With a few exceptions, phylogenetic analysis of pol and env sequences revealed a low degree of intragroup genetic diversity and a general viral clustering related to the social group of origin. However, we found a higher intergroup diversity. Behavioural and demographic data collected previously from these communities indicate that red colobus monkeys live in promiscuous multi-male societies, where females leave their natal group at the sub-adult stage of their lives and where extra-group copulations or male immigration have been rarely observed. The phylogenetic data we obtained seem to reflect these behavioural characteristics. Overall, our results indicate that wild-living red colobus represent a substantial reservoir of SIVwrc. Moreover, because of their frequent association with other monkey species, the predation pressure exerted by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and by poachers around and inside the park, simian to simian and simian to human SlVwrc cross-species transmission cannot be excluded.

Perimenopause and menopause: documenting life changes in aging female gorillas.,"['Atsalis, Sylvia', 'Margulis, Susan W']",Interdisciplinary topics in gerontology,10.1159/000137704,2008,12,"As our closest living relatives, great apes likely experience physiological patterns associated with reproductive aging that are similar to humans. We present results from a nationwide zoo-based study on female western lowland gorillas during which we evaluated concentrations of progestogens via daily fecal sampling in 30 gorillas, 22 of whom were geriatric (>or=30). Whereas control females cycled regularly, ca. 23% of geriatric females were acyclic (menopausal), and approximately 1/3 showed variable hormonal patterns suggestive of perimenopause. Patterns included increased cycle variability, low luteal phase rises of progestogens - possibly indicative of anovulatory cycling - and peak height variability of progestogens in the luteal phase of the cycle. We discovered a progressive trend toward increased variability in estrous cycle length and toward decreased concentrations of fecal progestogens when we compared control to geriatric cycling and to geriatric noncycling females. Noncycling females had significantly lower overall progestogen concentrations than the cycling females, though differences were not significant when cycle phase was incorporated. Preliminary analyses of follow-up data on 10 perimenopausal females indicated that subjects experienced age-related changes in reproductive function that mirrored those observed in aging human females including a female who transitioned from perimenopause to menopause. To date, maximum longevity in captive female gorillas is 52 years, with poor reproductive prognosis beginning from the age of 37 suggesting a postreproductive lifespan of >25%. Continued study of aging apes is warranted, with emphasis on longitudinal monitoring of aged subjects."
The evolution of handedness in humans and great apes: a review and current issues,"['Cashmore, L', 'Uomini, N', 'Chapelain, A']",JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES,NA,2008,64,"Population-level right-handedness is a defining characteristic of humans. Despite extensive research, we still do not know the conditions or timing of its emergence in human evolution. We present a review of research into the origins of handedness, based on fossil and archaeological data for hand preference and great ape hand-use. The data show that skeletal asymmetries in arm and hand hones supporting a right-sided dominance were present at least in the genus Homo, although data are more robust for Neanderthals, The evidence from tool-use, production, and cave art confirms that right-hand preference was established in Neanderthals and was maintained until the present. The great apes can provide real-life models for testing the conditions that facilitate or enhance hand preference at both the individual and group levels. The database on great ape hand-use indicates that they do exhibit hand preferences, especially in complex tasks. However, their preferences vary between tasks, and while group-level biases have occasionally been reported, no human-like handedness bias has been found. We discuss the methodological problems encountered in these approaches. Shared problems include a lack of agreed terminology both within and between disciplines, small sample sizes, interpretation biases and a failure to replicate experiments. In general, there is a paucity of fossil material with poor preservation hampering traditional metric methods. The archaeological data are often founded on unreliable methods. The primate database is plagued by the use of measures that could be inappropriate for revealing hand preference, and by methodological inconsistencies between studies. We emphasise the need to standardise the methods to allow between studies and species comparisons. We propose that when referring to 'handedness' it is more appropriate to use the terms 'hand preference' and 'hand use', to avoid confusion with each disciplined own definition of handedness."
Task constraints mask great apes' ability to solve the trap-table task,"['Girndt, A', 'Meier, T', 'Call, J']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-ANIMAL BEHAVIOR PROCESSES,10.1037/0097-7403.34.1.54,JAN 2008,23,"Researchers have investigated animals' causal knowledge with a task requiring subjects to use a tool to bring a reward within reach whilst avoiding a trap. Previous studies have suggested limitations in the ability of several species to avoid traps in tubes or tables. However, certain features may have inflated task difficulty. We tested 20 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), 7 orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), 5 bonobos (Pan paniscus), and 5 gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) in the trap-table-a task in which subjects have to pull one of two rakes prepositioned behind two rewards on a flat surface. One of the rewards is in front of a trap into which it will fall. We investigated the effect of trap type, tool type, the number of available tools, and reinforcement regime on performance. We replicated previous findings showing that apes failed to choose the correct rake above chance. However, when they could instead choose where to insert a single tool, around 80% of the apes solved the trap-table task in the first trial, revealing an important effect of task constraints on their performance."
Ancient fossil specimens of extinct species are genetically more distant to an outgroup than extant sister species are.,"['Huang, Shi']",Rivista di biologia,NA,2008 Jan-Apr,2,"There exists a remarkable correlation between genetic distance as measured by protein or DNA dissimilarity and time of species divergence as inferred from fossil records. This observation has provoked the molecular clock hypothesis. However, data inconsistent with the hypothesis have steadily accumulated in recent years from studies of extant organisms. Here the published DNA and protein sequences from ancient fossil specimens were examined to see if they would support the molecular clock hypothesis. The hypothesis predicts that ancient specimens cannot be genetically more distant to an outgroup than extant sister species are. Also, two distinct ancient specimens cannot be genetically more distant than their extant sister species are. The findings here do not conform to these predictions. Neanderthals are more distant to chimpanzees and gorillas than modern humans are. Dinosaurs are more distant to frogs than extant birds are. Mastodons are more distant to opossums than other placental mammals are. The genetic distance between dinosaurs and mastodons is greater than that between extant birds and mammals. Therefore, while the molecular clock hypothesis is consistent with some data from extant organisms, it has yet to find support from ancient fossils. Far more damaging to the hypothesis than data from extant organisms, which merely question the constancy of mutation rate, the study of ancient fossil organisms here challenges for the first time the fundamental premise of modern evolution theory that genetic distances had always increased with time in the past history of life on Earth."
