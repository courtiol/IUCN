Isotopic Niche Variation in a Higher Trophic Level Ectotherm: Highlighting the Role of Succulent Plants in Desert Food Webs,"['Delibes, M', 'Blazquez, MC', 'Fedriani, JM', 'Granados, A', 'Soriano, L', 'Delgado, A']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0126814,MAY 14 2015,1,"Stable isotope analysis of animal tissues allows description of isotopic niches, whose axes in an n-dimensional space are the isotopic ratios, compared to a standard, of different isotope systems (e.g. delta C-13, delta N-15). Isotopic niches are informative about where an animal, population or species lives and about what it consumes. Here we describe inter-and intra-population isotopic niche (bidimensional delta C-13-delta N-15 space) of the Orange-throated whiptail (Aspidoscelis hyperythra), an arthropodivorous small lizard, in ten localities of Baja California Sur (Mexico). These localities range from extreme arid to subtropical conditions. Between 13 and 20 individuals were sampled at each locality and 1 cm of tail-tip was collected for isotope analysis. As expected, interpopulation niche width variation was much larger than intrapopulation one. Besides, isotopic variation was not related to age, sex or individual size of lizards. This suggests geographic variation of the isotopic niche was related to changes in the basal resources that fuel the trophic web at each locality. The position of Bayesian isotope ellipses in the delta-space indicated that whiptails in more arid localities were enriched in C-13, suggesting most of the carbon they ingested came from CAM succulent plants (cacti, agaves) and in minor degree in C-4 grasses. Contrarily, whiptails in subtropical areas were depleted in C-13, as they received more carbon from C-3 scrubs and trees. Localities closer to sea-level tended to be enriched in N-15, but a clear influence of marine subsidies was detected only at individual level. The study contributes to identify the origin and pathways through which energy flows across the trophic webs of North American deserts."
Type of soil and temperature range explain the preferred habitat and current distribution of the endemic lizard Aspidoscelis hyperythra in southern Baja California peninsula,"['Jacome-Flores, ME', 'Blazquez, MC', 'Sosa, VJ', 'Maya, Y']",JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS,10.1016/j.jaridenv.2014.10.008,FEB 2015,1,"The Baja California peninsula herpetofauna is composed by more than 160 species, many of them endemic. In the last years the region is experiencing an accelerating population growth and land use change, specially in the lowlands and coastal areas. Based on GLM models we described and predicted the distribution patterns of the regional endemic whiptail lizard, Aspidoscelis hyperythra Cope, 1863 (Sauna: Teiidae). We verified the accuracy of the predictive occurrence map in the field and then we generated a final suitable habitat model for the species. The soil characteristics have a great influence on occurrence probability. The highest values correspond to sandy areas with low slope, temperatures between 18 and 22 degrees C, annual range temperature below 15 degrees C, NDVI values ranged 0.60-0.73, rainfall between 200 and 400 mm, and altitude lower than 800 m. Vegetation was also important; the establishment of the species requires woody plants that produce (a) plant litter where the lizards find prey; (b) burrowing sites for clutches, daily shelter, or hibernation and (c) open areas with light shade available for effective thermoregulation. These areas where natural tropical deciduous forest and sarcocaulescent scrub are stablished are also the most attractive to human settlements; so the conflict between conservation and development is stronger there.

"Pattern of Differential Divergence Among Five Insular Species of the Aspidoscelis hyperythra Complex (Squamata: Teiidae), Baja California Sur, Mexico","['Taylor, HL', 'Walker, JM']",JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY,10.1670/13-050,SEP 2014,1,"The most recent taxonomic revision of the Aspidoscelis hyperythra complex of teiid lizards from Baja California referred all peninsular populations to A. hyperythra and recognized five insular populations as species based on their diagnosability and allopatric distributions. We used multivariate analyses of seven quantitative morphological characters to determine relative distinctiveness and divergence among these populations and the four geographically closest peninsular populations of A. hyperythra. The two northernmost insular species, Aspidoscelis picta (Isla Monserrate) and Aspidoscelis carmenensis (Isla Carmen) were significantly more divergent than were Aspidoscelis danheimae (Isla San Jose), Aspidoscelis franciscensis (Isla San Francisco), Aspidoscelis espiritensis (Islas Espiritu Santo and Partida Sur), and peninsular samples of A. hyperythra. Divergence information from mtDNA sequence variation divided the five insular species into the same high-divergence/low-divergence groups. We present new testable hypotheses relating to relative times of colonization and peninsular location of the source population of island colonists."
"PAN-PENINSULAR PATTERN OF MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATION IN ASPIDOSCELIS HYPERYTHRA (SQUAMATA: TEIIDAE), BAJA CALIFORNIA, MEXICO","['Taylor, HL', 'Walker, JM']",SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST,10.1894/F09-GC-234.1,JUN 2014,0,"Multivariate analyses of seven meristic characters from 257 specimens of Aspidoscelis hyperythra from Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, revealed pan-peninsular patterns of morphological variation. We observed a significant morphological shift between southern and northern populations at the Isthmus of La Paz, the location of a Pliocene trans-peninsular seaway that could have separated the two groups for a substantial length of time. However, we did not observe fixed character states, such as number of pale dorsal stripes, diagnostic of southern and northern populations. The co-occurrence in local populations of variable numbers of individuals with five, six, or seven stripes makes peninsular A. hyperythra an unusual member of the A. deppii species-group, where number of stripes is consistent in local populations. Samples from the Cape Region were statistically homogeneous based on the characters analyzed, but samples from the latitudinally expansive northern area revealed a pattern of similarities and significant differences unrelated to distances between localities."
Permeability of Roads to Movement of Scrubland Lizards and Small Mammals,"['Brehme, CS', 'Tracey, JA', 'McClenaghan, LR', 'Fisher, RN']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/cobi.12081,AUG 2013,13,"A primary objective of road ecology is to understand and predict how roads affect connectivity of wildlife populations. Road avoidance behavior can fragment populations, whereas lack of road avoidance can result in high mortality due to wildlife-vehicle collisions. Many small animal species focus their activities to particular microhabitats within their larger habitat. We sought to assess how different types of roads affect the movement of small vertebrates and to explore whether responses to roads may be predictable on the basis of animal life history or microhabitat preferences preferences. We tracked the movements of fluorescently marked animals at 24 sites distributed among 3 road types: low-use dirt, low-use secondary paved, and rural 2-lane highway. Most data we collected were on the San Diego pocket mouse (Chaetodipus fallax), cactus mouse (Peromyscus eremicus), western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis), orange-throated whiptail (Aspidoscelis hyperythra), Dulzura kangaroo rat (Dipodomys simulans) (dirt, secondary paved), and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) (highway only). San Diego pocket mice and cactus mice moved onto dirt roads but not onto a low-use paved road of similar width or onto the highway, indicating they avoid paved road substrate. Both lizard species moved onto the dirt and secondary paved roads but avoided the rural 2-lane rural highway, indicating they may avoid noise, vibration, or visual disturbance from a steady flow of traffic. Kangaroo rats did not avoid the dirt or secondary paved roads. Overall, dirt and secondary roads were more permeable to species that prefer to forage or bask in open areas of their habitat, rather than under the cover of rocks or shrubs. However, all study species avoided the rural 2-lane highway. Our results suggest that microhabitat use preferences and road substrate help predict species responses to low-use roads, but roads with heavy traffic may deter movement of a much wider range of small animal species."
Reptile and Amphibian Responses to Large-Scale Wildfires in Southern California,"['Rochester, CJ', 'Brehme, CS', 'Clark, DR', 'Stokes, DC', 'Hathaway, SA', 'Fisher, RN', 'HERPETOFAUNA']",JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY,NA,SEP 2010,18,"In 2003, southern California experienced several large fires that burned thousands of hectares of wildlife habitats and conserved lands. To investigate the effects of these fires on the reptile and amphibian communities, we compared the results from prefire herpetofauna and vegetation sampling to two years of postfire sampling across 38 burned and 17 unburned plots. The sampling plots were spread over four vegetation types and four open space areas within San Diego County. Our capture results indicated that burned chaparral and coastal sage scrub plots lost herpetofaunal species diversity after the fires and displayed a significant shift in overall community structure. Shrub and tree cover at the burned plots, averaged across the second and third postfire years, had decreased by 53% in chaparral and 75% in coastal sage scrub. Additionally, postfire herpetofauna community structure at burned plots was more similar to that found in unburned grasslands. In grassland and woodland/riparian vegetation plots, where shrub and tree cover was not significantly affected by fires, we found no differences in the herpetofaunal species diversity or community composition. At the individual species level, Sceloporus occidentalis was the most abundant reptile in these areas both before and after the fires. We saw increases in the net capture rates for several lizard species, including Aspidoscelis tigris, Phrynosoma coronatum, and Uta stansburiana in burned chaparral plots and Aspidoscelis hyperythra and U. stansburiana in burned coastal sage scrub plots. The toad, Bufo boreas, was detected at significantly fewer burned plots in chaparral after the fires. Additionally, we documented decreases in the number of plots occupied by lizards (Elgaria multicarinata), salamanders (Batrachoseps major), and snakes (Coluber constrictor, Lampropeltis getula, Pituophis catenifer, and Masticophis lateralis) in coastal sage scrub and chaparral after the fires. We discuss the individual species results as they relate to such life-history traits as the susceptibility to initial mortality, the response to the altered postfire habitat, and shifts in the availability of potential prey. We foresee that a continued unnatural fire regime will result in a simplification of the southern California reptile and amphibian communities."
