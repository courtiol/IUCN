1,5,Permeability of Roads to Movement of Scrubland Lizards and Small Mammals,"['Brehme, CS', 'Tracey, JA', 'McClenaghan, LR', 'Fisher, RN']",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,10.1111/cobi.12081,AUG 2013,12,"A primary objective of road ecology is to understand and predict how roads affect connectivity of wildlife populations. Road avoidance behavior can fragment populations, whereas lack of road avoidance can result in high mortality due to wildlife-vehicle collisions. Many small animal species focus their activities to particular microhabitats within their larger habitat. We sought to assess how different types of roads affect the movement of small vertebrates and to explore whether responses to roads may be predictable on the basis of animal life history or microhabitat preferences preferences. We tracked the movements of fluorescently marked animals at 24 sites distributed among 3 road types: low-use dirt, low-use secondary paved, and rural 2-lane highway. Most data we collected were on the San Diego pocket mouse (Chaetodipus fallax), cactus mouse (Peromyscus eremicus), western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis), orange-throated whiptail (Aspidoscelis hyperythra), Dulzura kangaroo rat (Dipodomys simulans) (dirt, secondary paved), and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) (highway only). San Diego pocket mice and cactus mice moved onto dirt roads but not onto a low-use paved road of similar width or onto the highway, indicating they avoid paved road substrate. Both lizard species moved onto the dirt and secondary paved roads but avoided the rural 2-lane rural highway, indicating they may avoid noise, vibration, or visual disturbance from a steady flow of traffic. Kangaroo rats did not avoid the dirt or secondary paved roads. Overall, dirt and secondary roads were more permeable to species that prefer to forage or bask in open areas of their habitat, rather than under the cover of rocks or shrubs. However, all study species avoided the rural 2-lane highway. Our results suggest that microhabitat use preferences and road substrate help predict species responses to low-use roads, but roads with heavy traffic may deter movement of a much wider range of small animal species."
1,6,Reptile and Amphibian Responses to Large-Scale Wildfires in Southern California,"['Rochester, CJ', 'Brehme, CS', 'Clark, DR', 'Stokes, DC', 'Hathaway, SA', 'Fisher, RN', 'HERPETOFAUNA']",JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY,NA,SEP 2010,18,"In 2003, southern California experienced several large fires that burned thousands of hectares of wildlife habitats and conserved lands. To investigate the effects of these fires on the reptile and amphibian communities, we compared the results from prefire herpetofauna and vegetation sampling to two years of postfire sampling across 38 burned and 17 unburned plots. The sampling plots were spread over four vegetation types and four open space areas within San Diego County. Our capture results indicated that burned chaparral and coastal sage scrub plots lost herpetofaunal species diversity after the fires and displayed a significant shift in overall community structure. Shrub and tree cover at the burned plots, averaged across the second and third postfire years, had decreased by 53% in chaparral and 75% in coastal sage scrub. Additionally, postfire herpetofauna community structure at burned plots was more similar to that found in unburned grasslands. In grassland and woodland/riparian vegetation plots, where shrub and tree cover was not significantly affected by fires, we found no differences in the herpetofaunal species diversity or community composition. At the individual species level, Sceloporus occidentalis was the most abundant reptile in these areas both before and after the fires. We saw increases in the net capture rates for several lizard species, including Aspidoscelis tigris, Phrynosoma coronatum, and Uta stansburiana in burned chaparral plots and Aspidoscelis hyperythra and U. stansburiana in burned coastal sage scrub plots. The toad, Bufo boreas, was detected at significantly fewer burned plots in chaparral after the fires. Additionally, we documented decreases in the number of plots occupied by lizards (Elgaria multicarinata), salamanders (Batrachoseps major), and snakes (Coluber constrictor, Lampropeltis getula, Pituophis catenifer, and Masticophis lateralis) in coastal sage scrub and chaparral after the fires. We discuss the individual species results as they relate to such life-history traits as the susceptibility to initial mortality, the response to the altered postfire habitat, and shifts in the availability of potential prey. We foresee that a continued unnatural fire regime will result in a simplification of the southern California reptile and amphibian communities."

Our observations. comparisons, and bibliographical overview revealed only two Austroglanidae autapomorphies, namely: 1) the peculiarly shaped, posteriorly bifurcated sesamoid bone 1 of the suspensorium: and 2) the markedly broad fourth basibranchial. Another feature, the marked lateral bifurcation of the anterodorsolateral laminar projection of the sphenotic bone, may eventually constitute an additional austroglanidid autapomorphy, but, perhaps more reasonably, be a synapomorphic feature to support a close relationship between A. gilli and A. barnardi.

The same five species were identified throughout the deposits. Labeobarbus aeneus overwhelmingly dominates all the assemblages, but Labeo capensis and Austroglanis sclateri may have become more important during the Holocene.

Our results, based on 16S ribosomal DNA, cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer I (ITS1), support the monophyly of an African clade with two separate lineages (Biomphalaria pfeifferi/Biomphalaria camerunensis and the Nilotic species complex/Biomphalaria angulosa). Following the initial colonization of Africa, Biomphalaria spread towards the east where a later radiation occurred in the Lake Victoria basin and the Albertine Rift Valley Lakes. With further dispersal along the River Nile, additional speciation took place giving origin to the North-east African species Biomphalaria alexandrina. Our results present almost no support of the species groups of Mandahl-Barth (except for the pfeifferi group), which is in accordance with other molecular appraisals. Our results suggest that Biomphalaria stanleyi, which is endemic to Lake Albert, is not an ecophenotype of the continental B. pfeifferi as previously suggested by other molecular studies.

The feasibility of CBWM based on meat cropping was therefore evaluated in New Dabaga/Ulangambi Forest Reserve (NDUFR). Comparison of relative wildlife densities with West Kilombero Scarp Forest Reserve, which is subject to only low hunting pressure, indicate that most relevant populations are severely depleted (Cephalophus monticola, C. harueyi and C. spadix, Potamochoerus larvatus) and hence that sustainable harvesting currently is not possible in NDUFR. Records of catch from hunters in the villages surrounding NDUFR indicate that bushmeat is of relatively low importance in terms of use and contribution to protein intake. Proximity to NDUFR and secondarily population size in the different villages is positively correlated with hunting intensity and depletion of wildlife. Comparisons between hunters and non-hunters in terms of wealth measures show that hunting is linked to poverty and low protein intake. An estimation of maximum sustainable harvest in NDUFR reveals that CBWM only has limited capacity to reduce these causes of hunting, maintain the communities' interest and offset the opportunity costs of conservation. Results of this study suggest that conservation efforts in NDUFR should focus on protecting wildlife against exploitation instead of encouraging use and dependence through CBWM. Supporting efforts should attempt to facilitate a complete shift to domestic sources of meat, by increasing the number of domestic animals in the poorest part of the population.

In contrast to the situation in the rest of its range, Abbott's duiker is relatively well documented and locally abundant in parts of the Udzungwa Mountains, which may now be the only stronghold for the species. We review the distribution of Abbott's duiker within the Udzungwa Mountains and present new information based on the non-invasive genetic identification of dung piles collected from the majority of forest blocks between 2006 and 2010 ( 73 confirmed dung samples). Our results include new records from outlying forest blocks where the presence of Abbott's duiker was previously unknown. Moreover, we present the first population-level analysis of genetic structure and diversity in this endangered species based on nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial sequence data. While these genetic results are limited due to small sample sizes, they indicate differentiation from other Abbott's duiker populations, as well as low genetic diversity relative to sympatric antelope species. Finally, we discuss threats to Abbott's duiker and identify broad trends within the differently managed Udzungwa Mountain forests, and elsewhere, that suggest potentially successful conservation strategies for this neglected species."

Dung counts have traditionally been used to infer forest antelope abundance but genetic identification has shown that visual identification of ungulate dung to species is often unreliable. This study attempted to use easily obtained morphometric data from faecal pellets to statistically assign antelope dung piles to species. We measured pellets from 238 dung piles collected from the Udzungwa Mountains, south-central Tanzania, a largely forested landscape with five forest-associated antelope species including the endangered Abbott's duiker Cephalophus spadix. The species identity of sampled dung piles was determined by amplifying a c. 600 bp fragment of the mitochondrial control region and aligning DNA sequences with published references. We found no diagnostic differences in faecal pellet size between antelope species although there were significant differences in mean pellet length and width. We employed a single variable linear discriminant analysis to predict the species of dung piles based on pellet length. Despite significant differentiation between species we obtained an overall accuracy of 58.8 % that did not meet our specified probability threshold (P < 0.05). Abbott's duiker dung piles were correctly assigned in the majority of cases (74 %). Overall, morphometric assignment of dung piles to species was not accurate enough to validate dung counts as a survey method for forest antelope although our results do not preclude the development of alternative field identification methods using additional non-molecular characters."

In contrast to the situation in the rest of its range, Abbott's duiker is relatively well documented and locally abundant in parts of the Udzungwa Mountains, which may now be the only stronghold for the species. We review the distribution of Abbott's duiker within the Udzungwa Mountains and present new information based on the non-invasive genetic identification of dung piles collected from the majority of forest blocks between 2006 and 2010 ( 73 confirmed dung samples). Our results include new records from outlying forest blocks where the presence of Abbott's duiker was previously unknown. Moreover, we present the first population-level analysis of genetic structure and diversity in this endangered species based on nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial sequence data. While these genetic results are limited due to small sample sizes, they indicate differentiation from other Abbott's duiker populations, as well as low genetic diversity relative to sympatric antelope species. Finally, we discuss threats to Abbott's duiker and identify broad trends within the differently managed Udzungwa Mountain forests, and elsewhere, that suggest potentially successful conservation strategies for this neglected species."
1,2,Can molecular data validate morphometric identification of faecal pellets in Tanzanian forest antelope species?,"['Bowkett, AE', 'Jones, T', 'Laizzer, RL', 'Plowman, AB', 'Stevens, JR']",CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES,10.1007/s12686-013-9935-3,DEC 2013,4,"Forest-dwelling antelope species are often difficult to detect during surveys due to their cryptic behaviour and densely vegetated habitats. Dung counts have traditionally been used to infer forest antelope abundance but genetic identification has shown that visual identification of ungulate dung to species is often unreliable. This study attempted to use easily obtained morphometric data from faecal pellets to statistically assign antelope dung piles to species. We measured pellets from 238 dung piles collected from the Udzungwa Mountains, south-central Tanzania, a largely forested landscape with five forest-associated antelope species including the endangered Abbott's duiker Cephalophus spadix. The species identity of sampled dung piles was determined by amplifying a c. 600 bp fragment of the mitochondrial control region and aligning DNA sequences with published references. We found no diagnostic differences in faecal pellet size between antelope species although there were significant differences in mean pellet length and width. We employed a single variable linear discriminant analysis to predict the species of dung piles based on pellet length. Despite significant differentiation between species we obtained an overall accuracy of 58.8 % that did not meet our specified probability threshold (P < 0.05). Abbott's duiker dung piles were correctly assigned in the majority of cases (74 %). Overall, morphometric assignment of dung piles to species was not accurate enough to validate dung counts as a survey method for forest antelope although our results do not preclude the development of alternative field identification methods using additional non-molecular characters."

We hypothesized that there is species specific variation among understorey saplings in the magnitude of photoinhibition in response to gap creation, which is related to their requirement for overstorey disturbance. Eleven more or less circular gaps were created varying in size from 60 up to 1459 m(2). Photoinhibition was assessed by determining predawn and midday F-v/F-m using chlorophyll fluorescence at two occasions during the first 3 weeks after creation of the gaps. The light environment was assessed using hemispherical photography. Five species that occurred in sufficient numbers in the understorey after gap creation were measured. They all showed an increase of photoinhibition with increasing gap size. Variation in exposure to direct sunlight within gaps contributed also to variation in photoinhibition. Dynamic photoinhibition, the overnight increase in F-v/F-m, was about 20% of total photoinhibition as measured at midday. The species responded quantitatively different. Oxandra asbeckii was most sensitive as evident from a decrease of predawn F-v/F-m from 0.79 in the understorey of undisturbed forest to 0.70 in the smallest and further to 0.41 in the largest gaps.

The decline of the population was not only detectable in the harvested size classes (>30 cm) but also among the smaller size classes. In 1999, however, Greenheart still ranked third in abundance. There was little change in the overall species composition, proportion of disperser groups or proportion of functional groups in the tree community. There were also no detectable changes in tree diversity. The conservation value of these unique forests can still be considered high. Thus, while the long-term sustainability of Greenheart harvesting is low, other ecological criteria of sustainability are met. Short-term recovery of Greenheart is not to be expected due to low population growth and small numbers of seed trees.

Species of the white pine group (Pinus spp.) and the white oak group (Quercus spp.) grow in North America, greenheart (Chlorocardium rodiei) is native to Guyana and Suriname in South America, and bulletwood (Manilkara spp.) is native to the Neotropics, including the Antilles. These data corroborate empirically the importation of timber products into the colonial British West Indies, a trade that had been studied mainly by historians working from documents. Our analysis of the current body of knowledge about human-induced modification of Barbuda's native vegetation concludes that the vegetation has been modified more profoundly by the island's historic and modern inhabitants, whose occupation is brief compared to the preceding 3,500-year span of Amerindian occupation."
1,4,Spatial and temporal patterns of seed attack and germination in a large-seeded neotropical tree species,"['Hammond, DS', 'Brown, VK', 'Zagt, R']",OECOLOGIA,10.1007/s004420050778,MAY 1999,20,"It has long been argued that seed dispersal enhances recruitment in tropical trees by allowing offspring to 'escape' strong density/distance-dependent attack by insects, pathogens and rodents. Here we examined the effects of canopy openness and parent-offspring distance upon the frequency and timing of Chlorocardium rodiei seed attack and germination within a 15-ha plot of Guyanan tropical rain forest. Seeds were artificially dispersed beneath parent tries, in the understorey away from trees and in gaps. Analysing our data from an 85-week period of regular monitoring, we found that the main spatial gradients, canopy openness and distance to nearest adult conspecific, do not lead to differences in the final number of seeds attacked by infesting scolytid beetles or rodents, The timing of beetle attack, however, varied along the distance gradient and this difference affords seeds at further distances a 'window' in which to germinate and produce a seedling before attack. Canopy openness was not a good predictor of rooting success, but distance was strongly associated with root and shoot formation success and the mean time to shoot formation. There was a strong negative effect of distance on the likelihood of a seed being colonised by scolytid beetles prior to removal by rodents and shoot failure was strongly associated with prior infestation. We believe these results bring a key point to bear on the well-established notion of distance-dependent attack on seeds in tropical rainforests, viz. that seed characteristics (size, germination syndrome) and the timing of attack may be more important in explaining patterns of early seedling recruitment than distance. Our studies suggest that advantages accrued through dispersal in species like Chlorocardium will depend heavily on the 'race' between seed germination and attack. In the case of Chlorocardium, the 'race' can be lost at considerable distances due to its prolonged dormancy and the temporal fluctuations in fruitfall and rainfall which influence attack and germination. The results presented here suggest that the lag between seed attack and germination in tropical trees can regulate the influence of parent-offspring distance on cohort recruitment at this life history stage."

Differently aged sprout populations on cut stumps were surveyed to determine the numbers of sprouts produced, probability of survival and growth rates. Fifty-five to 70% of the stumps produced sprouts. The proportion of stumps that sprouted was lower for the hollow stumps than for the intact ones and the number of sprouts produced per stump was reduced. No significant correlation was found between stump diameter and the number of sprouts. Some sprouts survived for at least 15 y (usually one per stump), and these had a significantly larger average diameter relative to the sprouts at younger sites. The number of sprouts and the diameter of the largest sprout showed a significant positive correlation, suggesting that the maintenance of the inherited stump root system is shared among the sprouts so that the costs per sprout are reduced. We conclude that sprouting on cut stumps may have the potential to contribute to the maintenance of C. rodiei in the canopy at logged sites."

1,6,Regeneration through sprout formation in Chlorocardium rodiei (Lauraceae) in Guyana,"['Rijks, MH', 'Malta, EJ', 'Zagt, RJ']",JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,10.1017/S0266467498000340,JUL 1998,6,"The contribution of sprouts to the long-term survival of Chlorocardium rodiei, following logging was investigated. Differently aged sprout populations on cut stumps were surveyed to determine the numbers of sprouts produced, probability of survival and growth rates. Fifty-five to 70% of the stumps produced sprouts. The proportion of stumps that sprouted was lower for the hollow stumps than for the intact ones and the number of sprouts produced per stump was reduced. No significant correlation was found between stump diameter and the number of sprouts. Some sprouts survived for at least 15 y (usually one per stump), and these had a significantly larger average diameter relative to the sprouts at younger sites. The number of sprouts and the diameter of the largest sprout showed a significant positive correlation, suggesting that the maintenance of the inherited stump root system is shared among the sprouts so that the costs per sprout are reduced. We conclude that sprouting on cut stumps may have the potential to contribute to the maintenance of C. rodiei in the canopy at logged sites."

The 13 species of Cinclodes formed a monophyletic group consisting of three major lineages: (1) the southeastern Brazilian isolate C. pabsti, which was sister to the rest of the genus; (2) a clade of five primarily Patagonian or central Argentine highlands species; and (3) a clade of seven primarily north-central Andean or Pacific species. Biogeographic structure in the Patagonian-Andean taxa was consistent with the deep Patagonian and north-central Andean division previously noted in the similarly distributed genus Muscisaxicola. Evolutionary relationships among Cinclodes species were partially consistent with expectations based on plumage, behavior, and ecology. The phenotypically distinctive C. antarcticus was found to be sister to the widespread C.fuscus in the primarily Patagonian-Argentine clade, and the distinctive C. palliatits to be sister to C. atacamensis in the high Andean-Pacific clade. The central Argentine isolates C. comechingonus and C. olrogi formed a clade with C. oustaleti (olrogi sister to oustaleti, and comechbigonus sister to those two) within the Patagonian-Argentine clade. The Pacific marine specialists C. nigrofumosus and C. taczamowskii were sisters within the Andean-Pacific clade and were distantly related to the southern maritime species C. antarcticus. Thus, marine ecological specialization apparently evolved twice within Cinclodes; behavioral and ecological data also support the nonhomology of the two character states. The two exclusively Pacific species were positionally apomorphic within the Andean-Pacific clade; ancestral area analysis indicated that the high Andes were the most likely area of origin for this clade, and that the Pacific coast was occupied secondarily."

The mean monthly densities of each species in each system were used ill the species matrix, and the mean monthly values of salinity, temperature and turbidity were used in the environmental matrix. The mean species diversity and evenness index were significantly higher in Durban Harbour(H' = 1.03, J' = 0.65) than in the other two systems. The cumulative dominance curve showed that St Lucia Estuary has a high dominance of a few species, with Richards Bay Harbour intermediate and Durban Harbour being the most diverse. Classification and MDS (multiple-dimensional scaling) analyses of larval fish densities in all three systems grouped together into three main clusters on the basis of system. The species similarity matrix (inverse analysis) clustered into five groups at the 25% similarity level. The MDS analysis of the same matrix showed that the groups separated out according to the degree of estuarine association of a species and hence habitat type. The species most responsible for system groupings were: Glossogobius callidus, Gilchristella aestuaria, Stolephorus holodon, Croilia mossambica and Gobiid 12. The ""best fitting"" of the environmental variables to explain the larval fish community patterns in each system was turbidity on its own (weighted Spearman's rank correlation, rho (w) = 0.55). The relationship of larval densities to environmental conditions was shown to be species-specific with estuarine species (e.g. G. callidus and G. aestuaria), having a strong positive correlation with temperature and turbidity but negative correlations with salinity. In summary, much longer term studies with more sites within each system are needed to assess whether the larval fish assemblages are stable or at an equilibrium (both spatially and temporally) and whether these assemblages are indicative of the relative ""health"" and nursery function of the system."

Our retrospective analysis revealed a number of analytical challenges for such comparisons that we describe. The number of lakes on which this species occurred does not appear to have declined significantly in the past three decades when a correction for survey duration was applied. The range-wide decline of 5.1%/yr based on Christmas Bird Count data would have resulted in 2006 occupancy at approximate to 5 lakes. We estimate that with correction this would have increased to approximate to 26. However, naive or unadjusted analyses with a Chi-squared test showed a significant decline. A simulated resampling of the historical data was performed using a repeatability factor of 62% that was derived from a subset of historical lakes that was visited twice in the 1970s. Only 8 of 13 lakes resurveyed had the same results on both historical visits. Our unadjusted 2006 results are a likely outcome, i.e., a 14.9% chance of finding this result, when this repeatability factor is considered, and the likelihood of no change is higher when our corrected data are considered. The possibility of double counting in the historical data further reduced the likelihood of a large decline in relative abundance. Therefore, Rusty Blackbird occurrence does not appear to have changed significantly in the past 33 yr in the Mackenzie Valley.

Recent research in New England, USA, suggests that an ecological trap, created through timber harvesting on the breeding grounds, may be responsible. Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were hypothesized to be the primary nest predator, but definitive identification was lacking. The potential for mast cone crops to affect Rusty Blackbird nest predation via trophic interactions also remains unexamined. Our objectives were to identify the mechanisms by which an ecological trap may be operating in New England through a multiscale analysis of Rusty Blackbird habitat selection and nest survival, as well as predator identification and quantification. We located 72 Rusty Blackbird nests in Maine and New Hampshire in 2011 and 2012, and modeled habitat selection and nest survival as a function of habitat characteristics at the nest patch (5 m) and home range (500 m) scale. We placed camera traps at 29 nests to identify nest predators, and conducted ground surveys to obtain an index of squirrel abundance each year. We found that Rusty Blackbirds selected nest patches with a high basal area of small conifers and low canopy closure. Nest survival was not reduced in harvested stands, but increased with increasing basal area. Percent cover of wetlands and young softwood stands were the best predictors of Rusty Blackbird selection at the home range scale. At the home range scale, we found that nests that were closer to a road were less successful in 2011, but not in 2012. Red squirrels were the most frequent predator of Rusty Blackbird nests in 2012, when they were abundant following a mast year in 2011. These results suggest that dense cover of small softwoods is important for habitat selection and survival of Rusty Blackbird nests, and that precommercial thinning and possibly road-building could reduce habitat quality for this species."

Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) is a forested wetland specialist wintering in bottomland hardwood forests in the south-eastern U.S. and belongs to the most steeply declining songbirds in the U.S. Little information is available to support priority birds such as the Rusty Blackbird wintering in this threatened habitat. We assessed age and sex distribution and body condition of Rusty Blackbirds among the three major habitats used by this species in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley and also measured food availability. Overall, pecan groves had the highest biomass mainly driven by the amount of nuts. Invertebrate biomass was highest in forests but contributed only a small percentage to overall biomass. Age and sex classes were unevenly distributed among habitats with adult males primarily occupying pecan groves containing the highest nut biomass, females being found in forests which had the lowest nut biomass and young males primarily staying in forest fragments along creeks which had intermediate nut biomass. Males were in better body condition than females and were in slightly better condition in pecan groves. The results suggest that adult males occupy the highest quality habitat and may competitively exclude the other age and sex classes."

We modeled occupancy and detectability as a function of site (i.e. habitat-based) and sampling (i.e. visit-specific) variables collected at 546 wetlands in northern New England, USA. Wetland occupancy (mean +/- SE = 0.07 +/- 0.02 in randomly selected wetlands, and 0.12 +/- 0.02 in all wetlands surveyed) was best explained by variables describing Rusty Blackbird foraging habitat (PUDDLES: a proxy for shallow water), nesting habitat (coniferous adjacent uplands), and evidence of beavers. In contrast to Rusty Blackbirds' selection of pole-stage conifers at the nest-site scale, stand age did not affect occupancy at the wetland scale. It appears that most wetlands in northern coniferous forest landscapes, regardless of stand age, offer dense conifer patches nearby and provide suitable breeding habitat if quality foraging sites (e.g., areas of shallow water) also are available. Detectability (0.29 +/- 0.04) decreased with increasing wind speed, and decreased about fourfold over the course of the breeding season. Rusty Blackbirds responded to broadcast of conspecific vocalizations by flying toward the observer and perching more often than prior to broadcast, demonstrating that broadcasts can be a useful tool to enhance visual detectability. Given our results, observers can now focus site selection on wetlands and sampling conditions most likely to maximize detections of Rusty Blackbirds."

Birds took similar Central Flyway routes on southward and northward migrations, which were not previously described for this species. The birds used a series of stopover sites across the prairie region from southern Saskatchewan to Iowa over a 4 to 5 week period on their southward migration to wintering areas that spanned from South Dakota to northern Louisiana.

We used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey and regional and global climate indices to examine the effects of climate change on the breeding distribution of the Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus), a formerly common species that is rapidly declining. We found that the range of the Rusty Blackbird retracted northward by 143 km since the 1960s and that the probability of local extinction was highest at the southern range margin. Furthermore, we found that the mean breeding latitude of the Rusty Blackbird was significant and positively correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation with a lag of six years. Because the annual distribution of the Rusty Blackbird is affected by annual weather patterns produced by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, our results support the hypothesis that directional climate change over the past 40 years is contributing to the decline of the Rusty Blackbird. Our study is the first to implicate climate change, acting through range retraction, in a major decline of a formerly common bird species."

We analyzed data from 15 y of fall migration monitoring at the Observatoire d'oiseaux de Tadoussac (OOT), located at the mouth of the Saguenay River on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River estuary in Quebec, Canada. The trend observed suggest an ongoing decline. Numbers of rusty blackbirds varied considerably between years, with peak movements occurring at 5-y intervals and possibly reflecting high reproductive success for those years. The numbers of adult boreal owls caught and banded at the OOT, and the proportion of juveniles, were negatively and positively correlated with rusty blackbird numbers, respectively. Peaks in rusty blackbird abundance occurred when red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi) were abundant in the eastern boreal forest. Also, rusty blackbird numbers were positively correlated to the annual and winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices and negatively to the combined precipitation for June, July, and August, suggesting that environmental factors may have contributed both directly and indirectly (through food web processes) to the cyclic variations in abundance observed. Current declines may be exacerbated by NAO fluctuation patterns, that is, more frequent negative indices may negatively affect reproductive success and possibly winter survival."
1,7,SPECIAL SECTION: RANGEWIDE ECOLOGY OF THE DECLINING RUSTY BLACKBIRD RUSTY BLACKBIRD: MYSTERIES OF A SPECIES IN DECLINE,"['Greenberg, R', 'Matsuoka, SM']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100153,NOV 2010,11,"The Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) breeds across the boreal forest zone of North America and winters throughout the eastern United States. Over the past four decades, the North American Breeding Bird Survey and the Christmas Bird Count have shown high rates of population decline ranging from approximately 5 to 12% per year. Regional surveys suggest declines and range retractions in the southern boreal zone. Analyses of historical accounts suggest that the Rusty Blackbird's abundance has been dropping steadily for over a century. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the decline. The species relies on wooded wetlands throughout the year, so loss and degradation of these habitats-particularly in the winter range-is a prime suspect. Blackbird-control programs may have contributed. In recent decades, habitat disturbance, global warming, and environmental contamination in the boreal zone may have taken their toll on breeding populations. In 2005, the International Rusty Blackbird Working Group was formed to develop research efforts toward understanding the mysterious decline. This special section presents the group's research findings-the first on the species' use of breeding and winter habitat, reproductive success, parasite prevalence, patterns of molt, and migratory connectivity. Data on the levels of methylmercury in tissues and the role of timber management on reproductive success are intriguing. We outline research needed for assessment of the roles of various factors in causing the decline of the Rusty Blackbird."

We measured ratios of stable hydrogen isotopes (delta D) in feathers collected from Rusty Blackbirds wintering in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (n = 255 birds) and the coastal plain of South Carolina and Virginia (n = 281 birds), 2005-2009, to estimate the region of origin of birds wintering west and east of the Appalachians, respectively. We also measured delta D values in feathers from all available museum specimens collected from 1879 to 1990 in these same two regions (n = 190 birds). Isotopic values support migratory connectivity in this species with breeding populations in the western and central boreal forest migrating through a central or Mississippi flyway and those breeding in the eastern boreal forest migrating to a winter range east of the Appalachians. We detected little long-term change in the breeding origins of modern and historical populations wintering east and west of the Appalachians. However, we found short-term temporal variability in the breeding origins of birds wintering on the coastal plain from 2007 to 2009. The migratory divide suggests that efforts at management should be tailored to at least eastern and western subpopulations on both the breeding and wintering grounds. Our approach can be applied to a broad range of migratory species in North America and on other continents."

The Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) breeds in boreal wetlands and has declined by 85-95% over the last half century. We studied nest-site selection and daily nest-survival rate (DSR) of 43 Rusty Blackbird nests in northern New England and evaluated whether regenerating logged areas adjacent to wetlands created ecological traps. Although nesting adults avoided high-canopied forests and selected areas with dense balsam fir (Abies balasmea) I to 3 m high, those characteristics were not associated with DSR. Conversely, the frequency of speckled alder (Alnus incana) and sedges (Cyperaceae) in the nest plot varied with DSR, suggesting that the risk of predation of nests within wetlands was lower. DSR also varied with past logging; nests in plots not harvested recently were 2.3x more likely to fledge young than nests in plots harvested within 20 years. When logging extends to the edges of or into wetlands, the subsequent dense regenerating conifers appear to attract Rusty Blackbirds to nest closer to or within these human-altered uplands, exposing their nests to increased predation not typical of unaltered wetlands. Three surrogates for habitat preference did not differ by timber-management history, suggesting that the birds do not prefer habitats that increase their fitness. Rusty Blackbirds nesting in harvested wetlands may be subject to ""equal preference"" ecological traps, and we suggest that buffers 75 m wide around the perimeter of suitable wetlands should increase DSR."

In coastal Alaska and throughout Canada, nests were primarily in conifers (85% of 212 nests). All conifer nests in Alaska and 80% of those in Canada were placed in spruce (Picea spp.), primarily black spruce (P. mariana). In Alaska use of small spruces (<8 cm dbh) was selective and resulted in high reproductive success-nest survival increased with black spruce density, and success of nests in spruce (79%) was higher than that of nests in deciduous vegetation (52%). Survival of nests in taller spruce declined, possibly from predation by red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). Rusty Blackbirds nested near water in interior (<(x)over bar> = 8 m) and south-central Alaska ((x) over bar = 30 m), and small spruces near water appear to be important over much of the species' range. In interior Alaska, however, most nests were in willows (78%), which dominated the vegetation near water. Nest success in Alaska averaged 56%, similar to rates over the same period in New England but higher than those of other North American blackbirds (30-39%). Studies are needed to verify whether nest survival is also high in Canada and to investigate where and why deficits in survival of adults or juveniles may be limiting population growth."
1,11,ESTIMATING THE ABUNDANCE OF NESTING RUSTY BLACKBIRDS IN RELATION TO WETLAND HABITATS IN ALASKA,"['Matsuoka, SM', 'Shaw, D', 'Johnson, JA']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100148,NOV 2010,5,"We used double sampling to estimate densities of Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) nests among boreal wetlands in Anchorage and Tanana Flats, Alaska, 2007-2008. We also assessed habitat selection by examining the number and location of nests relative to the availability of various wetland types. We rapidly surveyed 78 sample units for adult Rusty Blackbirds and intensively searched for nests in a subset of 55 units to determine actual numbers of nests. Rapid surveys detected 97% of the 75 nests when we restricted counts to pairs and lone females. They overestimated nest numbers by 17% when we included in the counts lone males, which sometimes made long flights within and between sample units. Nest densities in sampled wetlands averaged 2.2 and 3.4 nests km(-2) in Anchorage and Tanana Flats, respectively, surprisingly similar despite wetlands being rare in Anchorage. An abundance of wetlands made identifying important breeding habitats difficult on the Tanana Flats, where blackbirds used most wetland types in relation to their availability and avoided wetlands with low shrubs. Habitat selection was clearer in Anchorage, where ponds, lakes, and wetlands with emergent vegetation were positive predictors of nest abundance. In this area blackbirds also selected forested wetlands and avoided upland habitats for nest sites. An affinity for open water has been noted throughout the Rusty Blackbird's breeding range. Research is needed to understand whether this affinity is due to specialized food requirements and to assess whether this species is vulnerable to widespread drying of wetlands across boreal Alaska."
1,12,HOME RANGES OF RUSTY BLACKBIRDS BREEDING IN WETLANDS: HOW MUCH WOULD BUFFERS FROM TIMBER HARVEST PROTECT HABITAT?,"['Powell, LL', 'Hodgman, TP', 'Glanz, WE']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100151,NOV 2010,5,"We calculated the home ranges and core areas of 13 adult Rusty Blackbirds (Euphagus carolinus) in Maine to determine (1) the area requirements of breeding adults, (2) whether area requirements of the sexes and of colonial and noncolonial individuals differ, and (3) the proportion of the home range and core area that would be protected by a buffer of no logging of 50-100 m around occupied wetlands. Mean home ranges (37.5 +/- 12.6 ha) and core areas (11.1 +/- 2.8 ha) were large in comparison to those of other breeding icterids, and adults often foraged in multiple unconnected wetlands. Rusty Blackbirds that were part of a loose colony had home ranges and core areas three times larger than those of pairs that nested solitarily, which we speculate may be due to adults following one other to feed on unpredictable emergences of aquatic insects. Home ranges and core areas included a surprisingly small amount of wetland habitat, only 12% and 19% respectively, but adults often foraged in small wet patches (<16 m(2)) in otherwise upland habitat. The 75-m buffers around wetlands that we recommended in a concurrent study may help protect the Rusty Blackbird's nesting habitat, but such buffers contained less than half the average home range, suggesting that they may be of only limited benefit as a conservation strategy for protecting foraging habitat."

Because its habitat use during the nonbreeding season had not been quantified, we estimated occupancy rates of Rusty Blackbirds wintering in the lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley in relation to habitat type (four types of bottomland forest and adjacent agricultural fields), tree density, canopy cover, and water cover. In January and February, we surveyed 89 sites eight times during 2006, 117 and 109 sites 10 times during 2007 and 2008, respectively. Occupancy of individual birds, estimated from their presence or absence at a site, was generally high and greater in 2006 (0.71) than during either 2007 (0.43) or 2008 (0.37). Occupancy of flocks, estimated from presence or absence of >= 20 individuals, was highest in 2006 (0.46), lowest in 2007 (0.17), and intermediate in 2008 (0.30), possibly because of water levels fluctuating from year to year. Rusty Blackbirds were not as specialized in habitat use as expected; habitat characteristics did not consistently predict occupancy of either individuals or flocks. Occupancy of individuals increased with canopy cover during 2007, and occupancy of flocks decreased with tree density during 2006. In 2008, occupancy of individuals increased with tree density and was higher in wet bottomland forest (0.51) than in other habitats (0.31-0.35). Further research is needed to determine whether this lack of habitat specificity is widespread and possibly the result of diverse food requirements during the nonbreeding season."

We investigated patterns of prebasic molt of the Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) in fall at Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, and developed a new technique for aging based on characteristics of the head plumage acquired during prebasic molt. Furthermore, we investigated the possibility of a prealternate molt among wintering Rusty Blackbirds on the basis of captures in Mississippi and museum specimens from across the species' winter range. Finally, we examined how a prealternate molt might affect the aging of winter birds by plumage. Rusty Blackbirds completed their prebasic molt by the end of September, and immature birds had a more prominent eye ring and a paler chin than adults, allowing a reliable age determination. Previously, the Rusty Blackbird was thought to attain its breeding plumage through feather wear exclusively, but we discovered a partial prealternate molt in our examinations of live captures (76% molting) and museum specimens (59% molting). The prealternate molt was observed in all age and sex classes, was concentrated along the feather tracts of the head, and peaked in occurrence from mid-February to mid-March, when nearly 90% of birds were molting. Between mid-December and mid-February, the prealternate molt did not appear to interfere with aging birds in the hand by the pattern of the eye ring and chin in basic plumage. Age determination later in the spring, however, remains to be investigated."

We examined mercury concentrations in blood and feathers from the wetland obligate and rapidly declining Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) from five regions across North America: three wintering areas in the contiguous United States and breeding areas in the western boreal forests of Alaska and the Acadian forests of northeastern North America. In blood, mercury concentrations in Rusty Blackbirds from the Acadian forest (geometric mean 0.94 mu g g(-1); n = 59) were >3x than in those from Alaska (0.26 mu g g(-1); 107). Wintering birds had blood mercury levels approximately an order of magnitude lower than those of breeding birds (0.07 mu g g(-1); 332). In feathers, mercury concentrations in samples from the Acadian forests exceeded published minimum levels for adverse effects on birds (8.26 mu g g(-1); 45) and were 3x to 7x those observed from the other regions. The mercury concentrations we report in blood and feathers of the Acadian forest population of the Rusty Blackbird are among the highest reported for wild populations of passerines at sites without a known local source of mercury. Mercury should be considered as a potential contributor to the species' dramatic population decline in New England and the Maritime provinces and in other areas where bioavailability of mercury is high."

These nests were located within a 70-ha clearcut dominated by regenerating Picea rubens (Red Spruce), P mariana (Black Spruce), and Ales balsamea (Balsam Fir). Within 1500 m of the core colony, we located two ""satellite"" nests in young forests regenerating from heavy partial harvests. We observed mobbing behavior by multiple individuals from different pairs, suggesting that coloniality in this species may be an antipredator strategy."

Recent research in New England, USA, suggests that an ecological trap, created through timber harvesting on the breeding grounds, may be responsible. Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were hypothesized to be the primary nest predator, but definitive identification was lacking. The potential for mast cone crops to affect Rusty Blackbird nest predation via trophic interactions also remains unexamined. Our objectives were to identify the mechanisms by which an ecological trap may be operating in New England through a multiscale analysis of Rusty Blackbird habitat selection and nest survival, as well as predator identification and quantification. We located 72 Rusty Blackbird nests in Maine and New Hampshire in 2011 and 2012, and modeled habitat selection and nest survival as a function of habitat characteristics at the nest patch (5 m) and home range (500 m) scale. We placed camera traps at 29 nests to identify nest predators, and conducted ground surveys to obtain an index of squirrel abundance each year. We found that Rusty Blackbirds selected nest patches with a high basal area of small conifers and low canopy closure. Nest survival was not reduced in harvested stands, but increased with increasing basal area. Percent cover of wetlands and young softwood stands were the best predictors of Rusty Blackbird selection at the home range scale. At the home range scale, we found that nests that were closer to a road were less successful in 2011, but not in 2012. Red squirrels were the most frequent predator of Rusty Blackbird nests in 2012, when they were abundant following a mast year in 2011. These results suggest that dense cover of small softwoods is important for habitat selection and survival of Rusty Blackbird nests, and that precommercial thinning and possibly road-building could reduce habitat quality for this species."

Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) is a forested wetland specialist wintering in bottomland hardwood forests in the south-eastern U.S. and belongs to the most steeply declining songbirds in the U.S. Little information is available to support priority birds such as the Rusty Blackbird wintering in this threatened habitat. We assessed age and sex distribution and body condition of Rusty Blackbirds among the three major habitats used by this species in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley and also measured food availability. Overall, pecan groves had the highest biomass mainly driven by the amount of nuts. Invertebrate biomass was highest in forests but contributed only a small percentage to overall biomass. Age and sex classes were unevenly distributed among habitats with adult males primarily occupying pecan groves containing the highest nut biomass, females being found in forests which had the lowest nut biomass and young males primarily staying in forest fragments along creeks which had intermediate nut biomass. Males were in better body condition than females and were in slightly better condition in pecan groves. The results suggest that adult males occupy the highest quality habitat and may competitively exclude the other age and sex classes."

1,7,SPECIAL SECTION: RANGEWIDE ECOLOGY OF THE DECLINING RUSTY BLACKBIRD RUSTY BLACKBIRD: MYSTERIES OF A SPECIES IN DECLINE,"['Greenberg, R', 'Matsuoka, SM']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100153,NOV 2010,11,"The Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) breeds across the boreal forest zone of North America and winters throughout the eastern United States. Over the past four decades, the North American Breeding Bird Survey and the Christmas Bird Count have shown high rates of population decline ranging from approximately 5 to 12% per year. Regional surveys suggest declines and range retractions in the southern boreal zone. Analyses of historical accounts suggest that the Rusty Blackbird's abundance has been dropping steadily for over a century. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the decline. The species relies on wooded wetlands throughout the year, so loss and degradation of these habitats-particularly in the winter range-is a prime suspect. Blackbird-control programs may have contributed. In recent decades, habitat disturbance, global warming, and environmental contamination in the boreal zone may have taken their toll on breeding populations. In 2005, the International Rusty Blackbird Working Group was formed to develop research efforts toward understanding the mysterious decline. This special section presents the group's research findings-the first on the species' use of breeding and winter habitat, reproductive success, parasite prevalence, patterns of molt, and migratory connectivity. Data on the levels of methylmercury in tissues and the role of timber management on reproductive success are intriguing. We outline research needed for assessment of the roles of various factors in causing the decline of the Rusty Blackbird."
1,8,MIGRATORY CONNECTIVITY IN THE RUSTY BLACKBIRD: ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE FROM FEATHERS OF HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY SPECIMENS,"['Hobson, KA', 'Greenberg, R', 'Van Wilgenburg, SL', 'Mettke-Hofmann, C']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100146,NOV 2010,15,"The Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) has declined dramatically across its range in North America since at least the 1960s, but the causes for this decline are unknown. We measured ratios of stable hydrogen isotopes (delta D) in feathers collected from Rusty Blackbirds wintering in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (n = 255 birds) and the coastal plain of South Carolina and Virginia (n = 281 birds), 2005-2009, to estimate the region of origin of birds wintering west and east of the Appalachians, respectively. We also measured delta D values in feathers from all available museum specimens collected from 1879 to 1990 in these same two regions (n = 190 birds). Isotopic values support migratory connectivity in this species with breeding populations in the western and central boreal forest migrating through a central or Mississippi flyway and those breeding in the eastern boreal forest migrating to a winter range east of the Appalachians. We detected little long-term change in the breeding origins of modern and historical populations wintering east and west of the Appalachians. However, we found short-term temporal variability in the breeding origins of birds wintering on the coastal plain from 2007 to 2009. The migratory divide suggests that efforts at management should be tailored to at least eastern and western subpopulations on both the breeding and wintering grounds. Our approach can be applied to a broad range of migratory species in North America and on other continents."
1,9,NEST-SITE SELECTION AND NEST SURVIVAL OF THE RUSTY BLACKBIRD: DOES TIMBER MANAGEMENT ADJACENT TO WETLANDS CREATE ECOLOGICAL TRAPS?,"['Powell, LL', 'Hodgman, TP', 'Glanz, WE', 'Osenton, JD', 'Fisher, CM']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100152,NOV 2010,15,"Animals are subject to ecological traps when anthropogenic changes create habitat that appears suitable but when selected results in decreased fitness. The Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) breeds in boreal wetlands and has declined by 85-95% over the last half century. We studied nest-site selection and daily nest-survival rate (DSR) of 43 Rusty Blackbird nests in northern New England and evaluated whether regenerating logged areas adjacent to wetlands created ecological traps. Although nesting adults avoided high-canopied forests and selected areas with dense balsam fir (Abies balasmea) I to 3 m high, those characteristics were not associated with DSR. Conversely, the frequency of speckled alder (Alnus incana) and sedges (Cyperaceae) in the nest plot varied with DSR, suggesting that the risk of predation of nests within wetlands was lower. DSR also varied with past logging; nests in plots not harvested recently were 2.3x more likely to fledge young than nests in plots harvested within 20 years. When logging extends to the edges of or into wetlands, the subsequent dense regenerating conifers appear to attract Rusty Blackbirds to nest closer to or within these human-altered uplands, exposing their nests to increased predation not typical of unaltered wetlands. Three surrogates for habitat preference did not differ by timber-management history, suggesting that the birds do not prefer habitats that increase their fitness. Rusty Blackbirds nesting in harvested wetlands may be subject to ""equal preference"" ecological traps, and we suggest that buffers 75 m wide around the perimeter of suitable wetlands should increase DSR."

In coastal Alaska and throughout Canada, nests were primarily in conifers (85% of 212 nests). All conifer nests in Alaska and 80% of those in Canada were placed in spruce (Picea spp.), primarily black spruce (P. mariana). In Alaska use of small spruces (<8 cm dbh) was selective and resulted in high reproductive success-nest survival increased with black spruce density, and success of nests in spruce (79%) was higher than that of nests in deciduous vegetation (52%). Survival of nests in taller spruce declined, possibly from predation by red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). Rusty Blackbirds nested near water in interior (<(x)over bar> = 8 m) and south-central Alaska ((x) over bar = 30 m), and small spruces near water appear to be important over much of the species' range. In interior Alaska, however, most nests were in willows (78%), which dominated the vegetation near water. Nest success in Alaska averaged 56%, similar to rates over the same period in New England but higher than those of other North American blackbirds (30-39%). Studies are needed to verify whether nest survival is also high in Canada and to investigate where and why deficits in survival of adults or juveniles may be limiting population growth."
1,11,ESTIMATING THE ABUNDANCE OF NESTING RUSTY BLACKBIRDS IN RELATION TO WETLAND HABITATS IN ALASKA,"['Matsuoka, SM', 'Shaw, D', 'Johnson, JA']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100148,NOV 2010,5,"We used double sampling to estimate densities of Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) nests among boreal wetlands in Anchorage and Tanana Flats, Alaska, 2007-2008. We also assessed habitat selection by examining the number and location of nests relative to the availability of various wetland types. We rapidly surveyed 78 sample units for adult Rusty Blackbirds and intensively searched for nests in a subset of 55 units to determine actual numbers of nests. Rapid surveys detected 97% of the 75 nests when we restricted counts to pairs and lone females. They overestimated nest numbers by 17% when we included in the counts lone males, which sometimes made long flights within and between sample units. Nest densities in sampled wetlands averaged 2.2 and 3.4 nests km(-2) in Anchorage and Tanana Flats, respectively, surprisingly similar despite wetlands being rare in Anchorage. An abundance of wetlands made identifying important breeding habitats difficult on the Tanana Flats, where blackbirds used most wetland types in relation to their availability and avoided wetlands with low shrubs. Habitat selection was clearer in Anchorage, where ponds, lakes, and wetlands with emergent vegetation were positive predictors of nest abundance. In this area blackbirds also selected forested wetlands and avoided upland habitats for nest sites. An affinity for open water has been noted throughout the Rusty Blackbird's breeding range. Research is needed to understand whether this affinity is due to specialized food requirements and to assess whether this species is vulnerable to widespread drying of wetlands across boreal Alaska."
1,12,HOME RANGES OF RUSTY BLACKBIRDS BREEDING IN WETLANDS: HOW MUCH WOULD BUFFERS FROM TIMBER HARVEST PROTECT HABITAT?,"['Powell, LL', 'Hodgman, TP', 'Glanz, WE']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100151,NOV 2010,5,"We calculated the home ranges and core areas of 13 adult Rusty Blackbirds (Euphagus carolinus) in Maine to determine (1) the area requirements of breeding adults, (2) whether area requirements of the sexes and of colonial and noncolonial individuals differ, and (3) the proportion of the home range and core area that would be protected by a buffer of no logging of 50-100 m around occupied wetlands. Mean home ranges (37.5 +/- 12.6 ha) and core areas (11.1 +/- 2.8 ha) were large in comparison to those of other breeding icterids, and adults often foraged in multiple unconnected wetlands. Rusty Blackbirds that were part of a loose colony had home ranges and core areas three times larger than those of pairs that nested solitarily, which we speculate may be due to adults following one other to feed on unpredictable emergences of aquatic insects. Home ranges and core areas included a surprisingly small amount of wetland habitat, only 12% and 19% respectively, but adults often foraged in small wet patches (<16 m(2)) in otherwise upland habitat. The 75-m buffers around wetlands that we recommended in a concurrent study may help protect the Rusty Blackbird's nesting habitat, but such buffers contained less than half the average home range, suggesting that they may be of only limited benefit as a conservation strategy for protecting foraging habitat."
1,13,HABITAT OCCUPANCY BY RUSTY BLACKBIRDS WINTERING IN THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI ALLUVIAL VALLEY,"['Luscier, JD', 'Lehnen, SE', 'Smith, KG']",CONDOR,10.1525/cond.2010.100147,NOV 2010,6,"The Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) has declined by 90% since the 1960s, possibly from conversions of forested wetlands in the southeastern U.S. to agriculture. Because its habitat use during the nonbreeding season had not been quantified, we estimated occupancy rates of Rusty Blackbirds wintering in the lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley in relation to habitat type (four types of bottomland forest and adjacent agricultural fields), tree density, canopy cover, and water cover. In January and February, we surveyed 89 sites eight times during 2006, 117 and 109 sites 10 times during 2007 and 2008, respectively. Occupancy of individual birds, estimated from their presence or absence at a site, was generally high and greater in 2006 (0.71) than during either 2007 (0.43) or 2008 (0.37). Occupancy of flocks, estimated from presence or absence of >= 20 individuals, was highest in 2006 (0.46), lowest in 2007 (0.17), and intermediate in 2008 (0.30), possibly because of water levels fluctuating from year to year. Rusty Blackbirds were not as specialized in habitat use as expected; habitat characteristics did not consistently predict occupancy of either individuals or flocks. Occupancy of individuals increased with canopy cover during 2007, and occupancy of flocks decreased with tree density during 2006. In 2008, occupancy of individuals increased with tree density and was higher in wet bottomland forest (0.51) than in other habitats (0.31-0.35). Further research is needed to determine whether this lack of habitat specificity is widespread and possibly the result of diverse food requirements during the nonbreeding season."

We investigated patterns of prebasic molt of the Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) in fall at Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, and developed a new technique for aging based on characteristics of the head plumage acquired during prebasic molt. Furthermore, we investigated the possibility of a prealternate molt among wintering Rusty Blackbirds on the basis of captures in Mississippi and museum specimens from across the species' winter range. Finally, we examined how a prealternate molt might affect the aging of winter birds by plumage. Rusty Blackbirds completed their prebasic molt by the end of September, and immature birds had a more prominent eye ring and a paler chin than adults, allowing a reliable age determination. Previously, the Rusty Blackbird was thought to attain its breeding plumage through feather wear exclusively, but we discovered a partial prealternate molt in our examinations of live captures (76% molting) and museum specimens (59% molting). The prealternate molt was observed in all age and sex classes, was concentrated along the feather tracts of the head, and peaked in occurrence from mid-February to mid-March, when nearly 90% of birds were molting. Between mid-December and mid-February, the prealternate molt did not appear to interfere with aging birds in the hand by the pattern of the eye ring and chin in basic plumage. Age determination later in the spring, however, remains to be investigated."

We examined mercury concentrations in blood and feathers from the wetland obligate and rapidly declining Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) from five regions across North America: three wintering areas in the contiguous United States and breeding areas in the western boreal forests of Alaska and the Acadian forests of northeastern North America. In blood, mercury concentrations in Rusty Blackbirds from the Acadian forest (geometric mean 0.94 mu g g(-1); n = 59) were >3x than in those from Alaska (0.26 mu g g(-1); 107). Wintering birds had blood mercury levels approximately an order of magnitude lower than those of breeding birds (0.07 mu g g(-1); 332). In feathers, mercury concentrations in samples from the Acadian forests exceeded published minimum levels for adverse effects on birds (8.26 mu g g(-1); 45) and were 3x to 7x those observed from the other regions. The mercury concentrations we report in blood and feathers of the Acadian forest population of the Rusty Blackbird are among the highest reported for wild populations of passerines at sites without a known local source of mercury. Mercury should be considered as a potential contributor to the species' dramatic population decline in New England and the Maritime provinces and in other areas where bioavailability of mercury is high."

During the spring of 2007, we located a loose colony of Rusty Blackbirds breeding in Piscataquis County, ME. The core colony consisted of six nests within 6.9 ha. These nests were located within a 70-ha clearcut dominated by regenerating Picea rubens (Red Spruce), P mariana (Black Spruce), and Ales balsamea (Balsam Fir). Within 1500 m of the core colony, we located two ""satellite"" nests in young forests regenerating from heavy partial harvests. We observed mobbing behavior by multiple individuals from different pairs, suggesting that coloniality in this species may be an antipredator strategy."

The role of low drainage divides and interbasin water transfers has received less attention. This study analyzed mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences to assess the processes that could have influenced the phylogeographic patterns of a newly discovered lineage of Galaxias zebratus (hereafter Galaxias zebratus Joubertina) that occurs across two currently isolated river systems close to the Joubertina area in the eastern CFR. Results from both analyses revealed that observed genetic differentiation cannot be explained by isolation between the two river systems. No genetic differentiation was found between the Krom River system and a population from one of the Gamtoos tributaries. Shallow genetic differentiation was found between the Krom and the other Gamtoos populations. Historical river capture events and sea-level changes do not explain the present distribution of Galaxias zebratus Joubertina across the Krom and Gamtoos River systems. Interbasin dispersal during pluvial periods, recent river capture, or recent human-mediated translocation seems to be the most plausible explanations."
1,2,Predatory impact of non-native rainbow trout on endemic fish populations in headwater streams in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa,"['Shelton, JM', 'Samways, MJ', 'Day, JA']",BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,10.1007/s10530-014-0735-9,JAN 2015,2,"Non-native rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss have been widely introduced in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) at the south-western tip of Africa and may pose a serious threat to endemic freshwater fishes in the region. Quantitative information about trout impacts in the CFR is scarce but is urgently needed to guide legislation and management efforts. We used a combination of comparative and experimental approaches to evaluate impacts of introduced trout on native fish populations in headwater streams draining the upper Breede River catchment in the CFR. Fish populations were surveyed, and 19 environmental variables measured, in 24 minimally-disturbed streams, half of which had been invaded by trout. The mean densities of native Breede River redfin Pseudobarbus burchelli, Cape kurper Sandelia capensis and Cape galaxias Galaxias zebratus, were 89-97 % lower in invaded streams than in streams without trout. Furthermore, while native fish were present at all 12 sites without trout, they were not recorded at seven of the 12 invaded sites. None of the measured environmental variables differed significantly between sites with and without trout, and distance-based linear models identified trout density as the best predictor of redfin and kurper density, while galaxias density was best predicted by other environmental variables (riparian vegetation, canopy cover, substrate length, site slope). Native fish <= 40 mm in length were largely absent frominvaded streams, but generally abundant in streams without trout, and a field experiment confirmed that trout selectively consume small redfin. Taken together, these findings constitute evidence that trout have depleted the abundance of CFR-endemic fishes through size-selective predation. It is recommended that managers aim to prevent new trout introductions and consider eradicating trout populations where they pose a threat to highly threatened native species."

Forty-three sites were sampled using backpack electrofishing, snorkel transects and underwater video analysis. In the invaded lower reaches, native Labeobarbus capensis was detected only at very low densities, while three other native fish species were not detected. Alien fish were not detected above a barrier waterfall 5 km upstream of the river's confluence with a reservoir. The fish density of 97 fish per 100 m(2) in non-invaded reaches was more than an order of magnitude higher than that of 7 fish per 100 m(2) in the invaded reach. A total of 470 Micropterus dolomieu and 139 L. capensis were removed from a 4 km treatment zone during the rotenone operation. No fish were detected in this area after the rotenone treatment."

There are few aquatic systems within national parks where one or more of these threats are not prominent, and these collectively support only half of the freshwater fish species occurring in all national parks. Proposed management actions include determination and implementation of Environmental Flow Reserves in stressed systems, management of existing alien fish populations and prevention of new establishments, and regular assessments of fish communities."

Results from this 2006 study suggest that the presence of alien predatory largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, may have influenced abundance and habitat selection of the native Galaxias zebratus at one location in a small CFR mountain stream. Numbers of adults, but not of juveniles, were significantly lower where M. salmoides was present, suggesting a size-specific influence on G. zebratus abundance. Because other studies have found the influence of a predator to be affected by prey size and the diel activity of predator and prey, we measured microhabitat use by adult and juvenile G. zebratus by day and by night. Galaxias zebratus selected deeper, faster-flowing microhabitats more strongly where M. salmoides was present than where it was absent. This suggests that G. zebratus adjusts its habitat use in the presence of M. salmoides, although differences in available habitat, or in interactions with other indigenous species, could be partly responsible for the observed differences. In-stream vegetation presence was strongly positively related to depth and strongly negatively related to velocity at positions where G. zebratus was observed, suggesting that the deeper, slower-flowing microhabitats occupied by G. zebratus were structurally more complex than the shallower, faster-flowing ones."

The role of low drainage divides and interbasin water transfers has received less attention. This study analyzed mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences to assess the processes that could have influenced the phylogeographic patterns of a newly discovered lineage of Galaxias zebratus (hereafter Galaxias zebratus Joubertina) that occurs across two currently isolated river systems close to the Joubertina area in the eastern CFR. Results from both analyses revealed that observed genetic differentiation cannot be explained by isolation between the two river systems. No genetic differentiation was found between the Krom River system and a population from one of the Gamtoos tributaries. Shallow genetic differentiation was found between the Krom and the other Gamtoos populations. Historical river capture events and sea-level changes do not explain the present distribution of Galaxias zebratus Joubertina across the Krom and Gamtoos River systems. Interbasin dispersal during pluvial periods, recent river capture, or recent human-mediated translocation seems to be the most plausible explanations."

Quantitative information about trout impacts in the CFR is scarce but is urgently needed to guide legislation and management efforts. We used a combination of comparative and experimental approaches to evaluate impacts of introduced trout on native fish populations in headwater streams draining the upper Breede River catchment in the CFR. Fish populations were surveyed, and 19 environmental variables measured, in 24 minimally-disturbed streams, half of which had been invaded by trout. The mean densities of native Breede River redfin Pseudobarbus burchelli, Cape kurper Sandelia capensis and Cape galaxias Galaxias zebratus, were 89-97 % lower in invaded streams than in streams without trout. Furthermore, while native fish were present at all 12 sites without trout, they were not recorded at seven of the 12 invaded sites. None of the measured environmental variables differed significantly between sites with and without trout, and distance-based linear models identified trout density as the best predictor of redfin and kurper density, while galaxias density was best predicted by other environmental variables (riparian vegetation, canopy cover, substrate length, site slope). Native fish <= 40 mm in length were largely absent frominvaded streams, but generally abundant in streams without trout, and a field experiment confirmed that trout selectively consume small redfin. Taken together, these findings constitute evidence that trout have depleted the abundance of CFR-endemic fishes through size-selective predation.

Currently, based on morphological data sets, Tomistoma schlegelii (false gharial) is placed within the family Crocodylidae. Molecular data sets consistently support a sister-taxon relationship of T schlegelii with Gavialis gangeticus (Indian Gharial), which is the sole species in Gavialidae. To elucidate the placement of T schlegelii within the extant crocodylians, we have sequenced 352 bp of the dentin matrix protein I (DMPI) nuclear gene in 30 individuals and 424 bp of the nuclear gene C-mos in 74 individuals. Molecular analysis of the DMPI data set indicates that it is highly conserved within the Crocodylia. Of special note is a seven base-pair indel (GTGCTTT) shared by T schlegelii and G. gangeticus, that is absent in the genus Crocodylus, Osteolaemus, and Mecistops. To date, C-mos is the largest molecular data set analyzed for any crocodylian study including multiple samples from all representatives of the eight extant genera. Analysis of these molecular data sets, both as individual gene sequences and concatenated sequences, support the hypothesis that T. schlegelii should be placed within the family Gavialidae.

It is related to a clade of Neogene gharials otherwise restricted to South America. Its geological and geographical settings, along with its phylogenetic relationships, are consistent with two scenarios: (i) that a single trans-Atlantic dispersal event during the Tertiary explains the South American Neogene gharial assemblage and (ii) that stem gharials were coastal animals and their current restriction to freshwater settings is a comparatively recent environmental shift for the group. This discovery highlights the importance of including fossil information in a phylogenetic context when assessing the ecological history of modern organisms."

The gene order conforms to that of other crocodilians sequenced, but the arrangement of some tRNA genes differs from other vertebrates. It shows that the gene order of crocodilians is remarkably conserved. In this study, the relationships among crocodilians were examined in the phylogenetic analysis based on the control conserved regions of 17 crocodilians. The results suggest that the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) joins the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) on a common branch, and then constitutes a sister group to traditional Crocodylidae. Thus, the result supports that G. gangeticus belongs to Crocodylidae.

The odontoid process of the axis bears a strong lateral apophysis, continuous on the anterolateral margin of the centrum. This process has never been observed such developed in other crocodylians. The single preserved posterior cervical vertebra exhibits a particularly short neural spine, much shorter than that is observed in Alligator mississippiensis, Crocodylus porosus, and Gavialis gangeticus. A phylogenetic analysis, including new coding of A. krebsi, provide a result that is globally congruent with previous works, but differs significantly in the relationships of the gavialoids. A. krebsi is more closely related to G. gangeticus than is Eogavialis africanum. The South American Ikanogavialis gameroi and Gryposuchus colombianus form a polytomy, and are more closely related to G. gangeticus than is Piscogavialis jugaliper-foratus, a gavialoid from Peru. The South American gavialoids may thus not be monophyletic. This result may indicate, contrary to previous result, a more complex paleobiogeographic history. Thus, a multiple invasion of South America by gavialoids from Africa is equally parsimonious with a single invasion, and an invasion from South American to Asia is equally parsimonious with an invasion froth Africa.

The mean number of dolphins recorded during upstream surveys was 119.4 +/- 31.8 (range 88-174), with an encounter rate of 1.8 dolphins km(-1) (range 1.4-2.8). During these surveys a rich diversity of other threatened aquatic wildlife was also documented, including the Indian smooth-coated otter Lutrogale perspicillata, gharial Gavialis gangeticus, a variety of freshwater turtles, and 135 water bird species. An assessment of fisheries documented 76 fish species of which 43% were caught exclusively in monofilament gill nets, a gear known to kill dolphins by entanglement. Eight new records of fishes preyed upon by Ganges river dolphins were identified from the stomach contents of two dolphin carcasses (Setipinna brevifilis, Osteobrama cotio cotio, Puntius sophore, Crosochelius latius, Mystus cavasius, Heteropneustus fossilis, Macrognathus pancalus, Sperata seenghala). These fishes and other species previously recorded in the diet of the dolphins composed 33.3% of the total catch sampled in 2001-2003. Interviews of 108 fishing households revealed that literacy rates were low (29.9%) and almost 50% earned less than USD 411 per year. The most important conservation actions that could be taken are for national and state governments to establish civil control and promote the development of community-based fishing cooperatives. These cooperatives could enjoy ownership rights to certain river segments in exchange for employing sustainable fishing techniques that are less injurious to dolphins."
1,6,A check-list of the pentastomid parasites of crocodilians and freshwater chelonians,"['Junker, K', 'Boomker, J']",ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH,NA,MAR 2006,10,"Based on published records and own data a summary is given of the geographical distribution of the currently known species of pentastomid parasites infecting crocodiles and alligators, as well as freshwater chelonians. A brief generic diagnosis is provided for each genus.

Fourteen out of the currently 23 living crocodilian species have been recorded as being host to one or more pentastomes. Out of the 32 pentastome species six are considered species inquirendae. Presently, six genera of crocodilian pentastomes, Agema, Alofia, Leiperia, Sebekia, Selfia and Subtriquetra are recognized. African crocodiles harbour eight pentastome species, six of which have been recorded from the Nile crocodile, Crocodylus niloticus. Three species belong to the genus Sebekia, Alofia being represented by two and Leiperia by only one species. Two species, Alofia parva and Agema silvae-palustris, occur in the dwarf crocodile, Osteolaemus tetraspis, and the slender-snouted crocodile, Crocodylus cataphractus, exclusively, but a single Sebekia species is shared with the Nile crocodile. The genus Agema is endemic to the African region. Infective stages of the pentastome Subtriquetra rileyi, thought to utilize Nile crocodiles as final hosts, have been recovered only from fishes. The largest number of pentastome species is found in the Australasian region. Of these, the Indo-Pacific crocodile, Crocodylus porosus, harbours seven, representing the genera Alofia, Sebekia, Leiperia and Selfia. Selfia is exclusive to the latter host. The genus Subtriquetra has been reported from ""Indian crocodiles"", a term possibly referring to either Crocodylus palustris, Crocodylus porosus or Gavialis gangeticus. Ten species of pentastomes parasitizing the crocodilian genera Alligator, Caiman, Crocodylus and Melanosuchus have been recorded from the Neotropical region including the southern states of the North American continent. The two most wide-spread pentastome genera, Alofia and Sebekia, have been recorded together with representatives of the genus Subtriquetra and immature and larval forms of Leiperia.

To date the two monospecific genera, Pelonia, from two terrapin species, Pelusios sinuatus and Pelomedusa subrufa, in South Africa, and Diesingia from Hydraspis geoffroyana and Hydromedusa tectifera in South America, are the only chelonian pentastomes recovered world-wide. A possible exception is the crocodilian pentastome Sebekia mississippiensis which can reach maturity in experimentally infected terrapins."

Chompy is a putative miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) family initially recovered from the genome of Alligator mississippiensis (American alligator) but also present in the genomes of Crocodylus moreletii (Morelet's crocodile) and Gavialis gangeticus (Indian gharial). The element has all of the hallmarks of MITEs including terminal inverted repeats, possible target site duplications, and a tendency to form secondary structures. We estimate the copy number in the alligator genome to be similar to 46,000 copies. As a result of their size and unique properties, Chompy elements may provide a useful source of genomic variation for crocodilian comparative genomics. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Gavialidae includes one species, the gharial, Gavialis gangeticus. In this study we have examined crocodilian relationships in phylogenetic analyses of seven mitochondrial genomes that have been sequenced in their entirety. The analyses did not support the morphologically acknowledged separate position of the gharial in the crocodilian tree. Instead the gharial joined the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) on a common branch that was shown to constitute a sister group to traditional Crocodylidae (less Tomistoma). Thus, the analyses suggest the recognition of only two Crocodylia families, Alligatoridae and Crocodylidae, with the latter encompassing traditional Crocodylidae plus Gavialis/Tomistoma. A molecular dating of the divergence between Alligatoridae and Crocodylidae suggests that this basal split among recent crocodilians took place 140 million years before present, at the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary. The results suggest that at least five crocodillan lineages survived the mass extinction at the KT boundary."

This work is an attempt to fill this gap and to place this taxon in a cladistic phylogenetic context. E. lerichei can be considered a valid basal gavialoid from late Paleocene of North Western Europe, sharing the presence of extremely enlarged foramina aerea on quadrates with the coeval Eosuchus minor from eastern North America (formerly described as Gavialis minor). These two species can be considered sister taxa and, for priority reason, they should be both ascribed to genus Eosuchus. The results of the cladistic analysis show that the European species possess characters that can be considered as slightly derived if compared to those of its American relative, suggesting an eastward dispersion from North America before the Paleocene-Eocene boundary and before the full opening of the Atlantic Ocean or local evolution from a basal gavialoid stock similar to E. minor. Both species of Eosuchus come from marine outcrops and represent a further evidence for the salt-water tolerance of the earliest stages of Gavialoidea evolutionary history. Despite the present endemicity of the only living gharial, Gavialis gangeticus, the historical biogeography of gavialoids shows a lost global distribution and reveals several transoceanic dispersals."

The true gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii), as their common names imply, have appeared in all cladistic morphological analyses as distantly related species, convergent upon a similar morphology. In contrast, all previous molecular studies have shown them to be sister taxa. We present the first phylogenetic study of Crocodylia using a nuclear gene. We cloned and sequenced the c-myc proto-oncogene from Alligator mississippiensis to facilitate primer design and then sequenced an 1,100-base pair fragment that includes both coding and noncoding regions and informative indels for one species in each extant crocodylian genus and six avian outgroups. Phylogenetic analyses using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference all strongly agreed on the same tree, which is identical to the tree found in previous molecular analyses: Gavialis and Tomistoma are sister taxa and together are the sister group of Crocodylidae. Kishino-Hasegawa tests rejected the morphological tree in favor of the molecular tree.

Currently, based on morphological data sets, Tomistoma schlegelii (false gharial) is placed within the family Crocodylidae. Molecular data sets consistently support a sister-taxon relationship of T schlegelii with Gavialis gangeticus (Indian Gharial), which is the sole species in Gavialidae. To elucidate the placement of T schlegelii within the extant crocodylians, we have sequenced 352 bp of the dentin matrix protein I (DMPI) nuclear gene in 30 individuals and 424 bp of the nuclear gene C-mos in 74 individuals. Molecular analysis of the DMPI data set indicates that it is highly conserved within the Crocodylia. Of special note is a seven base-pair indel (GTGCTTT) shared by T schlegelii and G. gangeticus, that is absent in the genus Crocodylus, Osteolaemus, and Mecistops. To date, C-mos is the largest molecular data set analyzed for any crocodylian study including multiple samples from all representatives of the eight extant genera. Analysis of these molecular data sets, both as individual gene sequences and concatenated sequences, support the hypothesis that T. schlegelii should be placed within the family Gavialidae.

Here, we describe a new Oligocene gharial, Aktiogavialis puertoricensis, from deltaic - coastal deposits of northern Puerto Rico. It is related to a clade of Neogene gharials otherwise restricted to South America. Its geological and geographical settings, along with its phylogenetic relationships, are consistent with two scenarios: (i) that a single trans-Atlantic dispersal event during the Tertiary explains the South American Neogene gharial assemblage and (ii) that stem gharials were coastal animals and their current restriction to freshwater settings is a comparatively recent environmental shift for the group. This discovery highlights the importance of including fossil information in a phylogenetic context when assessing the ecological history of modern organisms."

The molecule is 16,917 base pairs (bp) in length, and codes for 22 tRNAs, 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs, as well as a control region (D-loop), as is characteristic for mitochondrial genomes of other metazoans. The gene order conforms to that of other crocodilians sequenced, but the arrangement of some tRNA genes differs from other vertebrates. It shows that the gene order of crocodilians is remarkably conserved. In this study, the relationships among crocodilians were examined in the phylogenetic analysis based on the control conserved regions of 17 crocodilians. The results suggest that the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) joins the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) on a common branch, and then constitutes a sister group to traditional Crocodylidae. Thus, the result supports that G. gangeticus belongs to Crocodylidae. The analyses also suggest that the African slender-snouted crocodile (Crocodylus cataphractus) can be treated as an isolated genus, and constitutes a sister group to Crocodylus."

The odontoid process of the axis bears a strong lateral apophysis, continuous on the anterolateral margin of the centrum. This process has never been observed such developed in other crocodylians. The single preserved posterior cervical vertebra exhibits a particularly short neural spine, much shorter than that is observed in Alligator mississippiensis, Crocodylus porosus, and Gavialis gangeticus. A phylogenetic analysis, including new coding of A. krebsi, provide a result that is globally congruent with previous works, but differs significantly in the relationships of the gavialoids. A. krebsi is more closely related to G. gangeticus than is Eogavialis africanum. The South American Ikanogavialis gameroi and Gryposuchus colombianus form a polytomy, and are more closely related to G. gangeticus than is Piscogavialis jugaliper-foratus, a gavialoid from Peru. The South American gavialoids may thus not be monophyletic. This result may indicate, contrary to previous result, a more complex paleobiogeographic history. Thus, a multiple invasion of South America by gavialoids from Africa is equally parsimonious with a single invasion, and an invasion from South American to Asia is equally parsimonious with an invasion froth Africa.

The mean number of dolphins recorded during upstream surveys was 119.4 +/- 31.8 (range 88-174), with an encounter rate of 1.8 dolphins km(-1) (range 1.4-2.8). During these surveys a rich diversity of other threatened aquatic wildlife was also documented, including the Indian smooth-coated otter Lutrogale perspicillata, gharial Gavialis gangeticus, a variety of freshwater turtles, and 135 water bird species. An assessment of fisheries documented 76 fish species of which 43% were caught exclusively in monofilament gill nets, a gear known to kill dolphins by entanglement. Eight new records of fishes preyed upon by Ganges river dolphins were identified from the stomach contents of two dolphin carcasses (Setipinna brevifilis, Osteobrama cotio cotio, Puntius sophore, Crosochelius latius, Mystus cavasius, Heteropneustus fossilis, Macrognathus pancalus, Sperata seenghala). These fishes and other species previously recorded in the diet of the dolphins composed 33.3% of the total catch sampled in 2001-2003. Interviews of 108 fishing households revealed that literacy rates were low (29.9%) and almost 50% earned less than USD 411 per year. The most important conservation actions that could be taken are for national and state governments to establish civil control and promote the development of community-based fishing cooperatives. These cooperatives could enjoy ownership rights to certain river segments in exchange for employing sustainable fishing techniques that are less injurious to dolphins."
1,6,A check-list of the pentastomid parasites of crocodilians and freshwater chelonians,"['Junker, K', 'Boomker, J']",ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH,NA,MAR 2006,10,"Based on published records and own data a summary is given of the geographical distribution of the currently known species of pentastomid parasites infecting crocodiles and alligators, as well as freshwater chelonians. A brief generic diagnosis is provided for each genus.

Fourteen out of the currently 23 living crocodilian species have been recorded as being host to one or more pentastomes. Out of the 32 pentastome species six are considered species inquirendae. Presently, six genera of crocodilian pentastomes, Agema, Alofia, Leiperia, Sebekia, Selfia and Subtriquetra are recognized. African crocodiles harbour eight pentastome species, six of which have been recorded from the Nile crocodile, Crocodylus niloticus. Three species belong to the genus Sebekia, Alofia being represented by two and Leiperia by only one species. Two species, Alofia parva and Agema silvae-palustris, occur in the dwarf crocodile, Osteolaemus tetraspis, and the slender-snouted crocodile, Crocodylus cataphractus, exclusively, but a single Sebekia species is shared with the Nile crocodile. The genus Agema is endemic to the African region. Infective stages of the pentastome Subtriquetra rileyi, thought to utilize Nile crocodiles as final hosts, have been recovered only from fishes. The largest number of pentastome species is found in the Australasian region. Of these, the Indo-Pacific crocodile, Crocodylus porosus, harbours seven, representing the genera Alofia, Sebekia, Leiperia and Selfia. Selfia is exclusive to the latter host. The genus Subtriquetra has been reported from ""Indian crocodiles"", a term possibly referring to either Crocodylus palustris, Crocodylus porosus or Gavialis gangeticus. Ten species of pentastomes parasitizing the crocodilian genera Alligator, Caiman, Crocodylus and Melanosuchus have been recorded from the Neotropical region including the southern states of the North American continent. The two most wide-spread pentastome genera, Alofia and Sebekia, have been recorded together with representatives of the genus Subtriquetra and immature and larval forms of Leiperia.

To date the two monospecific genera, Pelonia, from two terrapin species, Pelusios sinuatus and Pelomedusa subrufa, in South Africa, and Diesingia from Hydraspis geoffroyana and Hydromedusa tectifera in South America, are the only chelonian pentastomes recovered world-wide. A possible exception is the crocodilian pentastome Sebekia mississippiensis which can reach maturity in experimentally infected terrapins."

In this report, we provide the first detailed characterization of an interspersed repeat element in any crocodilian genome. Chompy is a putative miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) family initially recovered from the genome of Alligator mississippiensis (American alligator) but also present in the genomes of Crocodylus moreletii (Morelet's crocodile) and Gavialis gangeticus (Indian gharial). The element has all of the hallmarks of MITEs including terminal inverted repeats, possible target site duplications, and a tendency to form secondary structures. We estimate the copy number in the alligator genome to be similar to 46,000 copies. As a result of their size and unique properties, Chompy elements may provide a useful source of genomic variation for crocodilian comparative genomics. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Gavialidae includes one species, the gharial, Gavialis gangeticus. In this study we have examined crocodilian relationships in phylogenetic analyses of seven mitochondrial genomes that have been sequenced in their entirety. The analyses did not support the morphologically acknowledged separate position of the gharial in the crocodilian tree. Instead the gharial joined the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) on a common branch that was shown to constitute a sister group to traditional Crocodylidae (less Tomistoma). Thus, the analyses suggest the recognition of only two Crocodylia families, Alligatoridae and Crocodylidae, with the latter encompassing traditional Crocodylidae plus Gavialis/Tomistoma. A molecular dating of the divergence between Alligatoridae and Crocodylidae suggests that this basal split among recent crocodilians took place 140 million years before present, at the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary. The results suggest that at least five crocodillan lineages survived the mass extinction at the KT boundary."
1,9,Anatomy and phylogeny of the gavialoid crocodylian Eosuchus lerichei from the Paleocene of Europe,"['Delfino, M', 'Piras, P', 'Smith, T']",ACTA PALAEONTOLOGICA POLONICA,NA,SEP 2005,27,"Originally designated by Dollo in 1907, the holotype of Eosuchus lerichei has never been carefully described but simply cited and compared in a number of papers. This work is an attempt to fill this gap and to place this taxon in a cladistic phylogenetic context. E. lerichei can be considered a valid basal gavialoid from late Paleocene of North Western Europe, sharing the presence of extremely enlarged foramina aerea on quadrates with the coeval Eosuchus minor from eastern North America (formerly described as Gavialis minor). These two species can be considered sister taxa and, for priority reason, they should be both ascribed to genus Eosuchus. The results of the cladistic analysis show that the European species possess characters that can be considered as slightly derived if compared to those of its American relative, suggesting an eastward dispersion from North America before the Paleocene-Eocene boundary and before the full opening of the Atlantic Ocean or local evolution from a basal gavialoid stock similar to E. minor. Both species of Eosuchus come from marine outcrops and represent a further evidence for the salt-water tolerance of the earliest stages of Gavialoidea evolutionary history. Despite the present endemicity of the only living gharial, Gavialis gangeticus, the historical biogeography of gavialoids shows a lost global distribution and reveals several transoceanic dispersals."

The true gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii), as their common names imply, have appeared in all cladistic morphological analyses as distantly related species, convergent upon a similar morphology. In contrast, all previous molecular studies have shown them to be sister taxa. We present the first phylogenetic study of Crocodylia using a nuclear gene. We cloned and sequenced the c-myc proto-oncogene from Alligator mississippiensis to facilitate primer design and then sequenced an 1,100-base pair fragment that includes both coding and noncoding regions and informative indels for one species in each extant crocodylian genus and six avian outgroups. Phylogenetic analyses using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference all strongly agreed on the same tree, which is identical to the tree found in previous molecular analyses: Gavialis and Tomistoma are sister taxa and together are the sister group of Crocodylidae. Kishino-Hasegawa tests rejected the morphological tree in favor of the molecular tree. We excluded long-branch attraction and variation in base composition among taxa as explanations for this topology. To explore the causes of discrepancy between molecular and morphological estimates of crocodylian phylogeny, we examined puzzling features of the morphological data using a priori partitions of the data based on anatomical regions and investigated the effects of different coding schemes for two obvious morphological similarities of the two gharials."

1,1,Unanticipated effect of climate change on an aquatic top predator of the Atlantic rainforest,"['Herrera, J', 'Solari, A', 'Lucifora, LO']",AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,10.1002/aqc.2536,DEC 2015,0,"1. From a biodiversity conservation viewpoint it is crucial to estimate the sensitivity of species and populations to climate change, especially of key species such as top predators.

2. Here, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO) was used as a natural experiment to estimate the sensitivity of a population of the rainforest-dwelling broad-snouted caiman, Caiman latirostris, to extreme floods.

3. Caiman abundance declined by 35% annually between 1996 and 1998, and then increased, without reaching 1996 levels, indicating a marked effect of the 1997 El Nino. Accordingly, the Southern Oscillation Index was positively correlated with caiman abundance, indicating lower caiman abundance with warm ENSO events.

4. The relationship between the relative annual mean abundance of caimans and the maximum daily annual discharge of the Iguazu River was analysed. This relationship was parabolic, with caiman abundance increasing at discharges from 500 to 1500m(3) s(-1) and then decreasing at discharges from 1500 to 2500m(3) s(-1), indicating an adverse effect of both extreme low and high river discharge. No effect of illegal hunting was measurable.

5. This study evaluated whether the negative effect of extremely high water levels on caiman abundance could be due to a decrease in the availability of the habitat more commonly used by small (< 60 cm total length, TL) and medium (60-120 cm TL) caimans. Small and medium-sized caimans used herbaceous/shrub habitats more frequently than large caimans (>120 cm TL), i.e. the type of habitat flooded during extreme floods.

6. An increase in extreme floods, as forecast for the Atlantic rainforest owing to climate change, may seriously affect the population of rainforest caimans through the reduction of adequate habitat for juveniles. This counter-intuitive result, in which an excess of water reduces the abundance of an aquatic top predator, should be considered in conservation plans of rainforest-dwelling crocodilians.

Analyses of G. gangeticus were based on 39 distress calls of three individuals, of which all could be analysed for temporal and spectral parameters. Our results document differences in the call structure of both species. Distress calls of T. schlegelii show numerous harmonics, whereas extensive pulse trains are present in G. gangeticus. In the latter, longer call durations and longer intervals between calls resulted in lower call repetition rates. Dominant frequencies of T. schlegelii are higher than in G. gangeticus. T. schlegelii specimens showed a negative correlation of increasing body size with decreasing dominant frequencies. Distress call durations increased with body size. schlegelii distress calls share only minor structural features with distress calls of G. gangeticus."

1,6,An Expanded Combined Evidence Approach to the Gavialis Problem Using Geometric Morphometric Data from Crocodylian Braincases and Eustachian Systems,"['Gold, MEL', 'Brochu, CA', 'Norell, MA']",PLOS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0105793,SEP 8 2014,1,"The phylogenetic position of the Indian gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) is disputed - morphological characters place Gavialis as the sister to all other extant crocodylians, whereas molecular and combined analyses find Gavialis and the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) to be sister taxa. Geometric morphometric techniques have only begun to be applied to this issue, but most of these studies have focused on the exterior of the skull. The braincase has provided useful phylogenetic information for basal crurotarsans, but has not been explored for the crown group. The Eustachian system is thought to vary phylogenetically in Crocodylia, but has not been analytically tested. To determine if gross morphology of the crocodylian braincase proves informative to the relationships of Gavialis and Tomistoma, we used two-and three-dimensional geometric morphometric approaches. Internal braincase images were obtained using high-resolution computerized tomography scans. A principal components analysis identified that the first component axis was primarily associated with size and did not show groupings that divide the specimens by phylogenetic affinity. Sliding semi-landmarks and a relative warp analysis indicate that a unique Eustachian morphology separates Gavialis from other extant members of Crocodylia. Ontogenetic expansion of the braincase results in a more dorsoventrally elongate median Eustachian canal. Changes in the shape of the Eustachian system do provide phylogenetic distinctions between major crocodylian clades. Each morphometric dataset, consisting of continuous morphological characters, was added independently to a combined cladistic analysis of discrete morphological and molecular characters. The braincase data alone produced a clade that included crocodylids and Gavialis, whereas the Eustachian data resulted in Gavialis being considered a basally divergent lineage. When each morphometric dataset was used in a combined analysis with discrete morphological and molecular characters, it generated a tree that matched the topology of the molecular phylogeny of Crocodylia."

Herein, the DNA barcoding technique is evaluated for three Indian crocodiles by analyzing an approximately 750-bp barcode region. The alignment result shows interspecific variations between sequences for discrimination of the three Indian crocodiles leading to species identification. The phylogenetic analyses also substantiate the established crocodilian relationships, which add further advantage to use this DNA barcoding approach for Indian crocodiles. This study provides preliminary evidences for the use of DNA barcoding technique in the identification of Indian crocodile species."

This longirostrine condition has been associated with a diet comprising a higher proportion of fish and smaller prey items compared to taxa with broader, more robust snouts. The evolution of longirostrine morphology and a bulbous anterior rosette of premaxillary teeth also occurs in the spinosaurid theropod dinosaurs, leading to suggestions that at least some members of this clade also had a diet comprising a notable proportion of fish or other small vertebrates. Here we compare the rostral biomechanics of the spinosaurs Baryonyx walkeri and Spinosaurus c.f. S. aegyptiacus to three extant crocodilians: two longistrine taxa, the African slender-snouted crocodile Mecistops cataphractus and the Indian gharial Gavialis gangeticus; and the American alligator Alligator mississippiensis. Using computed tomography (CT) data, the second moments of area and moments of inertia at successive transverse slices along the rostrum were calculated for each of the species. Size-independent results tested the biomechanical benefits of material distribution within the rostra. The two spinosaur rostra were both digitally reconstructed from CT data and compared against all three crocodilians. Results show that African slender-snouted crocodile skulls are more resistant to bending than an equivalent sized gharial. The alligator has the highest resistances to bending and torsion of the crocodiles for its size and greater than that of the spinosaurs. The spinosaur rostra possess similar resistance to bending and torsion despite their different morphologies. When size is accounted for, B. walkeri performs mechanically differently from the gharial, contradicting previous studies whereas Spinosaurus does not. Biomechanical data support known feeding ecology for both African slender-snouted crocodile and alligator, and suggest that the spinosaurs were not obligate piscivores with diet being determined by individual animal size."

Boat-based daylight surveys to date only provide indices of relative abundance, without measures of survey bias or error. No attempt to quantify detection probabilities in these surveys has yet been made, and thus, absolute density estimates of this population remain unknown. We surveyed 75 km of the River Chambal and photographed individual gharials for capturerecapture analysis. The total sampling effort yielded 400 captures. Population closure was supported (z = -1.48, P = 0.069), and closed-population models were used to estimate abundances. Models were selected using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) index of model fit. The best model estimated 231 +/- 32 adult, 83 +/- 23 subadult and 89 +/- 19 juvenile gharials (Mean +/- SE), respectively, while the model-averaged estimate was 220 +/- 28 adult, 76 +/- 16 subadults and 93 +/- 16 juvenile gharials, respectively. The best model estimated absolute densities of 3.08 +/- 0.43, 1.11 +/- 0.3 and 1.19 +/- 0.25 adult, subadult and juvenile gharials km-1, respectively, while the model-averaged estimate was 2.93 +/- 0.37, 1.01 +/- 0.21 and 1.24 +/- 0.21 adult, subadult and juvenile gharials km-1, respectively, compared with relative densities of 0.94, 0.45 and 0.30 adult, subadult and juvenile gharials km-1, respectively, from boat-based daylight surveys.

Used within the framework of capturerecapture analysis, photoidentification provides a reliable and noninvasive method of estimating population size and structure in crocodilians. We also opine that without determining the current status of gharials, highly intensive strategies, such as the egg-collection and rear-and-release programmes being implemented currently, initiated on the basis of underestimates of population sizes, are unwarranted and divert valuable conservation resources away from field-based protection measures, which are essential in the face of threats like hydrologic diversions, sand mining, fishing and bankside cultivation."

The gharial, Gavialis gangeticus (Gmelin 1789), a piscivorous reptile of Asian river systems, is increasingly threatened by diverse human pressures.

2. Three survey expeditions were launched to monitor gharial populations, notable wildlife, and the activities and attitudes of local people in a 110km stretch of the Chambal River in the National Chambal Reserve (NCS), India.

3. Only 15% of gharial observed in December 2009 were in the upstream 54% of the surveyed river length. This coincides with the highest density of disturbance including water pumps, fishermen, and the highest growth in fishing activity since December 2008.

4. Although fishing is recognized as a significant threat to gharial, no strong relationship was found between numbers of gharial and fishermen. However, numbers of water pumps, indicative of the intensity of agricultural activity, had a negative relationship with gharial numbers. This relationship was strengthened by omitting the upstream (Pali to Rameshwaram) survey reach, the tourist area of the NCS, which is also potentially affected by upstream reaches.

5. The downstream 46% of surveyed river length in December 2009 supported 85% of gharial (consistent with trends in other surveys), including 91.6% of males and 81.8% of juveniles. This reach is classified as a High Population Recorded Area of high potential conservation importance, also containing better habitat quality and lower human disturbance.

6. A positive relationship was found between gharial numbers and sand habitat features. However, the Davar to Ghoonsai survey reach had low gharial numbers despite abundant sand features, perhaps due to a substantial length of the Ghoonsai sand bank having been converted or agriculture. This may have significant implications for gharial conservation. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

2. This study presents a survey (2003/2004) of the largest Nepalese gharial population in the Chitwan National Park that has benefited from regular re-introduction of young gharials since 1981.

3. Population size estimates fluctuate between 34 (2003) and 38 (2004). The reintroduction programme, although of limited success, has helped to maintain the gharial population.

4. Gharials bask preferentially in large sand banks, and these sites must be protected.

5. The main threats are from a dam that causes fish depletion and flushes gharials from the protected area, sand mining and grazing that destroy basking sites, fishing that causes food shortage, drift nets that kill gharial, and water pollution.

6. Improvement in the survival of reintroduced gharials is needed. Strict protection of preferred basking sites and prohibition of fishing in the main settling zones are the principal conservation measures while in the long term, education and participatory management by local people are also necessary.

Phylogenetic analyses (maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference) based on the mt protein-coding genes at the nucleotide level were performed among crocodilians for which complete mt genomes were available. The results suggest that the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) joins the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) on a common branch, that constitutes a sister group to traditional Crocodylidae. In this report, Mecistops cataphractus is evidently most closely related to Osteolaemus tetraspis. They are isolated as sister taxon from the main clades in Crocodylus.

DNA-based identification of species using PCR-RFLP technique for an apt identification of all the three Indian crocodile species namely, Crocodylus porosus, Crocodylus palustris and Gavialis gangeticus is presented here. A 628 bp segment of cytochrome b gene was amplified using novel primers followed by restriction digestion with three enzymes i.e., HaeIII, MboI, and MwoI, separately and in combination.

The species diversity of inland waters is among the most threatened of all ecosystems and in many parts of the world it is in continuing and accelerating decline. Such decline could be restrained by acknowledging the scope of target species, so that all relevant stages in their life cycle are considered.

2. The gharial Gavialis gangeticus is a prominent riverine species of the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra and Mahanadi river systems that is becoming increasingly rare due to reduction in water flow and available nesting beaches, modification of river morphology and increased mortality in fishing nets. Despite these threats, scientific information on habitat selection by gharial is still inadequate, which hinders conservation measures.

3. This paper presents the population status, basking site selection and water depth preferences of different size-classes of gharial based on a study conducted in the National Chambal Sanctuary, India.

4. Between 1992 and 2007 a 40% decline in the gharial population was observed in the National Chambal Sanctuary. The decline was prominent in the recruitment class (< 120 cm), which primarily comes from the nests laid in the wild, and also in sub-adults (> 180 to 270 cm) comprising both wild and reintroduced gharial.

5. Along the Chambal River, gharial preferred sandy parts of the river banks and sand bars for basking and showed less preference for rocky river banks and rocky Outcrops. Clay river banks were least preferred.

6. Juvenile gharials < 120 cm and 120-180 cm preferred water depths 1-3 m and 2-3 m, respectively. Gharial > 180 cm (including sub-adults and adults) preferred water depths > 4 m.

7. Increasing demands for sand for development activities, and water abstraction for irrigation and energy generation coupled with mortality in fishing nets, are likely to affect gharial and other aquatic species, and steps need to be taken to maintain the minimum river flow necessary to sustain ecosystem processes.

Slender-snout skulls are one of five identified eusuchian cranial ecomorph shape categories (ESCs) thought to reflect functional or ecological specialization. This paper tested the effect of transitions among general, blunt and slender ESCs on cranial character-state distributions in phylogeny using the concentrated changes test. In addition, 'tree-free' character compatibility analysis of character independence was conducted on the morphological character matrix to determine if character correlations are observed independent of specific tree topologies. Results suggest cranial ESCs do affect cranial character-state gains in phylogeny. Concentrated changes identify a broad suite of character-state changes that significantly correlate with transitions to slender, general and blunt ESCs on morphological, molecular and combined-data tree topologies, but numbers of correlated characters for each category differ according to topology. Character compatibility analysis results do not mirror the concentrated changes test results and reflect hierarchically distributed support throughout the data. As cranial ESCs affect character-state transitions, it is possible that nonphylogenetic variables could affect inferences of crocodilian phylogeny by affecting cranial morphology."

The new taxon can be distinguished from all other species of Proctocaecum Baugh, 1957 by the combination of the following morphological characters: a single row of 23 cephalic spines, lateral anal pores opening at uneven levels, a forebody accounting for 16% of the total body length (TBL), an oral to ventral sucker width ratio of 1:0.7, an oral sucker to pharynx width ratio of 1:0.6 and uterine loops that occupy 59-67% of the TBL. While sharing some morphological characteristics with Acanthostomum slusarskii Kalyankar, 1977 from Crocodylus palustris (Lesson) in India, P. gairhei n. sp. is distinguished from the latter by possessing the solid muscular gonotyl diagnostic for Proctocaecum, by the number of cephalic spines, position of the anal pores and egg size. The existing cladogram for Proctocaecum was expanded using the character information of P. gairhei n. sp. The host range of Proctocaecum is now known to include all three families of the order Crocodylia."
