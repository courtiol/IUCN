AB Preeclampsia (PE) is a multisystem disorder unique to Homo sapiens that
   is known to cause maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity.
   Between 5-7% of all pregnancies are affected by PE and it is responsible
   for approximately 50,000 maternal deaths annually. The pathogenesis of
   PE remains poorly understood. However, the results of this study
   indicated that insufficient decidualization plays a significant role.
   NR5A1 and NR5A2 are orphan members of the Ftz-F1 subfamily of nuclear
   receptors and are involved in mammal follicular development, female
   reproduction, steroidogenesis, and decidualization. The expression of
   NR5A1 and NR5A2 in the human decidua and their functions during
   decidualization were investigated using in vitro cultured cells by
   real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and siRNA
   techniques. The results demonstrated that the levels of NR5A2 mRNA and
   protein in the decidual tissues of women with PE were lower than those
   of normal pregnant women. However, the levels of NR5A1 mRNA and protein
   did not significantly differ between groups. The expression of NR5A2 was
   upregulated after in vitro decidualization, but the expression of NR5A1
   remained low and showed no difference compared with that of the control
   cells. Knocking down of NR5A2 in human endometrial stromal cells (hESC)
   resulted in a significant reduction in their expression of
   decidualization markers (IGFBP1 and PRL) and signaling pathway molecules
   (WNT4 and BMP2) (P < 0.05). From these data, we concluded that NR5A2 is
   pivotal for the decidualization of decidual tissues and cultured human
   endometrial stromal cells. Disorders of the endometrium in decidual
   tissues may be associated with the abnormal decidualization thought to
   cause PE.

TI Co-dispersal of the blood fluke Schistosoma japonicum and Homo sapiens

AB The global spread of human infectious diseases is of considerable public
   health and biomedical interest. Little is known about the relationship
   between the distribution of ancient parasites and that of their human
   hosts. Schistosoma japonicum is one of the three major species of
   schistosome blood flukes causing the disease of schistosomiasis in
   humans. The parasite is prevalent in East and Southeast Asia, including
   the People's Republic of China, the Philippines and Indonesia. We
   studied the co-expansion of S. japonicum and its human definitive host.
   Phylogenetic reconstruction based on complete mitochondrial genome
   sequences showed that S. japonicum radiated from the middle and lower
   reaches of the Yangtze River to the mountainous areas of China, Japan
   and Southeast Asia. In addition, the parasite experienced two population
   expansions during the Neolithic agriculture era, coinciding with human
   migration and population growth. The data indicate that the advent of
   rice planting likely played a key role in the spread of schistosomiasis
   in Asia. Moreover, the presence of different subspecies of Oncomelania
   hupensis intermediate host snails in different localities in Asia
   allowed S. japonicum to survive in new rice-planting areas, and
   concurrently drove the intraspecies divergence of the parasite.

TI The evolution of Homo sapiens denisova and Homo sapiens neanderthalensis
   miRNA targeting genes in the prenatal and postnatal brain.

AB BACKGROUND: As the evolution of miRNA genes has been found to be one of
   the important factors in formation of the modern type of man, we
   performed a comparative analysis of the evolution of miRNA genes in two
   archaic hominines, Homo sapiens neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens
   denisova, and elucidated the expression of their target mRNAs in bain.
   RESULTS: A comparative analysis of the genomes of primates, including
   species in the genus Homo, identified a group of miRNA genes having
   fixed substitutions with important implications for the evolution of
   Homo sapiens neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens denisova. The mRNAs
   targeted by miRNAs with mutations specific for Homo sapiens denisova
   exhibited enhanced expression during postnatal brain development in
   modern humans. By contrast, the expression of mRNAs targeted by miRNAs
   bearing variations specific for Homo sapiens neanderthalensis was shown
   to be enhanced in prenatal brain development.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of changes in miRNA
   gene sequences in the course of Homo sapiens denisova and Homo sapiens
   neanderthalensis evolution. The genetic alterations of miRNAs regulating
   the spatiotemporal expression of multiple genes in the prenatal and
   postnatal brain may contribute to the progressive evolution of brain
   function, which is consistent with the observations of fine technical
   and typological properties of tools and decorative items reported from
   archaeological Denisovan sites. The data also suggest that differential
   spatial-temporal regulation of gene products promoted by the
   subspecies-specific mutations in the miRNA genes might have occurred in
   the brains of Homo sapiens denisova and Homo sapiens neanderthalensis,
   potentially contributing to the cultural differences between these two
   archaic hominines.

TI Caspase cleavage of iASPP potentiates its ability to inhibit p53 and
   NF-kappa B

AB An intriguing biological question relating to cell signaling is how the
   inflammatory mediator NF-kB and the tumour suppressor protein p53 can be
   induced by similar triggers, like DNA damage or infection, yet have
   seemingly opposing or sometimes cooperative biological functions. For
   example, the NF-kappa B subunit RelA/p65 has been shown to inhibit
   apoptosis, whereas p53 induces apoptosis. One potential explanation may
   be their co-regulation by common cellular factors: inhibitor of
   Apoptosis Stimulating p53 Protein (iASPP) is one such common regulator
   of both RelA/p65 and p53. Here we show that iASPP is a novel substrate
   of caspases in response to apoptotic stimuli. Caspase cleaves the
   N-terminal region of iASPP at SSLD294 resulting in a prominent 80kDa
   fragment of iASPP. This caspase cleavage site is conserved in various
   species from zebrafish to Homo sapiens. The 80kDa fragment of iASPP
   translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus via the RaDAR nuclear
   import pathway, independent of p53. The 80kDa iASPP fragment can bind
   and inhibit p53 or RelAp65 more efficiently than full-length iASPP.
   Overall, these data reveal a potential novel regulation of p53 and
   RelA/p65 activities in response to apoptotic stimuli.

AB Geologically, Panama belongs to the Central American land-bridge between
   North and South America crossed by Homo sapiens > 14 ka ago.
   Archaeologically, it belongs to a wider Isthmo-Colombian Area. Today,
   seven indigenous ethnic groups account for 12.3% of Panama's population.
   Five speak Chibchan languages and are characterized by low genetic
   diversity and a high level of differentiation. In addition, no evidence
   of differential structuring between maternally and paternally inherited
   genes has been reported in isthmian Chibchan cultural groups. Recent
   data have shown that 83% of the Panamanian general population harbour
   mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) of Native American ancestry. Considering
   differential male/female mortality at European contact and multiple
   degrees of geographical and genetic isolation over the subsequent five
   centuries, the Y-chromosome Native American component is expected to
   vary across different geographic regions and communities in Panama. To
   address this issue, we investigated Y-chromosome variation in 408 modern
   males from the nine provinces of Panama and one indigenous territory
   (the comarca of Kuna Yala). In contrast to mtDNA data, the Y-chromosome
   Native American component (haplogroup Q) exceeds 50% only in three
   populations facing the Caribbean Sea: the comarca of Kuna Yala and Bocas
   del Toro province where Chibchan languages are spoken by the majority,
   and the province of Colon where many Kuna and people of mixed
   indigenous-African-and-European descent live. Elsewhere the Old World
   component is dominant and mostly represented by western Eurasian
   haplogroups, which signal the strong male genetic impact of invaders.
   Sub-Saharan African input accounts for 5.9% of male haplotypes. This
   reflects the consequences of the colonial Atlantic slave trade and more
   recent influxes of West Indians of African heritage. Overall, our
   findings reveal a local evolution of the male Native American ancestral
   gene pool, and a strong but geographically differentiated unidirectional
   sex bias in the formation of local modern Panamanian populations.
